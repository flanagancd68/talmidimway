&lt;p&gt;In THE LOGOS We see the revelation of the Apostle John, a first-century Galilean Jew, of the Word becoming flesh. To understand his words, we need to understand them from a first-century Galilean Jewish perspective. Jesus brings the revelation and glory of God into the world of men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospels are Jewish documents. 1st Century “Christianity” was a Jewish sect.
John is often viewed as contrasting the correct way of Christianity with the incorrect way of Judaism, but this represents what is called an anachronistic fallacy, often shortened to “Anachronism” - misappropriation of concepts and ideas in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sometimes see inadvertent anachronisms in period-piece movies. An actor playing a cowboy might be wearing a digital watch in a movie set in the 18th century.  In the movie “Back to the Future,” at the 1955 enchantment under the sea dance, Marty McFly is playing a 1958 Gibson guitar.  Of course, something made in 1958 would not have existed in 1955.  That’s an anachronism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a challenge to restrain our own presuppositions, our set of established beliefs, when we read the Bible.  It is natural to assume a biblical speaker to affirm our presuppositions in order to justify our positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overarching anachronistic fallacy many commentators commit is to take what is called “the parting of the ways” between Judaism and Christianity that occurred much later (2nd-4th centuries CE) and reading it back into this text in the 1st century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, since it had not occurred yet, there is absolutely no way John or any other biblical writer could have the split between Judaism and Christianity in view when they were writing.  Even to say something like “the 12 Apostles were Christians” is an anachronism.  Since the term “Christian” hadn’t been coined yet, they would have viewed themselves as Jewish followers of their Jewish Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next term is “Presuppositions,” which refers to those things we have accepted as true without needing external verification.  It can a challenge to restrain our own presuppositions, our set of established beliefs, when we read the Bible.  If we are taught something over and over, we naturally accept that thing as true and don’t challenge it.  Most of the time this poses no issue, but problems can arise when what we accept as true, may not be true, or at least not true in every specific application.  For example, when we read the Bible, we often subconsciously assume a biblical speaker affirms all of our presuppositions.  For example, if I have been taught that Jesus had combative exchanges with ALL religious leaders, then when I read the Bible, I’m going to read all exchanges between Jesus and the religious leaders as combative.  I will draw this conclusion even when a plain, surface reading of the text doesn’t necessarily support such a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I superimpose my presuppositions into the biblical text, we call that &amp;ldquo;eisegesis.&amp;rdquo;  Modern conservative scholars would all agree that eisegesis is bad yet many of us do it almost automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we strive for is EXEGESIS, understanding the text IN CONTEXT to extract what the author was saying.  To do this, we must first realize the gospels are Jewish documents written within a historical context of 2nd Temple Judaism.  The audience were Jewish Christ followers together with many non-Jews who had joined a Jewish sect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early church fathers affirmed John’s authorship of this Gospel strongly and unanimously. Some of the fathers claim to have personally known those who knew John in Ephesus in his later years, thus making a direct link to the tradition of Johannine authorship. The evangelist John is shown here with the symbol of an eagle, the one of the four living creatures which is traditionally associated with him (Ezekiel 1:5-10 and Revelation 4:6-7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-11&#34;&gt;John 1:1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logos in the normal sense means “word or speech”.  In this prologue, John uses it in the mystical sense.  He alludes directly to the beginning of the Torah and the beginning of creation.  He starts this with an intentional allusion to Genesis 1:1 “In the beginning”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-12-6&#34;&gt;John 1:2-6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. 6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall the first act of Creation. “and God said Let there be Light, and there was light.”&lt;br&gt;
In verse 4  John declares that this life had always been available through God’s word, which is the same word that he identifies with Jesus (IVP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John 1:5, The divine light from the first day of creation shines once again into the dark world of man, signifying a new creation (COM)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excavations in the early 2000s revealed this cave west of Jerusalem near Ein Kerem. Archaeologist Shimon Gibson identified it with the ministry of John the Baptist on the basis of a stick-figure drawing of a man inside the cave. Gibson’s theory was published in The Cave of John the Baptist (Doubleday, 2004).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For responses, see that by James F. Strange (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/reviews/the-cave-of-john-the-baptist/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/reviews/the-cave-of-john-the-baptist/&lt;/a&gt;) and Todd Bolen (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bibleplaces.com/cave-of-john-the-baptist/%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://www.bibleplaces.com/cave-of-john-the-baptist/)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the writing of the church father Origen (AD 185-254), the location of John’s baptizing at Bethany beyond the Jordan has been located at a point near the river opposite Jericho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-17&#34;&gt;John 1:7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;7  He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some scholars note that John has a “legal” feel.  As you read John&amp;rsquo;s gospel, be on the lookout for the terms Witness, Testimony, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, John is interested not only in establishing Jesus’ credentials, he is also interested in “convicting” the corrupt Jerusalem establishment on the grounds of usurption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/01-the_logos_files/01.Picture7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;30%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discovered in Cave 4 of Qumran in the early 1950s, this text contains five biblical verses that focused on the coming of the Messiah. This artifact was photographed in the Amman Museum.&lt;br&gt;
A few scholars suspect John may have been part of the Essene sect, but in any case he was definitely influenced by them.  The Essenes believed that the forces controlling Jerusalem and the Temple were usurpers and priests of darkness.  They juxtaposed darkness and light just as John does throughout his writings.   “in the Dead Sea Scrolls, the forces of light and darkness were engaged in mortal combat, but light was predestined to triumph” (IVP)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-18-13&#34;&gt;John 1:8-13&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;8 He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light. 9 The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. 11 He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. 12 But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, 13 who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is a spiritual rebirth, not relying on our ethnic descent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerusalem was the home of David and place where his greater Son was appointed to rule over the nation.  John uses a term Ioudaioi, which get’s translated as “jews” but many scholars believe this is too generic.  Think of the term “Americans” -The Americans won the Gold medal in 1980 (a group of 20 hockey players).  The Americans invaded Normandy (those members of the Army and the Navy in June 1944).  The Americans imposed Tariffs on China (specifically referring to the Government).  The Americans pay their taxes on April 15 (most Americans but not all - children don’t pay taxes).  The Americans are guaranteed freedoms under the Constitution (all Americans)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the term &amp;ldquo;Jews&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot; could be anywhere from All Jews - which we know is not in view here because the 1st Century church was nearly 100% Jewish.   Unfortunately many commentators, view it as exactly this: John is an early Christian Anti-Jewish document.  It is more likely that what is in view is not rejection by all-Israel, but rather rejection by a sub-group within Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What might some of these sub-groups be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could maybe refer those in Judea who generally rejected as opposed to those in Galilee where Jesus was largely accepted. But even here, not all Judeans rejected him.  Nicodemus for example.  Several scholars believe Ioudaoi specifically refers to the ruling establishment, which for the most part wanted Jesus out of the picture.  Again Nicodemus is an exception and there were probably others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many commentaries place the blame on all Israel, which could be painting with too broad of a brush.  It would be like holding all 300 million Americans responsible for something done by a small group of corrupt politicians in Washington DC.  With that said, a national guilt might also be in view- America is a sinful and unrepentant nation, even though many Americans do repent of their sin.  Deuteronomy 9:23 states, “You rebelled against the command of the LORD your God; you neither believed Him nor listened to His voice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, we must allow God to own the business of judgment.   it is wrong to use our holy book to specifically condemn a group of people (as the church as done to Jews for the last 2000 years).  We are to love our neighbors and pray for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish thought of the day was that to be a true Child of God, one had to be a Child of Abraham, either through birth or conversion (even today, Ben Avraham is a common name a gentile takes when converting to Judaism).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John is setting the stage that it is not ethnic affiliation but spiritual rebirth that matters.  A topic that will be developed in John Chapter 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-114-15&#34;&gt;John 1:14-15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;14  And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. 15  (John bore witness about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A father’s only son” would remind readers of Genesis 22, where God instructed Abraham “take your son, your only son whom you love, Isaac&amp;hellip;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/01-the_logos_files/01.Picture8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:left&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The star in the Church of Nativity in Bethlehem marks the spot where tradition says that Mary gave birth to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the Greek mind, the invisible spiritual real is far superior to the earthly realm.  However, God created man spirit and flesh.  Our flesh only became corrupt AFTER the fall.  God intended there to be a union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verb translated above as “dwelt” (skenoo) is related to the Greek word for “tabernacle” (skene). Just as God dwelt with his people in the tabernacle, so the Word tabernacled with his people in the incarnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-11618&#34;&gt;John 1:16:18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;16 For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. 17 For (as) the (Torah) was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 18 No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father&amp;rsquo;s side, he has made him known.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 17 is often translated “for the law came through Moses &lt;em&gt;BUT&lt;/em&gt; Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “BUT” is a mistranslation (possibly intentional) - it is not in the Greek.  John just got through saying that Jesus was there in the beginning.  This means Grace and Truth where there in the beginning.  The Law has a special role to play for the nation of Israel but it is not in any way antithetical to the Gospel of Jesus.  John sees Jesus as affirming the covenant promises God made in the Torah.  A better reading might be “for AS the Torah was given through Moses, Grace and Truth came through Jesus Christ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “but” originally occurred in the King James Version.  The anachronistic error here involves the 16th Century division between Protestants and Catholics regarding the function of the law in the life of the believer.  One of the Reformation cries was “Faith alone”.  It wasn’t until Luther that “Law” and “Grace” became opposites.  Superimposing this view on the Biblical Text is simply not correct.  The oppose of Law is lawlessness.  The oppose of grace is disgrace.  It is wrong to view any part of the Bible as lawless or disgraceful!  God’s Law is a good and beautiful thing.  Read Psalm 119!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;study-questions&#34;&gt;Study Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can anachronisms and eisegesis be a problem in my studies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways does John 1:1-5 parallel Genesis 1 and how does that change my thinking of Genesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I think “His own” in verse 11 refers to all Jews?  Why or why not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did my opinionAs I reflect on the “tabernacle” discussion in John 1:14, how does (or how should) this affect my walk with Jesus?
change after this lesson?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did my understanding of the Law/Old Testament change after studying 1:17?  How can I apply this going forward?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In JOHN THE IMMERSER, Herod the Great’s sons have divided up the holy land, and the Holy Temple has fallen into the hands of a corrupt and Romanized priesthood. We turn our attention away from palaces and politics to seek a prophet, the voice of one calling in the wilderness. We find John the Immerser preaching on the other side of the Jordan River, near Bethany. John prepares the way through immersion and repentance. The waters of the Jordan River run with history and spiritual significance. Those waters have served as a place of renewal for the people of Israel more than once. The people seeking the prophet and his immersion must cross over its waters again to re-enter the land with a new heart and new commitment to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In messianic Jewish circles, John the Baptist is often referred to as “John the immerser.” The reason for this is the term “Baptist” has become somewhat of a charged term theologically (positively and negatively). Immersion reminds us that Christian baptism has its roots in Jewish ritual immersion in a pool of “living water” (either a spring-fed river or lake, or a cistern used to collect rainwater) and is not an entirely new practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-time-of-the-beginning&#34;&gt;The time of the beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;th&gt;Mat 3:1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Mar 1:1,4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luk 3:1-2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God…John appeared baptizing in the wilderness&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Augustus was the Caesar at the time of Jesus’ birth; in 14 he was succeeded by Tiberius. If we assume Luke is counting from the beginning of Tiberius’ reign as Emperor (which is only an assumption) 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; year would place us in 27/28. Other commentators use other dates to come up with anywhere from 26-30 CE/AD. This results in a crucifixion date between 29-33 CE being defendable. Often the date one picks for the start of His ministry depends on the bias one holds regarding a Friday crucifixion and the Daniel 9 prophecy – we’ll get to both of those questions much later in our study. Unless you need a topic for a PhD thesis in seminary, I recommend we hold dates VERY loosely there’s a lot of ambiguity with calendar conversions and dating methods. Luke says Jesus was ”about thirty” when He started his ministry – if He started in the year 28, he would have been in his mid-30s (remember He had to be born prior to 4 BC when Herod the great died).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The region of Judea, Samaria and Idumea was first given to Archelaus, who as we mentioned last time fits the modern definition of a train wreck. He was deposed in 6 CE and was exiled. At this time Rome brought in Governors or Procurators, All Rome asked of its citizens was “pay your taxes and don’t revolt”. The procurators were tasked with seeing to both things. The procurators were headquartered at the palace in Caesarea but tended to visit Jerusalem during the feast days where large numbers of Jews &lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:2.45972in;height:2.39375in&#34; /&gt;(most of whom hated Rome) congregated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of Jesus, the procurator was Pontius Pilate. Some scholars doubted Pilate’s existence until a stone with an inscription referencing Pontius pilate prefect of Judea was found at Caesarea. The stone was found in the theater at Caesarea upside down. Even back then they were into recycling. Pontius Pilate was appointed governor of Judea in AD 26/27, and he held the post until March of AD 37. This inscription was found in secondary use in the theater of Caesarea. A suggested restoration reads: “Pontius Pilate, Prefect of Judea, made and dedicated the Tiberium to the Divine Augustus.” The stone is the first and only mention of Pilate from an archaeological source. Today a replica is on display at the national park in Caesarea and the original is in the Israel Museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herod Philip had the northern districts including villages such as Bethsaida and Caesarea Philippi where Peter will later make his famous declaration. When asked “who do YOU say I am”, Peter answered, “you are the Messiah.” Jesus asks us that same question today and every day. In the Gospels, the scene at Caesarea Philippi is the high-water mark of sorts. Jesus would now begin to teach and repeat overtly that he would suffer and die. Both thematically as well as geographically, the rest of the gospels picture Jesus moving from Caesarea Philippi with Peter’s proclamation, which should have been EVERYONE’s proclamation, up to Jerusalem where he would be crucified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Herod that will give Jesus the most trouble is Antipas. Antipas was over galilee and the territory east of the Jordan called Perea. John the Baptist will accuse Antipas of adultery, and even the Jewish historian Josephus records that Antipas was politically threatened by John the Baptist. Jesus calls Antipas a “fox” in Luke 13 and they finally met face to face on the day Jesus was crucified. Jesus was before pilate being interrogated. When Pilate learned that Jesus was from Galilee, Pilate was concerned about a jurisdictional issue and had Jesus transferred to Antipas. Jesus said nothing to Antipas who mocked him and sent Jesus back to Pilate where he was given over to be crucified. Antipas would eventually be exiled just as his brother Archelaus was and replaced by Herod Agrippa I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Decapolis (which means “ten cities) were gentile territory where Jesus fed the 4000 and expelled the demons into the herd of pigs, which Chuck Missler affectionally labels, “the first case of deviled ham”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schlegel notes that “Jews were unhappy with this complicated arrangement of foreign roman domination.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In other words, Messianic hopes were high that God would correct this situation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster reports that between the time John’s father Zechariah served in the temple and the start of John’s ministry, the Romans began to sell the office of the high priest to the highest bidder, and of course, it only was awarded to those loyal to Rome. Annas was like a mafia godfather. Josephus records the political intrigue that resulted in Caiaphas being appointed High Priest, with Annas behind the scenes pulling the strings. The family controlled the high priesthood between 6 and 66. You know the saying about absolute power corrupting absolutely. These were the corrupt Sadducees and they virtually controlled the Sanhedrin in the days of Jesus and Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we get the idea that all of Jesus’ opponents were a single collective group – not so – the Pharisees tried to live their lives strictly by the word of God, so they detested the politically corrupt Sadducees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilderness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Judean wilderness between Jerusalem and Jericho is virtually uninhabitable apart from a few isolated monasteries first built in the Byzantine period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying “The word of God came to John” is linking John with the Old Testament prophets who received supernatural revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wilderness recalls the 40 years wilderness wanderings in Exodus. Lancaster: “Just as he led them into Canaan in the past, He will lead them from the wilderness into the Messianic Era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Lexham Geographic Commentary, Aubrey Taylor notes, “The wilderness paradoxically symbolizes chaos and distance from God, as well as a place for God to create new life and order. In the wilderness, God created a people and bound them to Himself, laying a foundation for the future nation. John likely believed he was initiating God’s return by enacting prophetic passages in a literal way within the wilderness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark begins his gospel narrative here, completely bypassing the birth and childhood events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark presents Jesus as the servant of all and focuses primarily on what Jesus did to serve mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essentially Peter’s gospel, and it moves like Peter did. Quick fire hits. We can imagine Peter dictating to Mark in Hebrew, while Mark translated into Greek, trying to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark does not have a genealogy because, as Missler says, “we aren’t interested in the pedigree of a servant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.3&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;3 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, “The voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.4&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;4 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Now John wore a garment of camel&#39;s hair and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.5&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;5 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.6&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;6 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.2&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;2 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, “Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.3&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;3 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight,’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.4&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;4 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.5&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;5 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.6&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;6 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Now John was clothed with camel&#39;s hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.3&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;3 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And he went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.4&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;4 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, “The voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.5&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;5 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall become straight, and the rough places shall become level ways,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.6&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;6 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;What do you say about yourself?” [23] He said, “I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as the prophet Isaiah said.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 3:2 says, “repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” This is John’s gospel message. It is also Jesus’ gospel message (Matthew 4:17) and it is also the disciples’ Gospel message (Matthew 10:2). Note the gospel message is not “believe in me so you can live however you want and still go to heaven when you die”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repent means return to God, literally it means to turn around and go the other direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kingdom of heaven, as interpreted by Rabbi Lichtenstein is “both the external state where Messiah reigns over the whole earth and the internal state of the individual who is forgiven and spiritually regenerated by the LORD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is at hand – the kingdom messianic age is about to begin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All four gospels say that John’s ministry fulfills Isaiah 40:3. The Isaiah passage begins with “comfort, comfort my people” (40:1) and then goes into the voice of one crying in the wilderness (40:3). God’s Comfort is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism and its Jewish predecessor immersion in a Mikveh carries a tie to ritual cleanliness and confession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the firstborn son of a priest, John should have been serving in the temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was either disenfranchised and pushed out by the corruption, or he voluntarily withdrew because he wanted nothing to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible does not tell us that he abandoned his priestly obligations, so we need to be cautious with inferring this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do have some suggestion that John affiliated with another group of disaffected priests known as the Essenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Essenes lived at Qumron and are presumed to be the authors of the dead sea scrolls. Qumron is located in the Judean Wilderness on the Northwestern shore of the Dead Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They opposed the sold-out, corrupted, Rome-loving, Hasmonean and Sadducean priesthood of Jerusalem.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars debate whether he was formally an Essene, merely was familiar with the Essenes and shared some similarities, or was not affiliated with them in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster writes, “John and his disciples are associated with, and at points, endorsed by the Pharisees; this would not have happened if John were a known Essene.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His attire alludes to Elijah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2Ki 1:8 They answered him, “He wore a garment of hair, with a belt of leather about his waist.” And he said, “It is Elijah the Tishbite.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jordan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the area of, and perhaps the exact location where Moses called the nation to make a covenant with the LORD and Joshua crossed the river and lead Israel into the promised land.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locusts &amp;amp; wild honey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 7:33 reminds us John was a Nazirite from birth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“John entrusted himself solely to God for his daily needs,”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which is reminiscent of the Israelites in the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deu 29:5-6 I have led you forty years in the wilderness. Your clothes have not worn out on you, and your sandals have not worn off your feet. [6] You have not eaten bread, and you have not drunk wine or strong drink, that you may know that I am the LORD your God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locusts could be insects or it could be carob pods from the locust tree, a tree that would have been available in parts of the Judean wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honey could refer to the syrup of dates and figs in addition to bee honey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John exemplified Jesus’ teaching on “do not be worried about what you will eat or drink” (Matthew 6:25)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His attire alludes to Elijah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John wore clothing that was not purchased in the markets of Jerusalem. John’s dress reminded the people of the prophet Elijah, who wore a garment of hair (2 Kgs Mark 1:8). Indeed, John came in the spirit and power of Elijah to warn of impending judgment before the Lord’s appearance (Mal 3:1-6; 4:5-6).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.8&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;8 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Bear fruit in keeping with repentance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.7&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;7 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; He said therefore to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.8&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;8 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Bear fruits in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.9&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;9 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.10&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;10 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And the crowds asked him, “What then shall we do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.11&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;11 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And he answered them, “Whoever has two tunics is to share with him who has none, and whoever has food is to do likewise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.12&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;12 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Tax collectors also came to be baptized and said to him, “Teacher, what shall we do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.13&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;13 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And he said to them, “Collect no more than you are authorized to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.14&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;14 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Soldiers also asked him, “And we, what shall we do?” And he said to them, “Do not extort money from anyone by threats or by false accusation, and be content with your wages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the seeker-friendly message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus will have a lot to say about bearing fruit during His ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say it often, but our works matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t do good works to get saved; we do good works because we already are saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A healthy fruit tree will bear fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are saved, there should be evidence of good works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By saying “Bear fruit in keeping with repentance” John is confirming that immersion must be an outward expression of an inward change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He didn’t see any fruit of an inward change, so he refused to permit the outward expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Matthew mentioning Pharisees and Sadducees we might get the impression that John is rejecting the religious and allowing sinners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why there is value of comparing passages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke makes it clear that John rejected ANYONE who was unrepentant, whether they were in vocational ministry or everyday folk such as soldiers and common folk, or vocational sinners such as tax-collectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 21:32 also references John ministering to prostitutes, which can include “fallen women” for any reason not limited to sex for hire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did not single out just the religious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What he is likely railing against here is what we might call “cheap grace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when the golden calf incident happened, God was ready to wipe the people out, Moses ”reminded” God of his promises to Abraham and God relented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, it became fashionable to rely on their familial connection to righteous Abraham to cover up sins in much the same way that Christians invoke the atoning sacrifice of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is when they invoke Abraham, or we invoke Jesus to exonerate us from personal responsibility.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we will note is the old adage whenever you point a finger at someone, there are three fingers pointing back at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we do this today? Do we ever say “well, I’m saved by Jesus so I’m forgiven”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we say that from a posture of contrition and repentance it’s absolutely true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we say it as an excuse to keep on sinning WITHOUT repenting, then it’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What shall we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After shooting painfully straight with his audience the faithful asked “what then shall we do?” There’s hope in this. None of us are beyond the father’s reach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John prescribes acts of lovingkindness, called chesed in Hebrew; these deeds achieve the spirit of the commandment to love one’s neighbor as one’s self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of note, John allowed them to stay in their occupations provided they conduct their lives with the highest standards of ethics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soldiers here are unlikely to be Roman soldiers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John’s ministry did not extend to gentiles and Romans would have had no interest in anything Jewish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given where he was (Perea), the soldiers were likely employed by Herod Antipas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These stones&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Joshua 4, God commanded stones of rememberance be placed to mark the moment where Israel was consecrated and crossed in to inherit the promised land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, the words for “stones” and “sons” only differ by one letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A possible point could be a warning for them to not rely on cheap grace. In other words, “don’t fool yourselves. There are plenty of genuinely repentant righteous people who produce good fruit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also a sense could be “be like the original generation who crossed at this location by faith.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Judaism, a gentile convert receives the title “Son of Abraham.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.11&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;11 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; “I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.7&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;7 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And he preached, saying, “After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.8&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;8 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.15&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;15 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As the people were in expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Christ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.16&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;16 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; John answered them all, saying, “I baptize you with water, but he who is mightier than I is coming, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Joh 1:19-28 And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?” [20] He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.” [21] And they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.” [22] So they said to him, “Who are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” [23] He said, “I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as the prophet Isaiah said.” [24] (Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.) [25] They asked him, “Then why are you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” [26] John answered them, “I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know, [27] even he who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.” [28] These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John’s message was that the Messianic Age was about to commence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This naturally led some to wonder whether John was the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In John 1:20, he says that he is not the messiah but is the forerunner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Talmud records, “a disciple must render to his teacher all the service that a slave renders to his master except that of loosening his shoe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John is saying “I’m not even worthy to be regarded as Jesus’ slave.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water vs Holy Spirit and fire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrival of Messiah has two different implications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the believers who repent and bear fruit (the righteous), Jesus brings an immersion in the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the unbelievers who don’t repent and don’t bear fruit (the wicked), the coming of Messiah brings judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book of Proverbs is our go-to reference when we study the righteous versus the wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the righteous, as it is today with Christian baptism, water is an outward sign that symbolizes spiritual regeneration in the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus Jesus says in John 3:5, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;th&gt;Matthew 3:12&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luke 3:17-18&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Reference&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.12&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;12 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.17&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;17 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.18&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;18 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; So with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mal 4:1&lt;/sup&gt; “For behold, the day is coming, burning like an oven, when all the arrogant and all evildoers will be stubble. The day that is coming shall set them ablaze, says the LORD of hosts, so that it will leave them neither root nor branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mal 4:5-6&lt;/sup&gt; “Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes. [6] And he will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the land with a decree of utter destruction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that day they would take a tool like a pitchfork and toss the kernels up into the air. The heavier seed would drop into one pile and the lighter chaff would be carried downwind into a separate pile. This was usually done on a plateau called a threshing floor. At the end the seeds would be gathered into a barn or a storehouse, and the chaff would be burned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew and Luke develop this theme of spirit vs fire with a quick one-verse parable, which we may call “the winnower, the wheat, and the chaff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winnowing fork = instrument of Messiah’s judgment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winnower’s hand = Messiah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threshing floor = Land of Israel/or the world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barn = the Kingdom of Heaven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheat = repentant righteous&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaff = unrepentant wicked - The image of the wicked as chaff is common in the Old Testament (Ps 1:4; Isa 40:24; Dan 2:35).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning: Messiah is coming to punish the wicked and reward the righteous. I, John, am bringing you this good news and therefore begging each of you to repent and do works of righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, John is the fulfillment (at least partially) of Malachi 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many believe Elijah himself is one of the two witnesses in Revelation 11, at which time Malachi’s prophecy would be completely fulfilled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John’s mission was to call God’s people to repentance and right behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it’s as if John is saying, “you can &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; me you’re repentant, but you need to prove it to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When things are going well it&amp;rsquo;s easy to trick ourselves into thinking that God must be really proud of our piety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all must turn to God for our provision. Again we don’t do good works to get saved, we do good works and bear good fruit because we are saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fruit of repentance is a life of good deeds that reflect our love for God and our love for our neighbors, just as Jesus instructs his disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In IMMERSION AND TEMPTATION, we briefly return to &lt;strong&gt;Nazareth&lt;/strong&gt;. More than two decades have elapsed since we last visited. Yeshua is no longer a precocious twelve-year-old boy; he is a grown man who has taken over His father Joseph’s carpenter trade. From Nazareth, we follow Yeshua’s family to the plains of the &lt;strong&gt;Jordan&lt;/strong&gt;, across from Jericho, where John the Immerser is at work, proclaiming the good news and immersing for repentance&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. After His immersion, we follow Yeshua out into the dry and waterless &lt;strong&gt;Judean&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Wilderness&lt;/strong&gt; between &lt;strong&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jericho&lt;/strong&gt; where He spends forty days in prayer and fasting, concluding with His three temptations.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passages&lt;/strong&gt;: Matthew 3:13-4:11 (Mark 1:9-13, Luke 3:21-23, 4:1-13; John 1:29-34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:90%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This map&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; traces Jesus’ early ministry, including leaving Nazareth to be baptized by John (Mark 1:9) leading to His baptism in the Jordan (box 1), followed by His temptation in the Judean wilderness (box 2). We don’t know exactly where (or when) Jesus was baptized. Because of a few references, including the apparent proximity to Jerusalem (Mark 1:5) and the reference to “these stones” in the Luke and Matthew accounts suggest opposite Jericho near (or quite probably at) the location where Joshua led the Israelites across in Joshua 4. This site is marked by a traditional holy site today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not disputing a southern location for Jesus’ baptism, some scholars, including William Schlegel the publisher of this map, contend “Bethany beyond the Jordan” is not located across from Jericho but much further north in the Golan Heights (marked by box 3 on the map). They point out that it does not say that Jesus was baptized at Bethany; but in John’s gospel, it appears as if John is recollecting Jesus’ baptism which occurred at least 40 days earlier and in a different location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aubrey Taylor has noted that in the same region where Moses commissioned Joshua, and Elijah commissioned Elisha, Jesus receives a similar commission from John.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The photo on the bottom&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is the same area today. The most significant issue in that part of the world, since ancient times and continues today is water rights. Before 1948 the area was sparsely populated. After 1948 with the founding of both the modern states of Israel as well as Jordan, the area began to grow, and all those new people needed food and food requires water from the Jordan river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-baptized-by-john-in-the-jordan&#34;&gt;Jesus baptized by John in the Jordan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mat 3:13-15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mar 1:9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John 1:29-31&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. John would have prevented him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?” But Jesus answered him, “Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he consented.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! This is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who ranks before me, because he was before me.’ I myself did not know him, but for this purpose I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it’s only a few verses in our Bibles, we need to remember that John and Jesus had probably never met until this day (and unlikely that John would remember doing a somersault in his mother Elizabeth’s womb over 30 years earlier); however, John 1:31 could also be interpreted that John initially did not recognize that Jesus was the Messiah, not that they were entirely unfamiliar with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, by now, we presume Joseph has died and Jesus has been left in charge of Mary and Jesus’ many siblings. John apparently recognized Jesus as soon as they saw each other and makes a Passover allusion to the sacrificial lamb and Isaiah 53:7: He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth. John is certainly foreshadowing Jesus’ suffering and crucifixion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster paraphrases Matthew 3:14 as, “I need to be baptized by you WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT, yet you come to me to be baptized with water?”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fulfill-all-righteousness&#34;&gt;Fulfill all Righteousness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Jesus Himself did not need to be baptized for his sins, so what does Jesus mean by “fulfilling all righteousness?” Keener notes that Jesus’ response indicates his identification with Israel in obedience to the Law and by extension, larger humanity who DID need purification&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. To fulfill all righteousness means it’s the proper way of doing things in the proper order. A prophet in the spirit and power of Elijah must arise, identify, declare, and anoint the Messiah (who must of course allow Himself to be anointed). By being baptized by John, Jeremy Dehut in Following the Messiah Jesus “testified to the authenticity and authority of John’s message and continued providing an example of faithful submission.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few lessons back we looked at how the verse “out of Egypt I have called my son” exemplifies how Jesus mirrors the nation. As we will see in the next section, Jesus’ 40-day fast recalls Israel’s 40 years in the wilderness. Just as God sustained Israel in the wilderness so He sustained Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we get to the question of why a Sinless Jesus would need a baptism of repentance, we must remember that Jesus is a perfect representative of the nation, just as He is a perfect and sinless representative of humankind. As a representative of Israel, Jesus “passes through the waters of the Jordan” just like the Nation did. His “repentance” (so to speak) represented the “corporate guilt and confession”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of His people. Taylor goes on to say that Jesus’ temptations can also be viewed in light of this representative role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.17&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; and behold, a voice from heaven said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; And a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.21&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.22&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, like a dove; and a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.23&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And John bore witness: “I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him. I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’ And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Psalm 2:7&lt;/sup&gt; I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, “You are my Son; today I have begotten you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen 22:2&lt;/sup&gt; He said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 11:2&lt;/sup&gt; And the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 42:1&lt;/sup&gt; Behold my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights; I have put my Spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:60%; float:right&#34; /&gt;When I visited Israel in February 2013, I took this picture of a pair of doves at Jesus’ traditional baptism site. I wonder if they were only there for the tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that day many believed that God had gone silent. So, the heavens opening and the spirit poured out indicated that the Messianic era had arrived. John earlier proclaimed, “the kingdom of heaven is at hand” (Mat 3:1). “A kingdom needs a king and a messianic era needs a messiah.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s voice and John’s prophetic testimony are the two witnesses required to establish a matter; in this case, the stamp of approval on Jesus as Messiah. The Spirit would signify that the Messianic era is at hand. The spirit resting on Jesus could be an allusion to Genesis 1, where the Spirit of God moved over the surface of the waters, and Genesis 8, where the dove flew out over the waters and, finding no other place to land, came to “rest” on Noah (noach means rest in Hebrew). Despite our impression of doves as docile and peaceful, they are notoriously territorial. Lancaster writes, “His disciples probably understood Him to mean a sudden, startling rush of wind – only slightly less jarring than being struck by lightning.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My beloved son” could also be read as “my son, the beloved” or even “my son, whom I love” which also recalls Genesis 22 when Abraham is told “take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love and go to the land of Moriah and offer him there as a burnt offering”. Isaac is a type or a foreshadow of Jesus who would be sacrificed, thus Lancaster notes in apostolic theology, the “beloved one” becomes a title for the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this seems to highlight the messianic prophecy of Isaiah 11:2 “And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon Him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 3:23 says Jesus was “about 30” when He began His ministry. We should not take this to mean exactly 30. The precise date of one’s birth was not especially relevant in the ancient world. Lancaster supposes that this is 28 CE, which if he was born in 5 or 6 BCE makes Jesus 34 years old here and then 36 years old when he died. According to Jewish tradition, Isaac was also 36 at the time of his binding on the altar in Genesis 22.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.4.2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; And after fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.4.2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing during those days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image5.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:80%&#34; /&gt;Bolen writes, “Because of its lack of water and good routes, the Judean wilderness&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; has been (mostly) uninhabited throughout history. Consequently, it was an ideal place for those seeking refuge from enemies or retreat from the world. John the Baptist preached here, and it seems likely that this was the wilderness where Jesus was tempted.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener writes, “Jesus was led into the wilderness just as Israel was led. Just as Moses fasted for 40/40, so did Jesus.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In fact, Mark 1:12 emphatically says the spirit forcibly drove Jesus out into the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is a shadow of both Moses and Israel. They were tested and God sustained them all. Jesus passed the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Christian traditions observe lent, where we abstain from certain pleasures, if not do a partial fast for 40 days between Ash Wednesday and Resurrection story. We do this in honor of Jesus’ 40 days in the wilderness. Jewish people similarly observe 40 days of Teshuva (“repentance”) which recalls the 40 years wandering in the wilderness (which is said to be one year for every day the spies were in the land). This concludes with Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement) which is a day of national fasting. Lancaster says, “Jewish liturgy treats the Day of Atonement as a day for dealing with Satan and his accusations. The liturgies of the day are filled with references to a legal showdown between Israel and the devil, which concludes with the scape goat being led out into the wilderness, symbolizing the defeat of evil.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars debate the moment in time when Jesus came to the full realization of His mission and destiny. Many speculate that it was at His baptism that the spirit descended. Lancaster speculates that the Satan’s temptations were an attempt to force Yeshua to question the revelation He just received. Maybe like in some movie where a normal person is given some superhuman ability, the Satan believes Jesus has the desire to try out His new superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three temptations will involve shortcuts to revealing His messianic identity and plan. Remember the phrase Jesus uses frequently between now and the triumphal entry: “My hour is not net come”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the first temptation is declaring that Jesus indeed trusts that revelation that He heard come from the mouth of the LORD. He did not need to prove it. Let’s break it down some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Satan begins with “If you are the son of God.” One of the main limitations of the written word is that we have to use our imaginations with respect to voice inflection and body language. Did the Satan say this scoffingly, inquisitively, or matter-of-factly? Since the Satan is the accuser, it’s not too difficult to imagine him taunting Jesus with this challenge. “Since we know God made manna from heaven in the wilderness if you are that God, you should be able to do the same thing in this wilderness. And by the way, I know you are hungry. Why don’t you just go ahead and fix yourself something to eat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus declines the invitation to demonstrate His messianic power. He will do it on His terms and in His timing. Jesus WILL provide bread, but it will be food for the people, not for Himself. He will serve others, not Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is the Word and the Bread of Life who has come down from heaven. He quotes Deuteronomy 8:3, which is a passage about how “God tested Israel in the wilderness by causing them to hunger and feeding them with manna.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Physical bread will temporarily relieve hunger but the Bread of Life, the very Words of God will cure spiritual hunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first temptation is declaring that Jesus indeed trusts that revelation that He heard come from the mouth of the LORD. He did not need to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.4.6&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, “‘He will command his angels concerning you,’ and “‘On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.4.7&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Jesus said to him, “Again it is written, ‘You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;9 And he took him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 for it is written, “‘He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you,’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 and “‘On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 And Jesus answered him, “It is said, ‘You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psa 91:11-14 For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways. [12] On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone. [13] You will tread on the lion and the adder; the young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot. [14] “Because he holds fast to me in love, I will deliver him; I will protect him, because he knows my name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deu 6:13-16 It is the LORD your God you shall fear. Him you shall serve and by his name you shall swear. [14] You shall not go after other gods, the gods of the peoples who are around you— [15] for the LORD your God in your midst is a jealous God—lest the anger of the LORD your God be kindled against you, and he destroy you from off the face of the earth. [16] “You shall not put the LORD your God to the test, as you tested him at Massah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we compare Matthew and Luke side-by-side we see that Luke reverses the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; temptations. Some may view this as the Gospel authors being unable to keep their stories straight, but another way of looking at it is that this demonstrates a lack of coordination and collusion among the authors. If one witness in a trial recalls she heard a dog bark and then a car horn, but another witness recalls she heard a car horn then a dog bark, we don’t typically assume one or the other is lying. It’s just a different recollection. The differences between Matthew and Luke are not significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is more significant is that leaping from a tall building is not typically a temptation to most people. The next matter is that before they were in the wilderness and now all of a sudden they are in Jerusalem. Scholars debate as to whether this is a vision, or whether they were supernaturally transported. I tend to vote against the vision. The leap has to be potentially fatal for the miracle the Satan is proposing to actually be miraculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a photo of the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The drop today is likely fatal but 2000 years ago, the Kidron valley below was much steeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a reminder that the Satan knows Scripture and he is an expert at making arguments. We need to be like Jesus and know the “whole council” of God so we don’t take Bible passages out of context, and don’t fall for it when others try to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Satan says, “look here. God says He will send His Psalm 91 angels to protect you.” Psalm 91 is a messianic passage (and the Satan knows this). Psalm 91 is a great passage and one we all would do well to memorize and rely on. However, a Tzaddiq (a righteous one) such as Jesus would have known that angelic protection is for ills that befall God’s servants, not for those who foolishly seek out danger. Therefore, we must know our Bible, and therefore we are going through the Gospels verse by verse in this series!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus counters with another passage from Deuteronomy. Note the context of “you shall not test the Lord” is not merely doing something foolish/sinful and asking God to make it right. The context is following after other gods spiritually. When we listen to the lies of the Satan, we are following after a false god. (ouch).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The testing at Massah refers to Exodus 17:7: And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the quarreling of the people of Israel, and because they tested the LORD by saying, “Is the LORD among us or not?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.4.9&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; And he said to him, “All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.4.10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Then Jesus said to him, “Be gone, Satan! For it is written, “‘You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;5 And the devil took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 and said to him, “To you I will give all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 And Jesus answered him, “It is written, “‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deut 6:13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan apparently is now convinced of Jesus’ messianic credentials, now offers Him a shortcut to usher in the Messianic Kingdom. Satan also likely knew the people were hoping for a conquering, military messiah. Here was a chance for Jesus to be this and skip all of that cross business. This might also be the Satan’s plea bargain; we make a deal here and I don’t go to the lake of fire later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer to Hebrews reminds us that Jesus “has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin” (Hebrews 4:15). As Missler used to quip, “If I offer to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge, are you tempted to buy it from me? Probably not, because you are relatively certain that I don’t own it. For this to be a valid temptation, that means Jesus is acknowledging that Satan has ownership of these things, and they truly are his to give away. Jesus doesn’t challenge Satan’s ownership.” One of the many subthemes in the Bible is what I might call “things out of place.” We opened the Gospels with King Herod ruling over the land, who was neither born king nor born Jewish. Herod’s power and riches were juxtaposed against the rightful king who came lowly in a cave surrounded by deplorable shepherds. In the last lesson, we saw John the Baptist, the son of Zechariah who officiated in the temple in Jerusalem. John, a Levite, should have been in Jerusalem at the temple but instead, we find him “exiled” to the wilderness, while the usurping Sadducees are running the Temple. Here, the world that rightly belongs to God is under the authority of the Satan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t know which mountain. Mt. Nebo would have been nearby in the wilderness. Mt. Nebo is where Moses surveyed the land. Others have suggested Mt. Hermon in the far north of Israel and is the highest peak in the land of Israel. Mt. Hermon is intriguing because of its association with demonic activity in antiquity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;worship-me&#34;&gt;Worship me&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Satan said, “worship me,” he wasn’t necessarily asking Jesus to change His mind and start following Satan with His whole heart (although he certainly could have been). During the days of the seven churches in Revelation, Rome generally let people, particularly Jews, practice their religion without interference (depending on who was in charge). But often what they had to do was, one day a year, offer a sacrifice to the emperor. In the seven letters, Jesus sternly chides those who are compromising in this way. This is still idolatry, no matter how seemingly insignificant the idolatrous act is. Conversely, Jesus lavishly praises those in Smyrna and other cities who kept themselves pure from idolatry. In fact, the Bible uses an interesting metaphor for idolatry: adultery. Idolatry is spiritual fornication and unfaithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a story of a mother who caught her child doing something and the response was “mom, I only did it once and it was only a little. I’m ok.” A few days later the mom made a batch of brownies and the son of course got very excited. He took one bite and the happiness immediately gagged. “What’s wrong honey,” said the mom. “These taste awful,” said the son. “What happened?” “Hmm that’s strange,” said the mom. “I only put a little bit of dog poo in the brownies. Not even a teaspoon. They should be ok.” Point made. Jesus demands complete purity. There will come a day when Jesus will take proper possession of the things of the earth that are currently in the hands of the usurper. There will be no shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion-the-devil-departs&#34;&gt;Conclusion: the devil departs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.4.11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and were ministering to him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13 And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13 And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark and Luke give us interesting tidbits. Mark says he was with the wild animals and Luke says the devil departed until “an opportune time.” We infer that opportune time was at the Garden of Gethsemane. The animals underscore the point that Jesus was completely isolated. Satan often likes to attack us when we are isolated from other believers. The photo shows the Ibex, a type of wild goat that is common in the Judean wilderness.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-from-the-temptations&#34;&gt;Lessons from the Temptations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus concludes each test the way any good rabbi would; He makes an appeal to Scripture. “As it is written…” should be a phrase we as Talmidim begin to use frequently as we continue to learn to be imitators of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three temptations parallel the warning given in 1 John 2:15-17: Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world. And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bread – desire of the flesh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kingdoms – desire of the eyes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throw yourself down and angels will save – pride of life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Satan is basically recycling the approach he used in the Garden: “So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food (flesh), and that it was a delight to the eyes (eyes), and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise (pride of life), she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate” (Gen 3:6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first Adam couldn’t resist the temptation, but the Last Adam did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Episode 3 of the “Following the Messiah” series covers the Baptism and Temptation of Jesus. It is very much worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In THE FIRST SIGN, we join Yeshua and His handful of followers in the Jordan River Valley near Jericho. We follow them north along the eastern side and pick up more disciples on Lake Galilee’s north shore in Bethsaida and Capernaum. A fishing boat takes us across the lake to Magdala.  From there, it’s a day’s walk to Cana of Galilee on the northern slopes of the Nazareth ridge, where Yeshua and His first followers attend a wedding. From there, we follow them back to Capernaum on the north shore of Lake Galilee, where they join a pilgrimage making their way down the Jordan Valley, following its eastern bank, before crossing near Jericho and ascending to Jerusalem for the Festival of Passover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-gospel-of-john-as-a-legal-document&#34;&gt;The Gospel of John as a legal document&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 He came as a &lt;strong&gt;witness&lt;/strong&gt;, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 He was not the light, but came to bear &lt;strong&gt;witness&lt;/strong&gt; about the light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 Johnn bore &lt;strong&gt;witness&lt;/strong&gt; about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19 And this is the &lt;strong&gt;testimony&lt;/strong&gt; of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 He &lt;strong&gt;confessed&lt;/strong&gt;, and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21 And they &lt;strong&gt;asked&lt;/strong&gt; him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22 So they said to him, “Who are you? &lt;strong&gt;We need to give an answer&lt;/strong&gt; to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;31 I myself did not know him, but for this purpose I came baptizing with water, &lt;strong&gt;that he might be revealed&lt;/strong&gt; to Israel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;32 And John bore &lt;strong&gt;witness&lt;/strong&gt;: “I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;34 And I have seen and have borne &lt;strong&gt;witness&lt;/strong&gt; that this is the Son of God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;who-were-the-ioudaioi&#34;&gt;Who were the &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.875in&#34; alt=&#34;C:\PLBLsr\apr4\Priestly blessing during Sukkot at Western Wall, tb092302017.jpg&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The translation of Ioudaioi always and only as “Jews” sends the reader in the opposite direction from what the author intended.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will develop this in later lessons but John the Gospel Writer, is very loose with his terminology. &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt;, which is the word John uses that is typically translated as “the Jews”, could mean anything from all Jews, to all believing Jews, to those in leadership of the Jewish religious establishment, to those geographically in or from Judea, some other subset&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if Ioudaioi refers to the religious establishment, John may be indenting for us to understand a specific subset of that. For example, Nicodemus was part of the &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; religious establishment, but we can be confident he is not part of the &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; with whom Jesus has any quarrel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an analogy we could use the term “Americans” The Americans won the gold medal in 1980. All 300 million of us? No. 20 hockey players representing the country. We could also say the Americans bombed Syria. Well that doesn’t all 300 million of us, but maybe a squadron of planes acting on order from one President. We also say today that “the House passed” some piece of legislation; all that could mean is at least 50% of those present+ 1, not all 435 House members acting in unison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many of us have learned to see the “Jews” especially as John uses it has a negative connotation to mean ALL Jews everywhere. The gospel of John has been used to support anti-Semitic behavior in the name of Jesus. This is incorrect and terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the 1st-century church consisted of &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt;, so it is an error to say that ALL &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; are guilty of rejecting and killing Jesus. There are believing &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; and rejecting &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt;. The temple establishment opposed to Jesus and ultimately those who arrested Him and had Him executed could have been a very small number. Perhaps less than 35 and maybe even less than 20: in other words, a very small group of hidden players acting behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, we need to make sure some latent anti-Semitic bias is removed from our reading. We need to work to discern the context and which Ioudaioi group John is referencing. If the context is negative, it is probably only the “deep state” fraction of the Temple establishment. This group was primarily Sadducees and Herodians with a small number of Pharisees along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we see the term “Ioudaioi” we will leave it untranslated to remind us that we need to be Bereans and explore the context in which John uses the term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;geographic-setting&#34;&gt;Geographic setting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:5.07014in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 1:28 tells us that “these things took place in Bethany across the Jordan where John was baptizing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good scholars dispute the location of “Bethany Beyond the Jordan”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Location of Jesus’ baptism is widely believed to be in the vicinity of Jericho, but this doesn’t mean that John the Baptist didn’t have different locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some, such as Schlaegel&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, hold that “Bethany” is actually north, in the Golan heights, which would account for disciples from Galilee being present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first four disciples known to be in Jesus’ company at this point are all from Bethsaida: Andrew, John (the unnamed disciple), Peter, and Philip.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter and Andrew would later move to Capernaum (Mark 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems logical that Peter, Andrew, James and John probably had a fishing cooperative, perhaps as a customs tax avoidance ploy as one boat would be registered in Capernaum (Herod Antipas’ region) and the other in Bethsaida (Herod Philip’s region).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion with Nathaniel possibly takes place at Bethsaida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will then make their way past Capernaum and Magdala, through the valley of the doves to Cana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the wedding miracle, they will return to Capernaum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-135-37&#34;&gt;John 1:35-37&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples, and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!” The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John would seem to place verse 35 as being the next afternoon following Jesus’ baptism where the spirit came down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might have been the next day but it didn’t need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John, and indeed the entire eastern mindset, is not as bound to a strict chronological record as we in the west have been brought up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust&#34;&gt;Walking in His dust&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like John, we should demonstrate humility and keep our eyes on God’s bigger picture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests but also to the interests of others. (Php 2:3-4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John 1:35, John the Baptist essentially refers two of his own disciples to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a teacher saying, “you should really go to the church down the street; that teacher is better than I am”!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, this is essentially what John the Baptist says to his former disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It speaks of John’s humility and that fact that his eyes were on God’s bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is how it should be with us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-138-39&#34;&gt;John 1:38-39&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, “What are you seeking?” And they said to him, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are you staying?” He said to them, “Come and you will see.” So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi here is transliterated Hebrew, a clue that Jesus and His talmidim spoke Hebrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other places, we will see Raboni, which is transliterated Aramaic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aramaic was the everyday language, while, we presume, Hebrew was used by the devout or in religious settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government language would have been Greek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They probably knew enough Greek to understand commercial transactions and to interact with Roman officials but it is highly doubtful they would have spoken Greek among themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Gospels, the word rabbi always speaks of Jesus (except in Matthew 23 where Jesus discusses the word itself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi in that day was more a term of respect and not, as it means today, a teacher with specific training and ordination who performs a specific role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What are you seeking?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus asks us the same question every day and every moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the disciples, we rarely answer the question directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We answer it by our choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where are you staying?” is an indirect way of asking to follow Jesus. They were answering His question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll unpack this in a later lesson, but it appears that “calling disciples” was a process, not a one-time event (think of the job application and interview process).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Rabbi and his perspective talmidim would take some time to get to know each other before agreeing to a multi-year commitment to one-another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This viewpoint untangles the various “callings” of the disciples that are recorded in the gospels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come and See” – head’s up; pay attention; follow me and learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They stayed with Him that day for it was about the 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; hour”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; hour is probably around 4pm (but it depends on the time of year; an hour wasn’t 60 minutes but 1/12 of daylight).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have suggested this was erev-shabbat, Friday afternoon, and the disciples were hoping to score an invitation to spend Shabbat with the Master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They didn’t just stay with Jesus that “night” but “that day,” meaning Friday night and all day Saturday, Shabbat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine spending Shabbat, a free day, with Jesus. No appointments, no phones or TV; talking Bible until late at night and then again the next morning perhaps after Shabbat prayers at the local synagogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing Jesus, I bet the conversation wasn’t limited to just Bible study; I imagine Jesus challenged them to be better. Perhaps the conversation was uncomfortable but never awkward, because it’s Jesus, our ultimate fiduciary; the One who would lay down His life for our best interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their lives would never be the same; they had found the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times have we breezed past a Bible verse like “and they stayed with Him that day” and not really thought about the implications?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-140-42&#34;&gt;John 1:40-42&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter&amp;rsquo;s brother. He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which means Christ). He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of John. You shall be called Cephas” (which means Peter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learn that one of the two talmidim who spent shabbat with Yeshua that day was Andrew. Scholars presume the other was John himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simon Peter, Andrew, James, and John probably grew up together and were likely in their mid-teens when they first met Jesus.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messiah means “anointed one”; it is a title, which in Greek is translated as Christ. Given the above discussion, his disciples would have referred to Jesus as the Mashiach, Messiah, not “Christ”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A subtle miracle here: Jesus and Peter had not met before, yet Jesus knows not only his first name but his family name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Jew would have recognized this as a sign of a prophet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cephas is a transliteration of Kefa, which means “rock”; rock in Greek is “petros”, which is how we get Peter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably a prophetic nickname about Peter’s future role in the early church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to imagine that it baffled Shimon at the time. “Why are you calling me that? We just met.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He brought him to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Augustine reportedly said, “John’s Gospel is deep enough for an elephant to swim yet shallow enough for a child not to drown.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He finds the messiah. He tells someone else he has found the messiah. He brings that someone else to the messiah. That someone else changed the world for Messiah. (I said that, not Augustine!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-143-44&#34;&gt;John 1:43-44&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, “Follow me.” Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A disciple of that day would be no more inclined to drop everything and follow a complete stranger than we would be today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus casting some sort of spell over his disciples to make them follow him blindly is entirely inconsistent with Jesus’ later passages to count the cost before answering the call to be His disciple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, even though the text doesn’t say this, it seems safe to infer that Philip and Jesus met previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I know I’m usually the first to point out “the text doesn’t say that,” but this is where we need to be Bereans and exclude potential conclusions that are contradicted elsewhere in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I wasn’t there and anything could have happened, on the surface, Philip following Jesus blindly is not consistent with other portions of scripture and is not consistent with what we think we know about 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century discipleship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beit Tzaidah – house of fish nets, or more simply “fish town”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By piecing together various biblical and historical clues, scholars speculate that John’s father Zebedee ran a sizable fishing business that included a partnership with Simon and Andrew as well as his own sons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars began excavating “et Tell” and many have concluded it is the ancient Bethsaida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem in identifying et-Tell with Bethsaida is its distance from the Sea of Galilee and its elevation above the ancient level of the lake&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been there and it’s not so much the distance from the lake as the fact that it is a much higher elevation, even if we account for potentially higher lake levels back in Jesus’ day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT excavators have concluded that the village contained a fisherman’s home based on their discovery of two types of lead net weights. One weight was round, of the so-called musket type, and the second was elongated, similar in shape to a crooked needle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentioned by name seven times in the Gospels, Bethsaida is one of the most frequently mentioned cities in the New Testament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-145-46&#34;&gt;John 1:45-46&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one of whom Moses spoke was the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deut 18:15-18 “The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your brothers—it is to him you shall listen— just as you desired of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly, when you said, ‘Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God or see this great fire any more, lest I die.’ And the LORD said to me, ‘They are right in what they have spoken. I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. And I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 3:22 Moses said, ‘The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers. You shall listen to him in whatever he tells you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though we don’t have legal terms, note how everyone is testifying, as Philip is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathaniel also testifies to Nazareth’s insignificance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more than 200 people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the Davidic connections and the fact that they were likely insular, it is possible outsiders viewed the people of Nazareth as somehow affiliated with the corrupt Jerusalem leadership, which would have been a negative for other Galileans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 21 tells us that Nathaniel is from Cana, which makes the statement about Nazareth that much more of a burn; Cana was as insignificant as Nazareth was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars believe Nathaniel and Bartholomew are one and the same.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-147-49&#34;&gt;John 1:47-49&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!” Nathanael said to him, “How do you know me?” Jesus answered him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Nathaniel’s skepticism, Jesus testifies in Nathaniel’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathaniel means “God gave,” or perhaps “God’s gift.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fig tree reference is apparently something only Nathaniel understood, though generally, the fig tree represents national Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symbolically, trees also represented knowledge and teachers often taught under trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might be a subtle pun: Israel/Jacob WAS a man of deceit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the vision of the angels ascending and descending which Jesus will reference in the next segment, Jacob was fleeing precisely because of his deceit of Esau.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lizorkin speculates that John’s intended audience might have been non-&lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; followers of Israel’s God; for example, Samaritans and Essenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so, Nathaniel’s pronouncement carries more significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is not just King of the &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt;, He is King of all Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-150-51&#34;&gt;John 1:50-51&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus answered him, “Because I said to you, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these.” And he said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly, truly is literally, “amen, amen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Heaven opened” indicates a major revelation from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This imagery evokes Jacob’s dream in Genesis 28:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And he dreamed, and behold, there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it! And behold, the LORD stood above it and said, “I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring.” (Gen 28:12-13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathaniel could have been reading Genesis 28 as he sat under the fig tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Samaritans have a specific attachment to Jacob and his favorite son, Joseph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John 4 we will be at Jacob’s well in Sychar, where the Samaritan woman will ask, “Are you greater than our father Jacob?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Jesus is seemingly anticipating that question and His answer is an emphatic “YES.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angels Jacob saw are not ascending and descending at a place in Samaria but upon Jesus Himself.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is the bridge/ladder between heaven and earth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-21-2&#34;&gt;John 2:1-2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.29514in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus also was invited to the wedding with his disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could refer to the third day of the week, Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, the third day of creation, was the day God said “It was good” twice (1:10 and 1:12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it is the “day of the double blessing,” some speculate that weddings were often held on Tuesdays, but this is disputed&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could also mean simply three days had elapsed since the discussion with Nathaniel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may also be literary bracketing; in John 2:19, Jesus says, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John is not necessarily chronological; while in our minds, John 2 occurs when Jesus is still relatively obscure, it is possible that wedding occurred after Jesus and his disciples had gained some regional notoriety and would be honored guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the map&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, you can see there are two contenders for Cana; one is off the beaten path, and the other happens to be on the main road from Nazareth to Tiberias (in other words, easier for the tour busses)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most scholars I’ve come across tend to side with the less accessible site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than officiating the wedding, Lancaster says that Jewish sages were invited to liven things up. The Talmud records the disciples of Hillel would sing before the bride and others added joy in various ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this tidbit fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there another wedding at some point in our future that Jesus will preside over where He will add joy? YES. You can read about it in Revelation 19 and all of the various wedding feast references in the New Testament – there are several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was about to inject more joy to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-23-5&#34;&gt;John 2:3-5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, “They have no wine.” And Jesus said to her, “Woman, what does this have to do with me? My hour has not yet come.” His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is today, if the host runs out of food or drink at a wedding it would be a major social faux-pas. 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Century Jewish wedding celebrations typically lasted for seven days and the host was responsible for providing this quantity of wine to his invited and uninvited guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commentator John Lightfoot believes that Mary might have had a formal role in the planning of the feast and was not merely being a busy body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Messianic Age is often depicted as a wedding banquet with free-flowing wine&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Holy One, blessed be He, will make a banquet for the righteous in the Garden of Eden…He will give them to drink wine preserved in its grapes since the six days of creation” (Numbers Rabbah 13:2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was Mary asking for the inauguration of the Messianic Age, and this is why Jesus replies as He does?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reply by Jesus to Mary’s request is not nearly as cold-sounding as it is in English and he is not disobeying the commandment to honor His mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can imagine Mary struggled to understand all of the various signs and wonders that she pondered in her heart since before Jesus was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From her response, “it is evident she was neither dissatisfied nor put off&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;” by Jesus’ remark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern speculates that Jesus was attempting to curtail Mary’s natural pride as the mother of the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus WOULD address the literal problem Mary brought to Him; but He would not do it in the public way that she hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say often that the people wanted a political messiah, not the suffering messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Mary didn’t want the political Messiah, then perhaps she wanted the happy, festive messiah, not the sword-piercing messiah (that prophecy in Luke 2:23 was probably still bothering her)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all need to be careful not to make God in our image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film series “The Chosen” takes the angle that Mary is not looking for personal glory but is merely trying to save her friend the public shame of running out of wine.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of Jesus reply being curt or disrespectful, the question is inquisitive, “why are you telling me this?” He then reiterates that it’s not the time for a public sign. To which Mary says “please…” – Jesus being Jesus figures out a way to honor His mother but have the sign kept quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I like about this portrayal is that it challenges the common narrative that Jesus was being rude. It gives us another way to look at the story – as long as it is still faithful to the Bible I think we should get comfortable with holding a couple of open options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting that many of the earliest Jewish commentaries weren’t commentaries as we think of them but paraphrases that creatively add in details that are omitted by the text. For example, the Jewish targum on Genesis 1:2 reads, “And the earth was vacancy and desolation, solitary of the sons of men, and void of every animal; and darkness was upon the face of the abyss, and the Spirit of mercies from before the Lord breathed upon the face of the waters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While always need to make sure any paraphrase lines up with scripture, God did give us the gift of imagination. There’s a time and a place for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase the exchange:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary: They have no more wine. I know you are the promised Messiah who is supposed to bring in the endless supply of wine. So bring some now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus: What can I do about it now? The Messianic Era when the supply of wine will be inexhaustible has not yet come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary (undaunted and in faith): Do whatever He tells you.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it wasn’t His time, the wedding feast at Cana, carries prophetic anticipation to the ultimate wedding feast, the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-26-8&#34;&gt;John 2:6-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there were six stone water jars there for the Ioudaioi’s rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water.” And they filled them up to the brim. And he said to them, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.” So they took it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; refers not to a people but to proper religious procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another suggestion that John is explaining the situation for non-Jewish readers, but ones who were loosely familiar with the procedure (as he doesn’t go into great detail about the reason for the purification rite).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though John may have been written to non-Jewish Israelites such as Samaritans, Jesus is clear that the Jewish method is the correct one (“Salvation is of the Jews.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do learn a couple of things about the Ioudaioi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ioudiaoi were not necessarily limited to the geographic terrotiry of Jerusalem or even Judea. This is in Cana in Galilee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every reference to Ioudaioi is referring to the temple establishment; as is the case here, it could be followers of the Jewish system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the audience were Jews as say in Matthew’s gospel, this qualifier would have been entirely unnecessary; John apparently expects his audience to be with purification rituals, but not necessarily JEWISH purification rituals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the size of the “jars” – they are almost as big as wine barrels – a significant quantity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John doesn’t tend to use numbers and details by accident so there is likely some significance to the six stone jars used for ceremonial washing – unfortunately, what that symbolism might have been is lost on us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first of seven major miracles in John’s gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John is testifying that he was an eyewitness that creation submitted to Jesus’ authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The master of the feast was responsible for the details of the banquet freeing up the host to attend to his guests and the festivities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He pronounced the blessings over the food and wine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, the first blessing over the first cup of wine was called the kos habesorah – cup of the good news.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The blessing was to declare and certify the bride’s purity.&lt;/strong&gt; Wow. Let that sink in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also was tasked with controlling the flow of food and drink; thus he would have been responsible for running out of wine prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-29-10&#34;&gt;John 2:9-10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the master of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew, the master of the feast called the bridegroom and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the poor wine. But you have kept the good wine until now.””&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the story is very familiar to us, this was a very private miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener notes that drunkenness to be part of the celebration at Cana is unlikely and the wine was often diluted 2:1 or 3:1.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-211-12&#34;&gt;John 2:11-12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory. And his disciples believed in him. After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother and his brothers and his disciples, and they stayed there for a few days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 11 is our memory verse for this lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John gives us the reason for the wine miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Stern says, the reason is “to anchor the trust of his new talmidim in the glory of God as manifested through Him.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson began with Andrew proclaiming Jesus as the one Moses spoke of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses’ first miracle was water to blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ first miracle was water to wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is unlikely to be a coincidence (the rabbis say “coincidence is not a kosher word.”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We look forward to OUR great messianic wedding banquet where wine will flow in abundance and Jesus will proclaim the wedding blessings over His bride.&lt;/li&gt;
