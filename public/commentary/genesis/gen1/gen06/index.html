<p><strong>Read/hear the portions</strong>:
Genesis 6</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>
God instructs Noah—the 10th from Adam and the only righteous man in a world consumed by violence and corruption—to build a large wooden ark, coated within and without with pitch. God decrees that a great deluge will wipe out all life from the face of the earth; but the ark will float upon the water, sheltering Noah and his family, and two members (male and female) of each animal species (and 7 of the &ldquo;pure&rdquo; species).</p>

<p>A plain reading of the first four verses indicates that angelic beings, “sons of God,” descended to earth and had relations with human women, creating a half-breed race called the Nephilim.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Admittedly, this is bizarre to conceptualize and awkward to discuss in polite company.</p>

<p>Thus, several alternate theories have arisen in order to have the text mean anything other than what it actually says.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Peter, Jude, and likely all of the apostles, followed the plain text reading, which is also recorded in the book of 1 Enoch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nephilim means the fallen ones, as in fallen angels. Heiser covers this topic extensively in his book “The Unseen Realm.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Numbers 13:33 indicates the Nephilim were giants and Jewish tradition says they committed all types of violence and sexual abominations and even became cannibals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Greek the term is gigantes, which makes us think of “giants” but the root word is actually <em>gigas</em>, which means “earth-born.”</p>

<p>Paul (Romans 3:23) and John (1 John 1:8) teach that no one is sinless other than Jesus</p>

<p>The word for blameless denotes an animal that is acceptable for a sacrifice.</p>

<p>Here is the “walking with God” phrase again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our discipleship journey is this kind of walk, path, road, or way. Hence our name Talmidim Way: the goal is for us to Walk with God along the way of disciples following after Yeshua, our great teacher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lancaster writes, “Walking with God means keeping His commandments, but it also means enjoying His company.”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are three verses in the Torah that give us more clarity on walking with God.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Deuteronomy 8:6 - So you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God by walking in his ways and by fearing him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deuteronomy 10:12 - “And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deuteronomy 11:22 - For if you will be careful to do all this commandment that I command you to do, loving the LORD your God, walking in all his ways, and holding fast to him,</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>As talmidim, let’s glue ourselves to Yeshua and enjoy the walk.</p>

<p>The Hebrew word for violence here is “Hamas;” yes, as in the terrorists.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In its mildest form, it can mean “unjust gain.”</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The rabbis build on this to say that stealing of any amount is equivalent to physical violence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If one were to steal only a few dollars, who is to say that the victim might not have invested that sum enough to leave an inheritance for his children’s children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus Pliskin says, “We are forbidden to steal even small amounts.”<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> If it’s not yours, don’t take it.</p>

<p>God took no pleasure in what He was about to do. (Eze 33:11)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ultimately, the flood is a story of mercy. He didn’t wipe out the universe and start over; He took that which was broken and fixed it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This gets us to the Jewish concept of Tikkun Olam. That is Hebrew for fixing the (broken) world.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the modern sense, the term is often appropriated by left-leaning organizations; but in a Biblical sense, that is exactly what God is doing here and it’s exactly what Jesus did throughout His earthly ministry, including His death on the Cross.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tikkun Olam means restoring the world back to God’s original intent, culminating with the New Eden/New Jerusalem in Revelation 21-22.</p>

<p>Using a 25” cubit, the Ark could have been 625 feet long, 104 feet wide and 63 feet high, giving it a displacement of 65000 tons (the Titanic displaced 46,00 tons).<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>

<td>For behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life under heaven. Everything that is on the earth shall die. But I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you.</td>
<td><p>Mat 24:39-41 and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. [40] Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left.</p>
<p>Heb 11:7 By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household. By this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.</p></td>

<p>A popular end-times fiction series from the late 90s was called “Left Behind.” It imagined the world under the reign of the antichrist after all of the good Christians have been taken up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More often in the bible, it is the opposite. It is not the good who are taken. The evil are taken in judgment while the good are left behind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Flood, righteous Noah and his family are the ones “left behind.”</p>

<td>And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female. Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground, according to its kind, two of every sort shall come in to you to keep them alive. Also take with you every sort of food that is eaten, and store it up. It shall serve as food for you and for them.” Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him.</td>
<td>Isa 11:1,6 There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit… The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat, and the calf and the lion and the fattened calf together; and a little child shall lead them.</td>

<p>Most know the story of Noah’s Ark even if they are not Christian or Jewish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Almost all of the ancient civilizations tell of a time long ago when the gods got so angry, they flood the earth to wipe out humanity except for a man and a woman who are left to repopulate the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In our children’s stories, we often picture a boat overflowing with animals and the giraffe is always sticking his head out of the roof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Flood is not a harmless children’s story – life was brought to the point of near extinction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will see a footnote later that there are seven of every clean animal, which begs the question, “how did Noah know which animals were clean?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That all of the animals were made to live peaceably, including we presume natural predators of other animals, speaks of the shalom of the messianic age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A traditional Jewish Rabbi said of that era: “There will be neither famine nor war, neither envy nor competition, for good things will flow in abundance.”<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>

<p>The wicked versus the righteous.</p>
<p>Pro 15:8-10</p>
<p>The sacrifice of the wicked (Cain) is an abomination to the LORD,</p>
<p>but the prayer of the upright (Noah) is acceptable to him.</p>
<p>The way of the wicked (Cain) is an abomination to the LORD,</p>
<p>but he loves him (Noah) who pursues righteousness.</p>
<p>There is severe discipline for him (Cain) who forsakes the way;</p>
<p>whoever hates reproof will die.</p>
