&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sons-of-abraham&#34;&gt;Sons of Abraham&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the Bible will be focused on Abraham and his descendants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish people are Abraham’s legal descendants while the disciples of Jesus are Abraham’s spiritual descendants by faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul, in various places, confirms that, through Jesus, gentile disciples can rightly refer to him as “Abraham, our father.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as it is true that not all biological descendants of Abraham (such as Ishmaelites and Edomites) can claim the promises, not all Gentiles and even not all gentiles who profess a belief in Jesus can make this claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster: “The critical paternity test is this question: ‘Are you walking in the footsteps of Abraham’s faith?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“(The &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi)&lt;/em&gt; answered him, “Abraham is our father.” Jesus said to them, “If you were Abraham&amp;rsquo;s children, you would be doing the works Abraham did” (John 8:39).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement is true of Christians who claim spiritual inheritance as much as it is of Jews who claim physical inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what were the works of Abraham?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages list 10 specific trials of Abraham; some he passed and some he failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ten Tests of Abraham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call from his homeland&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The famine in Canaan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abduction of Sarah in Egypt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The war with the four kings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wait for a son and his marriage to Hagar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circumcision&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abduction of Sarah by Abimelech&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Exile of Hagar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Exile of Ishmael&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sacrifice of Isaac&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, Abraham stood against idolatry and was willing to sacrifice his life for his convictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believers are to emulate Abraham where he succeeded and learn from Abraham where he failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let us study Abraham with a view toward strengthening our personal discipleship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Schlegel notes, our faith is founded on events that took place in time and space (history and geography).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:5.02153in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This map from the Moody Bible Atlas&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; shows the suggested route of Abram from Haran to Damascus: (blue line). Eliezer and Jacob would have followed the same roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;to-shechem&#34;&gt;To Shechem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.png&#34; style=&#34;width:5.44444in;height:5.36111in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Moody Bible Atlas map&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; shows the suggested route (solid green line) through Damascus. Abram possibly acquired the servant Eleazar at this time. Eleazar will be a pivotal supporting character in the story of Abram. As Abram’s eldest servant, he stood to inherit Abram’s estate if Abram had no natural offspring. Eleazar means God’s Helper and in many ways, we will see he is a biblical type of the Holy Spirit, especially in Genesis 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.27986in;height:9in&#34; /&gt;This Satellite Bible Atlas map&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; shows the journey to Shechem, through the center of the country to the Negev, and then eventually to Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Shechem, then Bethel (Luz) and Ai, then Negev&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We don’t know exactly how he got to Shechem, but the Wadi Far’a is a good inland road from the Jordan valley.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God visits Abram and promises inheritance to Abram’s seed and Abram builds an altar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He next moves to an area between Bethel and Ai.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ai is familiar to those who have studied Joshua as the place where the Israelites were defeated because there was “sin in the camp” – the lesson is that we are all in a community – when one member sins, we all sin and suffer the consequences. We usually think of our faith as individualistic. My business is between God and me; the Bible teaches both individual and corporate/community accountability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He then moved further south to the Negev past Hebron&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Egypt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abram has gained great wealth but appears to show a lack of faith (we note that it is commonly taught he shows a lack of faith but the text doesn’t say this so we need to be careful with our assumptions).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Egypt is generally viewed as a type of the world with its enticements and trappings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He places his wife in harm’s way while he accumulates more possessions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Later we will learn that Abram picked up a concubine named Hagar who would ensnare him with Ishmael as a false substitute for God’s promises&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can’t fault Abram for this – he is a picture of us when we try to help God along. This is something the enemy tempts us with every day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God’s promises are unconditional and will be fulfilled despite Abram’s failure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-121-5--god-calls-abram-to-canaan&#34;&gt;Genesis 12:1-5 – God calls Abram to Canaan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Now the LORD said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father&amp;rsquo;s house to the land that I will show you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great so that you will be a blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you, all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a spectacular blessing of which you and I are the beneficiaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note there are seven distinct promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul says the promises to Abraham are also given to Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, “And to offsprings,” referring to many, but referring to one, “And to your offspring,” who is Christ” (Gal 3:16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great nation – Galatians 3:29 And if you are Christ&amp;rsquo;s, then you are Abraham&amp;rsquo;s offspring, heirs according to promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessings Bestowed - Ephesians 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Great Name - Philippians 2:9-10 Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessings to others - Galatians 3:14 so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessings returned - Matthew 25:34 Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. (those things done for the least of these are done unto Him).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curses returned - Matthew 25:41 “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.’ (those things not done to the least of these were not done unto Him.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the families of the earth –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 3:25 You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 3:8 And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you shall all the nations be blessed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leaving his father’s house, Abram would be forfeiting his earthly inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this as, for the next couple of decades, Abram is childless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the back of his mind, he could have been thinking about what he could have had if he’d stayed put, versus the seemingly unfulfilled promise from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton: “When Abram gave up his place in his father’s household, he forfeited his security. He was putting his survival, his identity, his future, and his security in the hands of the LORD.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God calls us just as he did Abram. Like He does with us, He only asks us to take the next step in obedience (he won’t tell us the whole plan, or we might say no).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going” (Hebrews 11:8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone in the world at that time practiced idolatry. In what I believe is a model of our salvation process, God selected Abram, then he called Abram. Abram did nothing to merit the selection but he did have the free will to reject God’s call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 So Abram went, as the LORD had told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we noted last time, Acts 7 tells us the command from God came when Abram was in Ur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Abram sojourned in Haran suggests a lack of faith on his part;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 12:4 thus can be interpreted that God had to remind Abraham a second time of the promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can be thankful that God doesn’t give up on us when we stumble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother&amp;rsquo;s son, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people that they had acquired in Haran, and they set out to go to the land of Canaan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that Abraham is the first Hebrew because he is the first to come across (heb. &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;עבר&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ever)&lt;/em&gt; the Euphrates River. This is in addition to having a relative by the name of Eber&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 7:4-5 Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And after his father died, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living. Yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot&amp;rsquo;s length, but promised to give it to him as a possession and to his offspring after him, though he had no child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two contrasting ways to view the phrase “people that they had acquired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can literally translate as “souls they had made.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this, the sages depict Abraham as a missionary for monotheism, converting people from idolatry to the knowledge of the one true God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view is intriguing since for most of its history, Judaism has never been a proselytizing religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at it is that Abraham accumulated things and people of the world that serve to corrupt him&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we study Abram, we need to note the times when he is where he is supposed to be and those times when he is not where he is supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever he is not where he is supposed to be, Abram acquires people from that place he’s not supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Haran it was Lot and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Egypt, we will see Abram acquires a handmaid by the name of Hagar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Lot and Hagar will be sources of grief for Abram down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IHD: Both interpretations, even though they are opposite viewpoints, demonstrate the biblical theme of sowing and reaping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 6:7-8 Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap. For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we plant seeds in a place we’re not supposed to be, we shouldn’t be surprised at the consequences – we’ll touch on this again when we get to the story of Abraham and Hagar. Abraham acted in the flesh and there are consequences of his action to this day; but we could go back further and say the problem started when he went to Egypt and acquired Hagar in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, If we plant healthy seeds in others, eventually there will be a harvest – we may not see much fruit but our job is to plant, not to grow the tree. I can’t make a tree grow, I don’t know about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-126-9-in-canaan-the-lord-appears-again&#34;&gt;Genesis 12:6-9– in Canaan, the LORD appears again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 (When they came to the land of Canaan,) Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The honor of being the first city in Israel named in the Bible goes to Shechem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shechem has a mixed history and will ultimately be a source of grief for those who want to follow the One True God. We’ll explore this more a bit later in Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shechem lies in a valley surrounded by two mountains (hills): Mt. Gerizim and Mt. Ebal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It strategically lies at an interchange of the N-S way of the patriarchs and an E-W road, which helped it grow as a center of trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Israelites were about to go into the promised land, Moses instructed Joshua to station the tribes along the two hills. The blessings from the law were to be read from Mt. Gerizim and the cursings were to be read from Mt. Ebal. See Deuteronomy 28.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shechem is in the general vicinity of Jacob’s Well, which is the setting for the meeting between Jesus and the Samaritan Woman in John 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the woman says, “we Samaritans worship on this mountain,” she is referring to Mt. Gerizim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the Palestinian city of Nablus is adjacent to ancient Shechem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram is often associated with trees. Later we will see Abram by the Oaks of Mamre, which is further south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trees, especially large ones, were often thought to be prime teaching or studying locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically, this is because of the shade from the heat that the leaves provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symbolically, the tree representing knowledge is linked to the tree of knowledge back in Eden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trees, which tend to be somewhat phallic-shaped are symbolic of fertility and became adopted as places of worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 Then the LORD appeared to Abram and said, “To your offspring I will give this land.” So he built there an altar to the LORD, who had appeared to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 From there he moved to the hill country on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. And there he built an altar to the LORD and called upon the name of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram, an old man, had no seed at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, these altars are to a God, who would have been entirely unknown to the Canaanites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the text won’t always tell us so, it is a safe assumption that Abram built altars only when the LORD directed him to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ordinary places became holy to Abraham.” Lancaster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word for tent has a feminine suffix so it literally says, “He pitched her tent.” The Midrash comments that Abraham pitched Sarah’s tent first, then his own, which gives us men the reminder that we take care of her needs before ours. This is something that Abram will fail to do in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bethel is being used anachronistically here (technically, the $10 word is proleptic; something done in anticipation). Bethel won’t be called Bethel until Genesis 28:19. At this time of Abram, it would have been called Luz.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Istanbul, not Constantinople.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 And Abram journeyed on, still going toward the Negeb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Negev region of southern Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He would have passed through the cities that would later be known as Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and Hebron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1210-13--flight-to-egypt-deceiving-pharaoh&#34;&gt;Genesis 12:10-13 – Flight to Egypt, deceiving Pharaoh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lest we miss it, God told Abram to go to a land that GOD will show Abram. In verse 7, God says “THIS is the land.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, he departs for Egypt; there is no mention of building an altar and no mention that God told him to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s as if God showed Abram the promise and Abram said “thanks, I’ll take it from here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds a lot like something the person I look at in the mirror every day would do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is difficult to trust God when we think we can come up with a better plan of our own.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also if we look at it from Abram’s perspective, the so-called promised land is filled with wicked Canaanites and now there is no water, which led to a severe famine. In his mind, he had to pack up and head elsewhere to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Egypt, the Nile’s constant waters and predictable flood stages made that land impervious to famine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “I know that you are a woman beautiful in appearance,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they will kill me, but they will let you live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 Say you are my sister, that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared for your sake.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham was not necessarily a great role model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My life will be spared&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Abram concluded that, like David did with Uriah, a husband can be eliminated. A brother can be negotiated with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After they use the same tactic with Abimelech, Genesis 20:13 tells us that Abram and Sarai agreed to use this ruse way back in Mesopotamia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model will be repeated a third time with Isaac and Rebecca in Genesis 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, his life WAS spared, just as the Nation was spared after it fled to Egypt, just as the Messiah was spared after He fled to Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plagues came upon Pharaoh who let Sarai go just as plagues would come upon a different Pharaoh, who, reluctantly, would let the nation go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could take a lot of different angles here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wasn’t where he was supposed to be; so now he has to make a second bad decision as a result of his earlier bad decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is supposed to be the protector of his wife, but instead, he places her in harm’s way, while seeking to increase his financial position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He technically wasn’t fully lying. Genesis 20:12 tells us that Sarai was Abram’s ½ sister, the daughter of Terah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible is not shy about showing us the failures of its heros&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah, around 70, was a striking woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1214-16--sarai-taken-by-pharaoh&#34;&gt;Genesis 12:14-16 – Sarai taken by Pharaoh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 And when the princes of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier he said the ruse was so that “it may go well with me because of you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram got what he wanted apparently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1217-20-pharaoh-smitten-with-plagues&#34;&gt;Genesis 12:17-20 Pharaoh smitten with plagues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17 But the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram&amp;rsquo;s wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18 So Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19 Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her, and go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 And Pharaoh gave men orders concerning him, and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sudden outbreak of disease like this would have been assumed to be a divine curse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can imagine the pharaoh consulting with his magicians and them quickly determining it must have something to do with the new girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God takes marriage very seriously even when we don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can infer that God made the relationship between Sarai and Abram clear to Pharaoh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plague prevented Pharaoh from committing a greater sin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get much more information in Genesis 20, when Abraham will use the same approach with Abimelech, King of Gerar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham left Egypt a much wealthier man than when he entered, but there is a catch to everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we said in the introduction, included in the group of female servants was a handmaid named Hagar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;genesis-13&#34;&gt;Genesis 13&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 13 begins with Abraham returning to Bethel/Ai, where Abraham again worships the LORD at the altar he made previously. This is represented by the blue arrow pointing up to Bethel on the map.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this region, the Canaanites were the primary inhabitants of the land, yet Abram and Lot both had accumulated large herds that needed food and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two camps got into a turf battle, leading Abram to suggest the two separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram selflessly elects to defer to Lot, who lifts his eyes towards Sodom and departs. Lot’s movements are represented by the orange arrow and box #3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God honors Abram’s handling of this situation by reaffirming his promise. Abram then moves south to dwell in Hebron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:4.76449in;height:4.35019in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;genesis-14&#34;&gt;Genesis 14&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five kings of Canaan evidently violate a Suzerain-Vassel relationship, which leads to four kings of Mesopotamia moving into the Promised land to make war. We’ll describe what a Suzerain-Vassal treaty is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown on the map,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the kings move from north to south along the King’s Highway and are victorious over the Rephaim, Zuzim, Emim (two possible locations), and the Horites in the region of Sier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this leads up to the main narrative that as the Mesopotamians are plundering the region, they capture Lot with the intention of deporting him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram is Lot’s kinsman redeemer and thus is obligated to rescue him, which he does way up in the region of Dan (off the map to the north).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his return from rescuing Lot, on his way back to Hebron, Abram meets Melchi-zedek (King of Righteousness) at Salem (Jerusalem).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.27986in;height:9in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-131-4&#34;&gt;Genesis 13:1-4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negeb. Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. And he journeyed on from the Negeb as far as Bethel to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, to the place where he had made an altar at the first. And there Abram called upon the name of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we are reminded that in Genesis 12:1, Abram was supposed to go from his kindred and his father’s house. He certainly had other humans besides his wife with him but the Bible specifically tells us Lot was one of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word for “rich” in Hebrew (&lt;em&gt;caveyd, &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;כָּבֵד&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; literally means to “be weighty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Livestock, silver, and gold weigh quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a hint that riches can weigh us down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would have been around 200 miles but it was a very slow journey; if nothing else the livestock would need time to pasture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to Abram’s next test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-135-7-abrams-and-lots-men-quarrel&#34;&gt;Genesis 13:5-7: Abram’s and Lot’s men quarrel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents, so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together, and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram&amp;rsquo;s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot&amp;rsquo;s livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between April and October, rain is almost non-existent in most parts of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible also reminds us that the land Abram and Lot were in is not their own. Those wicked Canaanites, whom Noah cursed back in Genesis 9 are the primary residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not too hard to envision them tripping over each other trying to find the scarce fields and streams for their animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past 4000 years, the main source of contention in the Holy Land is water rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often think that more money is the answer, but “will you notice”…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible clearly links their large quantity of posessions with the interpersonal strife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know what happens to most Lottery jackpot winners, you probably wouldn’t wish that on your worst enemy, let alone wish it would happen to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-2&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-3&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-138-9-abram-and-lot-separate&#34;&gt;Genesis 13:8-9: Abram and Lot Separate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abram said to Lot, “Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are kinsmen. Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram passes this mini test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His age and status give him the first choice; the natural response would be to assert that right and take the best land for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram shows faith in God by letting Lot go first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, we should put others first and rely on God to meet our needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster: “Peace between brothers is more important than success or prestige.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-4&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-5&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1310-11&#34;&gt;Genesis 13:10-11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar. (This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan Valley, and Lot journeyed east. Thus they separated from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We again see the sin progression from Genesis 3 with the serpent and Eve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lot saw, he wanted, he took.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, practically, the Jordan may have been the only water around. In fact, it was like the garden of Eden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible is conspicuous that faith comes by hearing. People hear the word of the Lord and very few saw the Lord personally with their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John 20:29 Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How often do we make decisions based on what we see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cars, houses, investments, food?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we see should be part of the decision-making process; not the entirety of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-6&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-7&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1312-13&#34;&gt;Genesis 13:12-13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom. Now the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram remains in the land of Canaan where God told him to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s bad enough that Lot found Sodom appealing, but he subjects his family to that environment. We’re going to see in a few chapters an example of sowing and reaping. His daughters are not going to turn out to be model citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As parents, and especially fathers, we’re responsible for the environment we expose to our children. I’m thinking specifically about government schools that don’t simply teach things differently than how you would want them; if you are a Bible-believing parent with traditional values, you are their enemy and they are your enemy. You’re leaving your kids with your enemy for 8 hours a day. You’re dropping your kids off at Sodom Jr. High. It’s something to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you and I interact with biblical characters, we should ask ourselves how are we like Abraham and how are we like Lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lot is portrayed as selfish, worldly. He makes bad decision after bad decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, we will see in Chapter 14, that his redeemer pursues him when he is in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after this redemption, he makes more bad decisions and moves BACK to Sodom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately Lot is declared “righteous.” I would say this is true not because of who Lot was, but because of who Lot associated with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-9&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1314-16&#34;&gt;Genesis 13:14-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, “Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward, for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever. I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God blesses Abram’s passing of the test by reconfirming the covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He chose to elevate his neighbor over his personal prosperity. At its core, this is the definition of honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, God blessed Him with BOTH peace and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a further illustration, Lot acted selfishly and chose what appealed to the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a few chapters that prized location will be destroyed and turned into the wasteland we see today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this illustrates Jesus’ words: Matthew 25:29 “For to everyone who has (i.e., a heart for God like Abram) will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not (i.e., a selfish heart like Lot), even what he has will be taken away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t know how much time has passed since Genesis 12:3 but safe to say several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram may be wondering about that “offspring” thing since he is still childless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see this as God telling him to hang in there, continue to be faithful and wait on God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Abraham’s ultimate offspring is Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Galatians 3:16 Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, “And to offsprings,” referring to many, but referring to one, “And to your offspring,” who is Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-10&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-11&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1317-18&#34;&gt;Genesis 13:17-18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arise, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.” So Abram moved his tent and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron, and there he built an altar to the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In faithfulness, Abram builds an altar. We can tell when he’s passed a test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebron is about halfway between Jerusalem and Beersheba; it’s only 19 miles from Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram will later be buried in Hebron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-12&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-13&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-141-4&#34;&gt;Genesis 14:1-4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, these kings made war with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar). And all these joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea). Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to admit that there is no extra-biblical support for this passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, there is no record that the four kings of the east had any control over the Holy Land during the early 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; millennium BC at the time of Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean the Bible is wrong; in fact, it is more likely that there are gaps in our knowledge of the history of this period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, what is being described is a suzerain-vassal relationship, which is entirely consistent with how things worked in ancient society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s basically a protection racket&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A weaker king (the vassal) pays tribute to a stronger king (the suzerain) in exchange for protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then what would happen is a third party make a threat. The vassal would threaten to call the suzrain, but the new guy says, “pay me tribute then I’ll protect you from the other guy when he comes to collect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also was not uncommon for the vassal to get tired of the whole arrangement and rebel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was very common for the suzrain to not take it well whenever the vassal revolted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim, and the Horites in their hill country of Seir as far as El-paran on the border of the wilderness. Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh) and defeated all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who were dwelling in Hazazon-tamar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible loves geography: they’re following the King’s Highway in Jordan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the land of the giants (Rephaim), so there may be more going on here than we realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deuteronomy 2:20-21 (It is also counted as a land of Rephaim. Rephaim formerly lived there—but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim— [21] a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim; but the LORD destroyed them before the Ammonites, and they dispossessed them and settled in their place. (Read all of Deuteronomy 2).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-16&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-17&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-148-11-the-babylonians-are-victorious&#34;&gt;Genesis 14:8-11: the Babylonians are victorious&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out, and they joined battle in the Valley of Siddim with Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar, four kings against five. Now the Valley of Siddim was full of bitumen pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them, and the rest fled to the hill country. So the enemy took all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is often called “Four Kings against Five Kings”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four Mesopotamian kings won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t think tar pits like Californians have in La Brea, a lake of sticky muck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally occurring bitumen in this region is solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pits here are more like wells, or maybe even more like mine shafts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They didn’t fall in and get stuck; the locals needed a place to hide and they knew where to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four kings routed then plundered, including deporting the population, which is a foreshadowing of the Babylonian captivity in 586 BCE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the captives was Lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-18&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-19&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1412-13-the-babylonians-take-lot-into-captivity&#34;&gt;Genesis 14:12-13: The Babylonians take Lot into captivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also took Lot, the son of Abram&amp;rsquo;s brother, who was dwelling in Sodom, and his possessions, and went their way. Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew, who was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and of Aner. These were allies of Abram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first mention of Hebrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think of the term in terms of ethnicity or religion, but Walton points out, at this time it may have been a “designation of a social class.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, it certainly could have referenced the fact that Abram and his family were not polytheistic like everyone else around them, but were worshippers of the One who will be known as the “God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1414-17-abram-rescues-lot&#34;&gt;Genesis 14:14-17: Abram rescues Lot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, 318 of them, and went in pursuit as far as Dan. And he divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and defeated them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus. Then he brought back all the possessions, and also brought back his kinsman Lot with his possessions, and the women and the people. After his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King&amp;rsquo;s Valley).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to think of “next of kin” as someone younger, but in this context, Abram was Lot’s next of kin. That means Abram, as lot’s redeemer, wasn’t just being nice; Abram had an obligation to go after Lot and rescue him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does Jesus as our Kinsman Redeemer, have an obligation to pursue us who are lost? I think He sees it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw in Revelation how there is a point where God seems to say “if you mess with My people then you’re messing with Me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine being in enemy captivity but not wanting to be rescued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the sad state of the unbeliever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Enemy knows that the best kind of enslaved person is one who doesn’t know he’s enslaved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any aspects of our lives where we are enslaved but don’t view it that way? (hurts, habits, hangups, false dichotomies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to get in the habit of viewing life through a spiritual lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that respect, the abduction of Lot is a satanic attack on the Messianic line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lot is the father of the Ammonites and the Moabites&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naamah, the Ammonite is listed as the mother of Rehoboam (2 Kings 12:12) and, more famously, Ruth, is the mother of Obed (Matthew 1:5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As both Obed and Rehoboam are in the Messianic line, Jesus has Moabite and Ammonite lineage – an attack on Lot puts that in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is everywhere in the Old Testament if you know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a sense of how wealthy Abram had become, we are told he has a security detail of 318 men; potentially the same size as the armies of each of the city-states named (but likely much inferior to the size of the combined armies of the Mesopotamian kings)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like Gideon, Abram used the tactic of dividing his already small forces in a nighttime ambush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan in this case is being used anachronistically (since Dan has not been born yet); this refers to the extreme north of the Promised Land, again up near Mt. Hermon where the demonic activity occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it’s the same location as mentioned in 2 Sam 18:18, the King’s valley is where the Kidron and the Hinnom valleys come together in Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Samuel 18:18 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself the pillar that is in the King&amp;rsquo;s Valley, for he said, “I have no son to keep my name in remembrance.” He called the pillar after his own name, and it is called Absalom&amp;rsquo;s monument to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an “Absalom’s pillar” today that dates to the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century CE, but this is not to say it couldn’t have been built over the original site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-his-dust&#34;&gt;In His Dust:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disciples do all we can to save someone in trouble.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-20&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James 4:17 So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though Lot had only himself to blame for his situation, Abraham did all he could to save him.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-21&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1418-20-melchizedek-and-abram-have-a-banquet&#34;&gt;Genesis 14:18-20: Melchizedek and Abram have a banquet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. (He was priest of God Most High.) And he blessed him and said, “Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth; and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand!” And Abram gave him a tenth of everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton speculates that Melchizedek might have been the principal king of the region. Salem is usually considered to be Jerusalem, which would make this the first reference to Jerusalem in Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psalms 76:2 His abode has been established in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“God Most High” (El Alyon) is not necessarily Our God, but is probably El, the chief Canaanite god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elements of communion get our attention. In context, the shared meal likely signifies Melchizedek’s desire to make peace with Abram and his formidable army. Abram in turn acknowledges Melchizedek’s status by paying tribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This foreshadows the Messianic banquet when we too will dine at the table with Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 8:11 I tell you, many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know almost nothing about Melchizedek (King of Righteousness); and we probably would not remember his name if it were not for Psalm 110 and Hebrews 5-7, particularly chapter 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psalms 110:4 The LORD has sworn and will not change his mind, “You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews presents a complicated distinction between a priest of Levi and a priest in the order of Melchizedek (who is both a king and a priest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Israelites offer tithes and bow to Levi/the Aaronic priesthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham could not bow down to a Levite because Levi was still in Abraham’s loins (that’s what Hebrews says!), but he could bow down to Melchizedek&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the logic, the priesthood of Melchizedek is superior to the priesthood of Aaron. Messiah belongs to a different priesthood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus does not cancel or abolish the Aaronic priesthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He merely operates in a different realm (for example, not the earthly Temple but the heavenly Temple).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the writer to Hebrews says Melchizedek is a type of Jesus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalms 110:4 says a priest in the order of Melchizedek, not “the priest Melchizedek.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 7:3 He is without father or mother or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God he continues a priest forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melchizedek was not a supernatural apparition, but no such lineage is documented. Therefore he is a type of Jesus who existed at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the Levitical priesthood, Melchizedek represents the Messianic priesthood during the Messianic era of peace (shalom/Salem), ruling from Jerusalem.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham tithes before it was mandated later in Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham tithed because it pleased God, not because it was something he was required to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also expected nothing in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another way of saying, Abraham didn’t tithe to be saved; he tithed because he already was saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-22&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-23&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1421-the-king-of-sodom-vs-king-of-salem&#34;&gt;Genesis 14:21: The King of Sodom vs. King of Salem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The King of Sodom might be thought of as an “anti-Melchizedek.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it is clear that the Divine Narrator wants us to connect Melchizidek with the King of Sodom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Melchizedek is a type of Messiah, then the King of Sodom is a type of the Anti-messiah; otherwise known as Antichrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note we have “Jerusalem” (holy city) versus “Sodom” (wicked city)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He shows up here requesting the souls of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1422-24-abram-declines-spoils-of-war&#34;&gt;Genesis 14:22-24: Abram declines spoils of war&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have lifted my hand to the LORD, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth, that I would not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that is yours, lest you should say, ‘I have made Abram rich.’ I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me. Let Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre take their share.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is often the case, when we have a spiritual success, we are often tempted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham, who willingly gave a 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; to Melchizedek, the King of Jerusalem, refuses to give anything to the King of Sodom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram is a representative of the LORD, God Most High, and will not profit from his military action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was likely a written agreement between Abram and the King of Sodom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Genesis chapter 14 may be the text of that agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hebrews-7&#34;&gt;Hebrews 7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, and to him Abraham apportioned a tenth part of everything. He is first, by translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of Salem, that is, king of peace. He is without father or mother or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God he continues a priest forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See how great this man was to whom Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth of the spoils! And those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take tithes from the people, that is, from their brothers, though these also are descended from Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this man who does not have his descent from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior. In one case tithes are received by mortal men, but in the other case, by one of whom it is testified that he lives. One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham, for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him. Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, rather than one named after the order of Aaron?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well. For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar. For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This becomes even more evident when another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek, who has become a priest, not on the basis of a legal requirement concerning bodily descent, but by the power of an indestructible life. For it is witnessed of him, “You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.” For on the one hand, a former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness (for the law made nothing perfect); but on the other hand, a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God. And it was not without an oath. For those who formerly became priests were made such without an oath, but this one was made a priest with an oath by the one who said to him: “The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, ‘You are a priest forever.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes Jesus the guarantor of a better covenant. The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office, but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them. For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. He has no need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily, first for his own sins and then for those of the people, since he did this once for all when he offered up himself. For the law appoints men in their weakness as high priests, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;genesis-15--a-faith-completed-by-works-james-222&#34;&gt;Genesis 15 – A faith completed by works (James 2:22)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geographic setting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:5.26806in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t provided a specific location for the events in this chapter. Verse 15 references Abraham buried, which we know is Hebron, SW of Jerusalem and Bethlehem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;faith-alone&#34;&gt;Faith Alone?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15 is an important chapter to the Apostolic Writers. Verse 6 contains the famous statement, “He (Abraham) believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This verse is directly referenced in Romans 4, Galatians 3, Hebrews 11, and James 2. This verse, along with Habakkuk 2:4, “The just shall live by faith,” are the verses that sparked the Reformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul spends an entire chapter, Romans 4, developing Abraham’s faith, and, as a compliment, James spends half of chapter two doing the same, but in a slightly different context. The famous “faith without works is dead” passage uses Abraham in Genesis 15 as a backdrop. So we’re going to need to be Bereans (Acts 17;11) and do our homework to piece all of this together to make sure we have a firm grasp of how faith and works go together. This is important because, in my humble opinion, the protestant church has largely gotten it wrong for the past 500 years by teaching “Faith Alone.” That’s not exactly what the Bible teaches. Jesus never says our works don’t matter; in fact, there are multiple passages where He essentially says, “if you love me, you will keep my commands.” (John 14:15, 14:24, 15:10, Mat 28:20, etc.). But as always, don’t believe what I say. Be a Berean and check it out for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is true is the order. Faith comes first, then obedience. We’ll see Abraham’s faith here in Chapter 15, and then we’ll see his obedience, culminating with obedience beyond all understanding in Genesis 22. God delivered the Israelites from Egypt first, then gave them the Torah, the standards of ethical behavior for His people. Jesus first says come to Me you who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest” (Mat 11:28), then he says, “(teach) them to obey all I have commanded” (Mat 28:20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be worth our time to read Romans 4 and James 2:14-26 in conjunction with Genesis 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told, Abraham occurs 75 times in the New Testament, and the events in His life that are referenced the most begin in this chapter. A firm understanding of Chapters 15, 16, 17, 21, and 22 will significantly aid our correct interpretation and application of New Testament teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-151-3&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:1-3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these things, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: “Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.” But Abram said, “O Lord GOD, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?” And Abram said, “Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God communicates in visions. They are distinct from dreams in that the recipient has no doubt the conversation really took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we remember, the chapter and verse breaks are man’s insertions; they are not divinely inspired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are used to “after these things” denoting a scene shift, but this is not to say the events after these things are not related to the events before “these things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we read the Story of Abraham as a continuous narrative, Abraham has just given 10% to Melchizedek and did not keep any spoils for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God viewed this with favor and here says, “because you refused reward from the King of Sodom, your reward from Me will be very great.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham wants to know what has become of the promises of Chapter 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a man had no son, he could legally adopt a servant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite God’s earlier promise, Abraham seems resigned to this course of action, possibly believing that Eliezer is whom God had in mind to continue Abraham’s line all along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, since we know what is about to happen with Isaac, it’s easy for us to see a lack of faith, especially since God specifically said, “your offspring.” We, as disciples, often limit God to what we can see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How patient and faithful would WE be if we were in Abraham’s shoes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliezer means “God is Help” or “God’s helper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four times in John 15, Jesus refers to the Holy Spirit as “the Helper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John 15:26 “But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this discussion when we get to Genesis 24 when the father’s (unnamed) helper goes to fetch a bride for the son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-154-5&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:4-5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And behold, the word of the LORD came to him: “This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir.” And he brought him outside and said, “Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:12 Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as many as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God IS able to number them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalms 147:4 He determines the number of the stars; he gives to all of them their names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 40:26 Lift up your eyes on high and see: who created these? He who brings out their host by number, calling them all by name; by the greatness of his might and because he is strong in power, not one is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God and Abraham had a special relationship. They speak with each other as two friends. In a few chapters, they will negotiate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James 2:23 and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”—and he was called a friend of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-156&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he believed the LORD, and he counted it to him as righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement was very important to Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 4 is Paul’s commentary on Genesis 15:6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 4:13 For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul is saying that as believers, we are to trust in God just as Abraham did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Paul, Abraham didn’t just believe God would provide a literal son in Isaac; Abraham foresaw a special son of His: the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 8:56 “Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day. He saw it and was glad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 3:29 And if you are Christ&amp;rsquo;s, then you are Abraham&amp;rsquo;s offspring, heirs according to promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Paul’s logic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God promised Abraham a seed (seed singular, not seeds plural)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham believed God’s promise regarding the seed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Seed is the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore Abraham believed in the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul used this passage as a proof-text that Gentiles did not need to convert to Judaism to be deemed righteous by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proclamation of Abraham’s faith and declaration of his righteousness came before the covenant sign and commandment to Abraham to circumcise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are deemed righteous first, and then we obey; we don’t obey to attain righteousness. When we fail, we don’t lose our status; when we fail, we realize our dependence on God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is VERY different from saying “works don’t matter at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible doesn’t teach salvation by works; but, it does teach works from salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israelites were delivered from bondage, and THEN they were given the Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James 2:20-24 Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? [You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”—and he was called a friend of God. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One remarkable aspect about the Bible is it seems to anticipate false doctrine – and what is remarkable about man is that we still get it wrong (for example, Luther reportedly said he “had no use for James.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Faith alone” is a core teaching of the Protestant Church, yet it may only be ½ correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note James is not saying “works alone justify.” A person who claims to have faith but no works might be in error about his claim to have faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 3:5-7 Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith— just as Abraham “believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”? Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul makes it clear he is basing his arguments FROM the Torah, not outside of the Torah: Romans 3:31 Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-157-8&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:7-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he said to him, “I am the LORD who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.” But he said, “O Lord GOD, how am I to know that I shall possess it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We call this cognitive dissonance. Abraham’s reality doesn’t match what he believes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can simultaneously believe and doubt, as with the father of the demon-possessed boy in Mark 9:24: Immediately, the father of the child cried out and said, “I believe; help my unbelief!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the overarching test for believers. We believe God is all-good and we believe that God is all powerful, yet evil exists. The martyred saints struggled with this in Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Abraham’s case, God will address Abraham’s desire to “know that I shall possess” with a covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-159-10&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:9-10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” And he brought him all these, cut them in half, and laid each half over against the other. But he did not cut the birds in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This procedure signifies a covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, both parties would divide the sacrifices and then walk between them – we’re going to see something different about this treaty in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cutting in half is symbolic of the curse on the one who violates the treaty. The parties are essentially saying, “may I become like this animal if I break the treaty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parties share a fellowship meal – symbolic of mutual blessings for keeping to the terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1511&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for the Eagle, birds of prey are usually negative in the Bible, as Jesus describes in the Parable of the Four Soils:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 13:4 And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 13:19 When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a direct sense, Abraham is going to have to compete with the enemies listed at the end of the chapter for possession of the land. They have no part in the covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an indirect sense, the birds are the ministers of Satan, ready to attack and defile God’s covenants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Driving the birds away means we need to be vigilant about identifying threats – something Abraham will fail to do in Chapter 16.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1512-14&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:12-14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. And behold, dreadful and great darkness fell upon him. Then the LORD said to Abram, “Know for certain that your offspring will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs and will be servants there, and they will be afflicted for four hundred years. But I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward, they shall come out with great possessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;terrible-darkness&#34;&gt;Terrible darkness?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tradition holds that Abraham was given a vision of all of the suffering of the Jewish people, from Egypt to Auschwitz, but it culminated with a vision of the Messianic Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another possibility Jesus was referencing when He said, “Abraham rejoiced to see My day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;unconditional-covenant&#34;&gt;Unconditional Covenant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many catholic and protestant commentators don’t understand the significance of verse 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common strain of theology goes like this: “Israel forfeited God’s promises because she rejected her Messiah. Those promises now belong to the church.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham was not an active party to the covenant trust agreement – this covenant was UNCONDITIONAL. Abraham, or his offspring Israel, could not violate the terms of the agreement if they tried, including the national rejection of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promises are still in play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church does not replace Israel; the church has an entirely different mission and destiny from national (theological) Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: this does not mean we have to blindly support political Israel – that is a different discussion although eventually theological Israel and political Israel must intersect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMHO we need to get away from blanketly saying this or that group is all good or all bad. There are Good Jews and bad Jews. There are good Palestinians and bad Palestianians. There are Good Christians and bad people who call themselves Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Job is to be bereans and true to the Bible, because of that I can say “my God and my Savior loves Israel so I love Israel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sojourner---messiah&#34;&gt;Sojourner - Messiah&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word is ger, and it refers to something like a resident alien – separated from his own people, living among foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messiah has been a sojourner, a stranger to His own people, living among us gentiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, Messiah will no longer be a sojourner or a stranger and He will inherit everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;400-years&#34;&gt;400 Years?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 7:6 And God spoke to this effect—that his offspring would be sojourners in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and afflict them four hundred years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know 400 years does not refer to the time they were in Egypt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further complicate matters, Exodus 12:40 says they were in Egypt 430 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at the genealogies, only 64 years pass from the time Joseph dies to when Moses is born – Exodus 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to one reckoning, the 400 years of affliction begins when Ishmael mocks/persecutes Isaac in Genesis 21. Then using the ages given in the Bible, it is exactly 400 years until Moses speaks to Pharaoh in Exodus 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30 years before this is when God Gave the promise to Abraham we are studying here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds contrived, Paul evidently confirms the math in Galatians 3 by saying the Torah was given 430 years after the promise to Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 3:16-17 Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, “And to offsprings,” referring to many, but referring to one, “And to your offspring,” who is Christ. This is what I mean: the law, which came 430 years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our presuppositions is that God’s word is infallible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we think we’ve found an error, we are revealing that we don’t really believe Scripture is without error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better to ask, “since the Bible cannot be in error, how is my understanding in error?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1515-16&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:15-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age. And they shall come back here in the fourth generation, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to remember God’s ways our not our ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In part, the reason the Israelites were in Egypt was so the sin of the Amorites would be complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the reason we go through trials is so we can later glorify God through our testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1517--the-torch-is-messiah&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:17 – The Torch is Messiah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the sun had gone down and it was dark, behold, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a foreshadowing of God as the pillar of cloud/pillar of fire in the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 62:1 For Zion&amp;rsquo;s sake I will not keep silent, and for Jerusalem&amp;rsquo;s sake I will not be quiet, until her righteousness goes forth as brightness, and her salvation (Yeshua) as a burning torch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1518-21&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:18-21&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that day, the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your offspring, I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates, the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exodus 12:40-43 The time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt was 430 years. [41] At the end of 430 years, &lt;strong&gt;on that very day,&lt;/strong&gt; all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt&amp;hellip;And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the statute of the Passover…,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to our 400/430 year discussion – if we take Exodus 12 literally, then the day Abraham received this vision was the evening between Nissan 14 and 15; in other words, he received it on Passover (in advance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14/15 Nissan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham slaughtered the animals to make a covenant with the LORD in a great and terrible darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children of Israel slaughtered their Passover lambs in Egypt as the angel of death slew Egypt’s firstborn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messiah suffered and died as our sacrifice, right after He instituted a New Covenant. At sunset, they closed the Master’s tomb (another great and terrible darkness).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all three darkness times a light blazed forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster, “The day of Passover draws a line of connection from Abraham’s covenant to his singular promised Seed, the Messiah.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;opening-thoughts&#34;&gt;Opening thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham has several decision points in this chapter. As we work through, ask yourself what would you have done if you were Abraham and why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, while an in-depth study of the various issues Paul addresses in Galatians is beyond our scope, Paul will use Hagar versus Sarah and Ishmael vs Isaac as typological models. The greater our understanding of Genesis chapters 16-21, the better we will be able to follow Paul’s rather complex arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:3.68616in;height:5.28283in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schlaegel, author of the Satellite Bible Atlas writes, “Despite the promises made in chapter 15, in chapter 16, we see what can happen when we get impatient with God.  Abram went into Hagar and she became pregnant.  This lead to strife between Sarai and Hagar and Hagar decides to flee.  God tells her that Ishmael will be blessed (though he will be a &amp;ldquo;wild ass of a man&amp;rdquo;) and she should return.  We aren&amp;rsquo;t told exactly where this happens but it is along the &amp;ldquo;Way of Shur&amp;rdquo;”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-161-2&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:1-2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Sarai, Abram&amp;rsquo;s wife, had borne him no children. She had a female Egyptian servant whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said to Abram, “Behold now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Go in to my servant; it may be that I shall obtain children by her.” And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A maidservant was a legal extension of her owner, so legally and technically, the result of the procedure Sarai suggested would have counted as Sarai’s offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Sarai’s defense, she probably felt like the one who was responsible for the unfulfilled promise and she was well past child-bearing age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going in to someone who is not your wife sounds odd to us but Sarai’s logic is no different than adoption, where two surrogate parents were involved with the conception or artificial insemination where one surrogate parent is involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a way to build a family with natural methods fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Sarai showed a lack of faith – it is God’s prerogative to open closed wombs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this method was a reasonable option in that day, In Abrahams&amp;rsquo;s case it is different because he was given a specific promise by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many poor choices, this one “seemed like a good idea at the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whose voice SHOULD Abraham have been listening to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we doubt God and act in the flesh, we “sire an Ishmael.” How many of us have a lot of little Ishmaels running around?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a socially acceptable arrangement in the Ancient world, but I’m reminded of the phrase, “just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, God calls us to a higher standard than the society around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; major test, according to Maimonides, a traditional Jewish commentator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the test was the long wait for the birth of a promised son, not being presented with Hagar (but we can see how impatience results in more tests, and often more opportunities to fail those tests).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want a child, and now look. My wife gives me option B.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing really well in chapters 13-15, Abraham blows it on multiple levels here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wish we could have a solid trend of growth, like a chart that consistently goes “up and to the right,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our lives resemble a stock chart more than a trend line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up and down; a good quarter, followed by a not-so-good quarter, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t help seeing some parallels between Sarai and Eve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text doesn’t say that Satan prompted Sarai, but it is safe to say the decision was not from God, and at least in an indirect sense, her decision was from the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God spoke through Adam and Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan spoke through Eve and Sarai (if only indirectly)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam listened to Eve, when He knew what God has said about the Tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham listened to Sarai when he knew what God had said about offspring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last two chapters, the Divine Narrator wants us to know the geographic origin of the two servants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that wherever Abraham goes, he accumulates more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Haran, it was Lot; in Damascus, it was Eliezer; and in Egypt, it was Hagar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wasn’t supposed to be in Haran&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was told to leave his father’s country and his family and head to a place God showed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lot was a repeated source of grief for Abram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was in Damascus because he was doing a righteous deed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was Lot’s kinsman redeemer and went after a lost sheep just like our Kinsman Redeemer pursued us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliezer of Damascus was a source of blessing for Abraham, which we will see in Genesis 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was not supposed to be in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God showed him Canaan, not Egypt; going to Egypt demonstrated a lack of faith in God’s promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He accumulated Hagar, who will be a source of grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hagar’s offspring and Sarah’s offspring have been clashing ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust-1&#34;&gt;Walking in His Dust #1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talmidim demonstrate patience and self-control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gal 5:22-23&lt;/em&gt; But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, when God has given us a promise, we wait on Him&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goals and aspirations are great things if they are consistent with God’s purposes for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to be content to wait for Him to bring those purposes to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is something God has placed on our heart, getting out in front of Him will only mess it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one sense, it’s natural to ask, “is there something I’m missing? Something I’m not doing that I should be doing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If God opens a door, then I’ll go through; but I’m learning to be content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is there may be open doors that God hasn’t opened – that was Abraham’s test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We must make sure we’re only moving out when He says “move out.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-163&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram&amp;rsquo;s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, and gave her to Abram, her husband, as a wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hagar, now a concubine, was not a full-status wife, so in the ancient world, this would not be viewed as polygamy.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years had passed since Abraham first heard from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and I get impatient when we don’t hear from God right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to wait on God, but can be disastrous when we don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this comes an ancient tradition that after a woman has gone childless for 10 years, her husband is obligated to marry another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-164&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, we have a negative connotation of “mistress,” so this phrasing is easy to misinterpret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s NOT that Sarah looking with contempt on Hagar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the other way around; Hagar’s mistress, i.e. superior, is Sarah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might say Hagar was taking a victory lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a cultural context, she may have equated herself as a wife of equal standing with Sarai, when she wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was in a lower social order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is the first recorded love triangle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this included a threat that Hagar was not going to give her son to Sarai as per the arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition tells us what Hagar said: She said, “This Sarai… her conduct in secret is not like her conduct in public. She shows herself as if she is a righteous woman, but she is not a righteous woman, for she did not merit to conceive all these years, whereas I have conceived from the first union.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (Genesis Rabbah 45:3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, with seemingly fanciful interpretations like these, our western mind wants to ask, “is this really true?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably not, but that’s not the point. Pastors use illustrations in sermons today; I’m sure every one is not 100% historically accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fill in gaps with educated guesses and speculations; Jewish commentary practices allow for a lot more creativitiy than our seminaries do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-165-6&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:5-6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong done to me be on you! I gave my servant to your embrace, and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked on me with contempt. May the LORD judge between you and me!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Abram said to Sarai, “Behold, your servant is in your power; do to her as you please.” Then Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to say, “this was YOUR idea, Sarai!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see two sides to Abram’s response&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. He failed to lead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible paints a picture at the very beginning of the book that the husband/father is supposed to be the “CEO” of the family organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam and Eve – Adam let his wife make a bad decision without consulting him. Did they not foster mutual accountability in Eden?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah led his family on to the ark, but he didn’t lead once they were off the ark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, Abraham deferred to Sarai’s judgment twice (verse 2 and here at verse 6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham is the one who had the discussion with God, not Sarah. He needed to be more of a leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. If Hagar was acting like she was a full status wife, Abram affirming that Hagar is still Sarai’s subordinate. So potentially, in deferring to Sarai he didn’t make a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps both are true. A good Berean attempts to see more than one side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a theme that will repeat in literature of the lower-status person having more than the upper-class person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole drama of the Count of Monte Cristo is based on this theme (and also a love triangle).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowly Hagar had more than wealthy Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, in God’s economy, the first shall be last and the last shall be first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible says, this time, Hagar left and not that she was cast out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust-2&#34;&gt;Walking in His Dust #2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We must speak out in defense of someone who is being mistreated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish medieval sage Rashi accuses Abram of stealing from Sarai here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How? After he heard Hagar disgrace Sarah, he was silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you prayed to God, “What will You give me, since I am going childless?” you prayed only for yourself, whereas you should have prayed for both of us, and I would have been remembered with you. Moreover, you are stealing from me your [protective] words, for you hear my degradation, and you remain silent (i.e., you are depriving me of the words you should have spoken to Hagar to reprimand her on my behalf)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pliskin says, “if failure to defend another person’s honor is stealing, then we are obligated to speak up when we see someone being disgraced. Word of defense are due to a person being disgraced, and it is consideres stealing to withhold them.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philippians 2:3-4 Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. [4] Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-167-8&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:7-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur. And he said, “Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?” She said, “I am fleeing from my mistress Sarai.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first mention of “The angel of the LORD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, the word for a supernatural angel is the same for a natural human messenger, but we can safely assume the Messenger of the Lord is definitely supernatural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some speculate that the angel of the LORD is pre-incarnate Jesus. There are places where this could be the case, but others where it doesn’t seem to fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the messenger is an authorized representative of the LORD, he can use the first person “I.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The messenger is at the same time distinct and not distinct from the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a government ambassador representing his king, or a corporal reading a message from a general, the messenger’s words carry the same weight as if they came from the LORD Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the lines become so blurry that it would appear that God Himself and not His angel is speaking. We’ll see this in Chapter 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Angel reinforces Hagar’s subordinate position with respect to Sarai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hagar answers the first question but cannot answer the second. She’s headed back to Egypt (the way to Shur tells us this), but spiritually she doesn’t know where she’s going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her chances of making it alone and pregnant (i.e. she would be viewed as a woman with suspect morals) probably weren’t good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s curious that God intervenes to prevent her from leaving the promised land, yet He did not do that – but could have – when Abram went to Egypt. This is God’s sovereign choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-169-11&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:9-11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angel of the LORD said to her, “Return to your mistress and submit to her.” The angel of the LORD also said to her, “I will surely multiply your offspring so that they cannot be numbered for multitude.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the angel of the LORD said to her, “Behold, you are pregnant and shall bear a son. You shall call his name Ishmael, because the LORD has listened to your affliction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yishma = he will hear, or he hears + El = God hears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone who has read Moby Dick will recall the iconic opening line “Call me Ishmael,” suggesting the narrator’s wild wandering and affliction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael is indeed a great multitude today; he is the Arabic people, many of whom were the first gentile believers in Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arabic Christians in the middle east are among the most persecuted today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jews don’t like them because they’re Arabs, and Muslims don’t like them because they’re Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Return and submit” is a tough assignment, given what Hagar has just experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1612&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He shall be a wild donkey of a man, his hand against everyone and everyone&amp;rsquo;s hand against him, and he shall dwell over against all his kinsmen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, a very dark prophecy for the Ishmaelites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Arabic (which became Islamic) tradition, Ishmael is regarded as the forefather of the Arab people and the rightful heir of Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael founded the holy city of Mecca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham nearly offered Ishmael, not Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lines of Ishmael and Isaac’s son Esau become comingled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he consolidated power, Muhammed is said to have eliminated many of his kinsman and today, Muhammed’s historical legacy is that the Suni’s hand is against the Shi’ia and vice versa. The main disagreement is over which group is the purer followers of Muhammed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is interesting is prior to the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, Jews and Muslims relations were not all that bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jews existed relatively comfortably in Islamic countries, including in the Ottoman empire. Egypt and Iran traditionally had thriving Jewish populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Israel/Palestine, Muslims generally venerated and protected Jewish holy sites such as tombs of the prophets and patriarchs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the Christian nations who were traditionally awful to the Jews with the inquisition, the pogroms, and of course the Holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After WWI, Britain and France began to muck around and redraw maps, and Jews began moving back into the Holy Land; that’s when Arab-Israeli conflicts began in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we need to be careful - this verse has been used to disparage all Arabs and Muslims. That’s called racism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our sin nature, ALL of our hands are against each other. We are only changed by the gift of a changed heart that comes through faith in Messiah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jer 17:9 “The heart is more deceitful than all else And is desperately sick; Who can understand it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen 6:5 Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of mankind was great on the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of their hearts was only evil continually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have disagreements with Islam, sure. Islam has many disagreements with Christianity (outside of the Dome of the Rock). Muslims, however are made in God’s image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1613-14&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:13-14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, “You are a God of seeing,” for she said, “Truly here I have seen him who looks after me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; it lies between Kadesh and Bered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hagar is likely stunned that she would merit such supernatural favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Roi (“row-ee” not “roy”) is God who Sees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrator uses God’s Covenant Name, but Hagar does not. Neither she nor the Ishmaelites are a party to God’s covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area is in the Negev in the wilderness. Moses and the Israelites likely passed the area on the way to Kadesh Barnea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1615-16&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:15-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;galatians-connection&#34;&gt;Galatians connection:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and one by a free woman. But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, while the son of the free woman was born through promise. Now this may be interpreted allegorically: these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar. Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children. But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother. For it is written, “Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear; break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor! For the children of the desolate one will be more than those of the one who has a husband.” Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise. But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now. But what does the Scripture say? “Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.” So, brothers, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman. Galatians 4:22-31&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Peter 3:15-16 And count the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him, as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul has a lot to say about being under the law in Galatians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter writes that people twist Paul “to their own destruction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this includes some commentators today who say Paul came to replace Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul himself identified as a Torah-observant Jew AFTER his Damascus Road experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Acts 21, people report that Paul is teaching others to forsake the law of Moses – these are FALSE accusations of Paul’s accusers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 21:39 and 22:3, “I AM a Jew (not “was”). 23:6: “I AM a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees” (not “was”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 23:9 – Pharisees pronounce Paul innocent – would they have done this if Paul had renounced Judaism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if teachers today teach that Paul forsook the Torah and renounced Judaism, is that teaching true or false?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue Paul is addressing in Galatians is the same issue many Christians struggle with: the grace of God seems too good to be true, so we feel we must somehow bring something to the table to justify ourselves. We call this “works-righteousness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the Israelites were freed from slavery and THEN they were given the Torah. We come to Jesus first, and then our lives, including our behavior and obedience, are transformed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Works-righteousness was and is a perversion of God’s gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of waiting for God’s promises Paul argues that typologically Abraham and Hagar represent works-righteousness, i.e. slavery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;misslers-conclusion&#34;&gt;Missler’s conclusion:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s servants are to trust His Word and to wait for its fulfillment, enduring patiently till the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes increasingly clear in Genesis that any person or any nation that owes its existence to divine election should live by faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human efforts will not help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the good news for God’s people is that the living God sees and hears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dont-sire-any-ishmaels&#34;&gt;Don’t sire any Ishmaels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one time about 25 years ago when email was still relatively new. While discussing something else, I happened to vent to my boss about someone in another department. I could have been less direct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the email chain got forwarded up to my Senior VP, who forwarded it to his Senior VP counterpart in the other department, and it got back to the person I said the not-nice things about. Of course I had no idea this had happened until…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weeks later, that person showed up in my office one day – mind you we didn’t work in the same building. He sought me out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was definitely a “wanna get away moment.” I did the whole “that’s not who I am or who I want to be” apology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was telling my then-pastor about it; he smiled he said, “Yep. When you typed the email, you sired an Ishmael.” At first, I said, “that’s not funny.” And then I said, “That’s a great phrase.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we act in the flesh instead of the Spirit we sire an Ishmael, a wild ass that is virtually uncontrollable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our greatest risk is our tongues – it’s why the Bible spends so much time trying to warn us about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish thought hits the topic hard – they call it “lashon hara” – the evil tongue and they associate biblical leprosy with Lashon hara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No specific geographic information is provided, but it’s reasonable to believe the meeting took place at the same site as one of their prior meetings. Therefore Beer Sheba is a good guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Genesis 17, God reaffirms His promise to Abraham, whose name God has recently changed. Abraham means “father of multitudes,” which at this point has to be considered a prophecy. As a sign of the covenant, God institutes circumcision. Sarai’s name is changed to Sarah, meaning “Princess.” God reiterates that Sarah will have a child in her old age. Abraham laughs, and God says the son’s name shall be Laughter “Yitzhak.” Abraham then circumcises himself, his son Ishmael, and the rest of his household (who probably weren’t laughing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-171-2-abraham-is-99-when-lord-appears-again&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:1-2: Abraham is 99 when LORD appears again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Now when Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, “I am God Almighty; Walk before Me, and be blameless. “I will make My covenant between Me and you, And I will multiply you exceedingly” (New American Standard Version).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first mention of God Almighty = El Shaddai&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Used 48x in OT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t exactly sure what “shaddai” means, but it has the sense of supplier, strength, protector, guardian, and sufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mezuzot and tefillin (phylacteries) have the Hebrew &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;שׁ&lt;/span&gt; for Shaddai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster: “He is sufficient to meet our needs. He is sufficient to carry us and sustain us, even through the long, dry spells when we do not necessarily feel His presence.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen years have passed between Genesis 16 and 17 and twenty-four years since Genesis 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, Abraham assumed Ishmael was the promised son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster sees a separate covenant from Genesis 15, one that “reaffirms all the same promises but increases their scope.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most other commentators would agree that the scope is increased but it’s the same covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster sees the following distinctions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Gen 15&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Gen 17&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Unconditional, Abram was asleep&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Abraham must live out his life with integrity and walk with God, submitting to His Authority.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A great nation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A multitude of nations (4)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Abundant seed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Kings come forth (6)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Land is a possession.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Canaan is an everlasting possession (8)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Name and mother of son not stated – Abraham assumed Ishmael&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sarah will have a son to be named Isaac (16, 20-21)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be hyperanalyzing the two covenants, but it’s interesting (I have three of his commentaries, and he only mentioned this in the oldest one; it’s entirely possible he’s since backed off of this viewpoint).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to walk before God and be blameless?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster writes, “Messianic Paul Leavertoff said, “If you want to know God, you must first have the certainty that He knows and loves you.” That’s the basis for a friendship, such as Abraham experienced with God.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-173-4-father-of-multitudes&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:3-4: Father of multitudes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying, “As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, And you will be the father of a multitude of nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A minor point perhaps, but it doesn’t say “our covenant” it says “My covenant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster’s view notwithstanding, it could be God is reiterating that the covenant is unilateral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is in response to chapter 16, where we might say Abraham tried to meet the terms of God’s covenant in Abraham&amp;rsquo;s own power apart from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton notes “no parallels in the ancient world to covenants between diety and mortal. Gods make demands and promise favor…but these fall far short of a covenant relationship initiated by diety for His own purposes.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-175-6-abram-to-abraham&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:5-6: Abram to Abraham&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No longer shall you be named Abram, But your name shall be Abraham; For I have made you the father of a multitude of nations. “I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham = father of multitudes. For a moment this must have seemed like a cruel joke. He was 99. Imagine the snickering when he told his men his new name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, the King of Kings will come from Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 1:1: The record of the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned, Romans 4 is Paul’s exposition on Genesis 15:6, “Abraham believed and it was credited to him as righteousness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul makes a reference to Genesis 17:5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 4:17-18 (as it is written: “I HAVE MADE YOU A FATHER OF MANY NATIONS”) in the presence of Him whom he believed, that is, God, who gives life to the dead and calls into being things that do not exist. [18] In hope against hope he believed, so that he might become a father of many nations according to that which had been spoken, “SO SHALL YOUR DESCENDANTS BE.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Abram to Abraham and Sarai to Sarah have the Hebrew letter &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ה&lt;/span&gt; added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some see the breath of God’s spirit as when God breathed life into Adam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word for love is pronounced ahav (&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אהב&lt;/span&gt;), which is adding a &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ה&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אב&lt;/span&gt;, the word for “father.” The &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ה&lt;/span&gt; thus represents love as the essence of the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, as with Adam, that which you name you have dominion over – God is establishing a special relationship with this couple by naming them personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God renamed Abram. God named Isaac prior to conception. God renamed Jacob as Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-177-8-you-and-your-descendants&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:7-8: you and your descendants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations as an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your descendants after you. “And I will give to you and to your descendants after you the land where you live as a stranger, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is the primary beneficiary of the covenant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary concluded her beautiful &lt;em&gt;Magnificat&lt;/em&gt; in Luke 1 with a reference to Genesis 17:7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Mary said: “My soul exalts the Lord, And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior. “For He has had regard for the humble state of His bond-servant; For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed. “For the Mighty One has done great things for me; And holy is His name. “And His mercy is to generation after generation Toward those who fear Him. “He has done mighty deeds with His arm; He has scattered those who were proud in the thoughts of their hearts. “He has brought down rulers from their thrones, And has exalted those who were humble. “He has filled the hungry with good things, And sent the rich away empty-handed. “He has given help to His servant Israel, In remembrance of His mercy, Just as He spoke to our fathers, To Abraham and his descendants forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zechariah similarly invoked Abraham in the famous &lt;em&gt;Benedictus&lt;/em&gt; Luke 1:68-75:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, For He has visited us and accomplished redemption for His people, And has raised up a horn of salvation for us In the house of His servant David— Just as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from ancient times— Salvation from our enemies, And from the hand of all who hate us; To show mercy to our fathers, And to remember His holy covenant, The oath which He swore to our father Abraham, To grant us that we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies, Would serve Him without fear, In holiness and righteousness before Him all our days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-179-11-circumcision&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:9-11: Circumcision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 God said further to Abraham, “Now as for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations. “This is My covenant, which you shall keep, between Me and you and your descendants after you: every male among you shall be circumcised. “And you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be the sign of the covenant between Me and you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s covenants are always associated with a sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah – rainbow; Abraham-circumcision; Moses-the Sabbath; David-a House (both in terms of a building and a royal bloodline); Jesus/New Covenant-Bread and Wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this covenant dealt with progeny and legacy, God selected the relevant part of the body for the covenant’s sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intent is that every time a son of Abraham engages in reproduction, they would be reminded not only of the covenant with Abraham but the individual’s role both as beneficiary and trustee in the covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circumcision was fairly common in the ancient near east, though as we shall see, over time it becomes associated with Abraham’s children and not the larger gentile world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton: “Circumcision can be seen as one of many cases where God transforms a common practice to a new purpose in revealing Himself and relating to his people.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Paul’s major points is that Genesis 15:6 comes before 17:10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, belief/faith comes first, followed by Obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 4:10-12: How then was (Abraham’s faith) credited? While he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? Not while circumcised, but while uncircumcised; and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while uncircumcised, so that he might be the father of all who believe without being circumcised, that righteousness might be credited to them, and the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also follow in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had while uncircumcised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1712-13-the-8supthsup-day&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:12-13: the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 “And every male among you who is eight days old shall be circumcised throughout your generations, including a slave who is born in the house or who is bought with money from any foreigner, who is not of your descendants. “A slave who is born in your house or who is bought with your money shall certainly be circumcised; so My covenant shall be in your flesh as an everlasting covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler suggests that the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day is when Vitamin K and Prothrombin peak in the body at 110% of normal before stabilizing at normal levels, helping with healing and pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Christianity, we say that baptism is supposed to be an outward sign of an inward change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circumcision is sort of like this, though, for Jews at 8 days old, it is certainly it’s an outward sign of what is expected to be an inward change. The stock market might call it a forward-looking statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presumably, when the age of accountability is reached the boy would realize he’s under the covenant and act accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either case, the act is a sign of the covenant; in other words, it points to the covenant, it is not the covenant itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting circumcised doesn’t make one Jewish any more than getting baptized makes one a Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism doesn’t make you a Christian; you’re a Christian; therefore, you get baptized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Moses, Jeremiah, and Paul will dig into the theme of “circumcision of the heart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteronomy 30:6 “Moreover, the LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the hearts of your descendants, to love the LORD your God with all your heart and all your soul, so that you may live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah 9:26 Egypt, Judah, Edom, the sons of Ammon, Moab, and all those inhabiting the desert who trim the hair on their temples; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised of heart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 2:28-29 For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh. [29] But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter; and his praise is not from people, but from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circumcision of the Flesh reminds Jews that they’re under a unique covenant that requires circumcision of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water Baptism reminds a Christian that we’re under a unique covenant that requires Baptism of the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not that far apart – our procedure is less painful but their procedure probably better assures converts are committed to their new faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that “circumcision of the heart” does not replace physical circumcision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read verse 13 again. (Physical) circumcision is an “EVERLASTING” covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the various “sabbath controversies” in the Gospels, Jesus demonstrates that the things that He was doing were not violations of Shabbat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Jewish Messiah could not have violated the Sabbath and still claim to be the Jewish Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Sabbath act was related to bettering the human condition and alleviating suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ argument was that they were approved exceptions (even though those exceptions were not generally accepted in the Jewish community – He came to redefine/correct their view of the Sabbath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that regard, Jesus could have easily pointed to the command to circumcise on the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jewish practice, the circumcision (called a ‘bris’ in American and Europe) is performed on the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day even if the baby is born on a Friday (which presumably 14.2% of Jewish babies are).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The command is so important to furthering life (as represented by the original Covenant with Abraham) it supersedes Sabbath restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1714-uncircumcised-shall-be-cut-off&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:14: Uncircumcised shall be cut off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 “But as for an uncircumcised male, one who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that person shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One who refuses to get cut off shall be cut off (hard to miss the irony in that one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, the son of a Jewish father and a gentile mother is not Jewish and is not required to be circumcised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is different for a Jewish mother, whose male son was required to be circumcised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guideline was evidently in play in the first century as Paul had timothy circumcised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 16:1-3 Now Paul also came to Derbe and to Lystra. And a disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek … Paul wanted this man to leave with him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had ever wondered why Paul, who was typically so “anti-circumcision,” had Timothy circumcised, now you know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you got circumcised in a hospital, this was a worldly medical procedure; even though it probably has some health benefits, it is not the same as a covenant of circumcision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a previously circumcised gentile converts to Judiasm, a drop of blood from that area will be obtained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The covenant was a free gift (well, mostly free). Just as someone named in a will can refuse an inheritance, refusing to be circumcised means the person was opting out of God’s covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can a person lose his or her salvation? Probably not if the person falls away through deception or falling into some sin pattern, but is God going to force a person who once made a profession but later willfully opts out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1715-16-sarai-to-sarah&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:15-16: Sarai to Sarah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 Then God said to Abraham, “As for your wife Sarai, you shall not call her by the name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name. “I will bless her, and indeed I will give you a son by her. Then I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah means princess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Famous sons are often preceded by divine announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster tells of a Jewish fable that is curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As context, Sarai ends with the Hebrew letter yod (&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;י&lt;/span&gt;); the yod was dropped and replaced with a hei to form Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the yod was lost from the end of Sarai’s name, it soared up to heaven to protest. “Is it because I am the smallest of all the letters that You have removed me from the name of righteous Sarai?” God replied, “Previously you were the last letter in a woman’s name. I am promoting you to the first letter in a man’s name.” For Moses renamed the son of Nun Yehoshua from Hoshea (Numbers 13:16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Followers of our Messiah raise an eyebrow at this story because in the first century, the name Yeshoshua had been abbreviated to Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster concludes, “the little letter yod had no further reason to complain about the change of Sarai’s name” as it is now associated with the Messiah.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1717&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:17&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17 Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, “Will a child be born to a man a hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, give birth to a child?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham assumed his descendants would come through Ishmael, whom Abraham loved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verb for laugh is Tzhak. Yitzhak is related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also means joking, mocking, sporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Genesis 26:8 Isaac is Tzhaking with Rebekkah (translated in NASB as caressing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Genesis 21:9 the son of Hagar is Tzahaking Isaac (translated in NASB as mocking), prompting Sarah to tell Abraham to drive out the slave woman and her son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul continues in Romans 4, with a reference to Abraham’s and Sarah’s old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 4:18-22: In hope against hope he believed, so that he might become a father of many nations according to that which had been spoken, “SO SHALL YOUR DESCENDANTS BE.” Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah’s womb; yet, with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in unbelief but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully assured that what God had promised, He was able also to perform. Therefore IT WAS ALSO CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1718-19&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:18-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Abraham said to God, “Oh that Ishmael might live before You!” But God said, “No, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you shall name him Isaac; and I will establish My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abraham loved Ishmael&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1720-22&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:20-22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 “As for Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I will bless him, and make him fruitful and multiply him exceedingly. He shall father twelve princes, and I will make him into a great nation. “But I will establish My covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this season next year.” When He finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1723-27&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:23-27&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abraham took his son Ishmael, and all the slaves who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s household, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin on this very same day, as God had said to him. Now Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. And his son Ishmael was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. On this very same day Abraham was circumcised, as well as his son Ishmael. And all the men of his household, those who were born in the house or bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham’s 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; test: to undergo such a painful ritual, Abraham had to have faith in the promise which had not yet materialized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have been stressing, his faith came first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of his faith he then changed his behavior to conform to God’s standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use our terminology, He didn’t get circumcised to get righteous with God; he got circumcised because by faith, he already was righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are saved by virtue of our faith, not by our ethnicity or whether we have undergone a ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle over circumcision in the Apostolic era was heated and complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We make it about “Law versus Grace,” but that is oversimplifying the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a side that reasonably believed that one had to be Jewish to follow a Jewish messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore Gentiles who came to faith should naturally wish to convert to Judaism and undergo circumcision in keeping with the expressed wishes of God in the Abrahamic covenant we just read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul agreed the commandment should continue to be required for Jewish people who come to faith in Messiah (as we saw with Timothy)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul and others cited verses in the Old Testament that said Gentiles would believe in Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Paul’s arguments is that if you required gentiles to convert to Judism, then they would henceforth be Jews not Gentiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are no gentiles, how can the OT passages regarding gentiles following Messiah be fulfilled?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, these adult believers would now be legally Jewish and required to keep the Torah, just the same as Jews who had been raised in Jewish homes and communities. The gentile converts would be at a severe disadvantage (see Galatians 5:3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a believer in Yeshua had the desire and discipline to begin the path to conversion to Judaism, that was great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A late first-century document called the Didache appears to state that such conversion could be a reasonable path for many mature disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be wrong to require such discipline from a brand-new gentile believer; it would be setting them up to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another of Paul’s arguments is that by requiring conversion to Judaism, the gentiles would have to earn their salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gentiles who believed this were trying to earn their way into heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our faith doesn’t work like that; what’s more, the Torah doesn’t teach that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still another of Paul’s arguments hinges upon the fact that Paul found Abraham’s new name significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just a “great nation” in Genesis 12 and 15, but now a multitude of goyim, gentile nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are sons of Abraham not by bloodline but by faith in Yeshua the perfect seed of Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul was not anti-Judaism; he was against the perversion of Judaism into a works-based religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m confident he would similarly be against 21st-century examples of works-based righteousness that are present in many Christian churches today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we say, be a Berean. Don’t take my word for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try reading Galatians with this assumption about Paul and see if it doesn’t make more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster: “Yeshua of Nazareth is the ultimate fulfillment of the Abrahamic promises. He is the promised Messiah, the Son of Abraham in whom all nations will be blessed. As children of Abraham, we share in his firm hope, his faith in God, and the promised Seed of Abraham. He is the father of all who believe.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-181-2&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:1-2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the LORD appeared to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre while he was sitting at the tent door in the heat of the day. When he raised his eyes and looked, behold, three men were standing opposite him; and when he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed down to the ground,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tents were designed to hold in heat at night but flaps can open to allow breezes during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham does not yet know that these three are supernatural, and we aren’t told when he realizes that they aren’t. Without any fanfare, all of a sudden, he knows he’s talking to the LORD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-183-5&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:3-5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and said, “My Lord, if now I have found favor in Your sight, please do not pass Your servant by. “Please let a little water be brought and wash your feet, and make yourselves comfortable under the tree, and I will bring a piece of bread so that you may refresh yourselves; after that, you may go on since you have visited your servant.” And they said, “So do as you have said.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the standards of the day, Abraham was required to do this, but he went above and beyond, as we shall see in the next passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospitality may have had a pragmatic goal – you never knew when someone approaching could be an enemy. Here was a chance to potentially transform an enemy into a friend, at least temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washing the feet of guests was a standard act of hospitality, given the often dry and dusty roads of the ancient near east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often a bowl was placed by the door and the guest washed their own feet – this appears to be what Abraham offers here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some commentators will note that feet washing was so nasty, typically only the lowest servant could be assigned to wash another’s feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this makes Jesus’ act at the Last Supper all the more remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust&#34;&gt;Walking in His Dust&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 13:2 Do not neglect hospitality to strangers, for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We typically think of entertaining and hospitality as something like a fellowship meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it includes that, more broadly, hospitality includes any act of aid and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of the Good Samaritan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospitality is loving your neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice again God’s ways vs the World’s ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world says look out for #1, never deny our own desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entertaining is OK as long as you get something out of it (showing off the fact that you have the means to host a big party, or maybe cultivate a new business contact).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God says to give selflessly to help others who may never be able to repay you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter elaborates on this: “Above all, keep loving one another earnestly since love covers a multitude of sins. Show hospitality to one another without grumbling. As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God&amp;rsquo;s varied grace: whoever speaks, as one who speaks oracles of God; whoever serves, as one who serves by the strength that God supplies—in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. (1 Peter 4:8-11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-186-8&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:6-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, “Quickly, prepare three measures of fine flour, knead it, and make bread cakes.” Abraham also ran to the herd and took a tender and choice calf and gave it to the servant, and he hurried to prepare it. He took curds and milk and the calf which he had prepared and set it before them, and he was standing by them under the tree as they ate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham was not obligated to prepare a calf; yogurt and bread would have been sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A measure is a seah, which is about 20 quarts. This was a banquet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more onerous of the Jewish dietary restrictions is that one cannot mix dairy and meat; this is curious as right here, Abraham is doing just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In restaurants, there are designated dairy and non-dairy sections; even if your meal doesn’t have any dairy, you are not allowed to sit in the dairy section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restriction comes from Exodus 23:19, which only says, “you are not to boil a young goat in the milk of its mother.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tree is venerated in Hebron today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-189-12&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:9-12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they said to him, “Where is your wife, Sarah?” And he said, “There, in the tent.” He said, “I will certainly return to you at this time next year; and behold, your wife Sarah will have a son.” And Sarah was listening at the tent door, which was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; Sarah was past childbearing. So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, “After I have become old, am I to have pleasure, my lord being old also?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah was in the tent, likely because the tradition was women did not eat with men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1813-16&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:13-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the LORD said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ‘Shall I actually give birth to a child when I am so old?’ “Is anything too difficult for the LORD? At the appointed time, I will return to you, at this time next year, and Sarah will have a son.” Sarah denied it, however, saying, “I did not laugh”; for she was afraid. And He said, “No, but you did laugh.” Then the men rose up from there and looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham was walking with them to send them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without any prior notice, we now learn that the LORD is among the visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have to piece things together but since three men showed up initially and we learn that only two will be in Sodom and those two are angels, the makeup of the three visitors is most likely (allowing for other permutations) the LORD (possibly in the form of pre-incarnate Jesus) and two mighty angels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We note that both Abraham and Sarah laughed but only Sarah was chided for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, it might not be the crime but the cover-up that got her in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard to top the KJV here “Nay, but thou didst laugh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the word for laugh is Tzahaq which is linguistically related to Ytzhaq, Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1817-19&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:17-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do, since Abraham will certainly become a great and mighty nation, and in him, all the nations of the earth will be blessed? “For I have chosen him, so that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing righteousness and justice, so that the LORD may bring upon Abraham what He has spoken about him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham’s grandfather and Shem were alive at the same time; no doubt the story of the Flood was still “fresh” in everyone’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potentially Abraham would see the destruction of Sodom and think the world is ending in judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God averts that by reassuring him this is only a local judgment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1820-22&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:20-22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the LORD said, “The outcry of Sodom and Gomorrah is indeed great, and their sin is exceedingly grave. “I will go down now and see whether they have done entirely as the outcry, which has come to Me indicates; and if not, I will know.” Then the men turned away from there and went toward Sodom while Abraham was still standing before the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our just God is investigating the situation before issuing the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of Genesis 19, with the men banging on the door, was the trial&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 13 will be the verdict “The Lord has sent us to destroy it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hailfire was the penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1823-33&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:23-33&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham approached and said, “Will You indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked? “Suppose there are fifty righteous people within the city; will You indeed sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Far be it from You to do such a thing, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike. Far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth deal justly?” So the LORD said, “If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the entire place on their account.” And Abraham replied, “Now behold, I have ventured to speak to the Lord, although I am only dust and ashes. “Suppose the fifty righteous are lacking five; will You destroy the entire city because of five?” And He said, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he spoke to Him yet again and said, “Suppose forty are found there?” And He said, “I will not do it on account of the forty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he said, “Oh, may the Lord not be angry, and I shall speak; suppose thirty are found there?” And He said, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he said, “Now behold, I have ventured to speak to the Lord; suppose twenty are found there?” And He said, “I will not destroy it on account of the twenty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he said, “Oh, may the Lord not be angry, and I shall speak only this once: suppose ten are found there?” And He said, “I will not destroy it on account of the ten.” As soon as He had finished speaking to Abraham the LORD departed, and Abraham returned to his place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middle eastern haggling is a well-earned stereotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice is not served by ignoring wickedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had there been higher numbers of righteous, the city might have been spared only if they could have exerted a reforming influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, there will not even be 10 righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-191-3&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:1-3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the two angels came to Sodom in the evening as Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he stood up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he said, “Now behold, my lords, please turn aside into your servant’s house, and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may rise early and go on your way.” They said, “No, but we shall spend the night in the public square.” Yet he strongly urged them, so they turned aside to him and entered his house; and he prepared a feast for them and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downward progression of Lot. Now he’s sitting at the gate, which is equivalent to being on the city council or chamber of commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unleavened bread here because they arrived in the evening and there was not time for the bread to rise prior to baking. When they arrived at Hebron it was the middle of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our Gospels study, we noted that John 3 took place at night and John four took place during the day (Jesus moves us from darkness to light).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here Genesis 18 takes place during the day and most of Genesis 19 talkes place at night (sin such as Sodom moves us from light to darkness)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of hospitality is that the host is responsible for the safety and well-being of his guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lot will take this extremely seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-194-5&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:4-5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before they lay down, the men of the city—the men of Sodom—surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter; and they called to Lot and said to him, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may have relations with them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-196-9&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:6-9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Lot went out to them at the doorway, and shut the door behind him,and said, “Please, my brothers, do not act wickedly. “Now look, I have two daughters who have not had relations with any man; please let me bring them out to you, and do to them whatever you like; only do not do anything to these men, because they have come under the shelter of my roof.” But they said, “Get out of the way!” They also said, “This one came in as a foreigner, and already he is acting like a judge; now we will treat you worse than them!” So they pressed hard against Lot and moved forward to break the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1910-13&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:10-13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them, and shut the door. Then they struck the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness, from the small to the great, so that they became weary of trying to find the doorway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the two men said to Lot, “Whom else do you have here? A son-in-law and your sons and daughters, and whomever you have in the city, bring them out of the place;for we are about to destroy this place, because their outcry has become so great before the LORD that the LORD has sent us to destroy it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1914&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, and said, “Up, get out of this place, for the LORD is destroying the city.” But he appeared to his sons-in-law to be joking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1915-17&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:15-17&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Up, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city.” But he hesitated. So the men grasped his hand and the hand of his wife and the hands of his two daughters, because the compassion of the LORD was upon him; and they brought him out and put him outside the city. When they had brought them outside, one said, “Escape for your life! Do not look behind you, and do not stay anywhere in the surrounding area; escape to the mountains, or you will be swept away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1918-19&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:18-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Lot said to them, “Oh no, my lords! “Now behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your compassion, which you have shown me by saving my life; but I cannot escape to the mountains, for the disaster will overtake me and I will die;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1920-22&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:20-22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 now behold, this town is near enough to flee to, and it is small. Please, let me escape there (is it not small?) so that my life may be saved.” And he said to him, “Behold, I grant you this request also, not to overthrow the town of which you have spoken. “Hurry, escape there, for I cannot do anything until you arrive there.” Therefore the town was named Zoar. The sun had risen over the earth when Lot came to Zoar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1924-26&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:24-26&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD rained brimstone and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah from the LORD out of heaven, and He overthrew those cities, and all the surrounding area, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground. But Lot’s wife, from behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1927-28&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:27-28&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Abraham got up early in the morning and went to the place where he had stood before the LORD; and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the surrounding area; and behold, he saw the smoke of the land ascended like the smoke of a furnace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1929-30&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:29-30&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it came about, when God destroyed the cities of the surrounding area, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the destruction, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot had lived. Now Lot went up from Zoar with his two daughters and stayed in the mountains, because he was afraid to stay in Zoar; and he stayed in a cave, he and his two daughters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1931-35&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:31-35&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to have relations with us according to the custom of all the earth. “Come, let’s make our father drink wine, and let’s sleep with him so that we may keep our family alive through our father.” So they made their father drink wine that night, and the firstborn went in and slept with her father; and he did not know when she lay down or got up. On the following day, the firstborn said to the younger, “Look, I slept last night with my father; let’s make him drink wine tonight too, then you go in and sleep with him, so that we may keep our family alive through our father.” So they had their father drink wine that night too, and the younger got up and slept with him; and he did not know when she lay down or got up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1936-38&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:36-38&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so both of the daughters of Lot conceived by their father. The firstborn gave birth to a son, and named him Moab; he is the father of the Moabites to this day. As for the younger, she also gave birth to a son, and named him Ben-ammi; he is the father of the sons of Ammon to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:5.92361in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These episodes take place primarily in Gerar and Beersheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham relocates to Gerar, a pagan kingdom (blue arrow towards Gerar) where he has another lack of faith (he didn&amp;rsquo;t learn the lesson from Egypt) in which he tells a 1/2 truth that Sarah was his sister.  God intervened again to preserve the purity of his promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac, the son of the Promise (Gal 4:23-26) is born possibly at Gerar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 21, Abraham makes a treaty with the king of Gerar at Beersheva - well of seven/oath&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-201&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there Abraham journeyed toward the territory of the Negeb and lived between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason we don’t have many archeological remains from this period is the nomadic lifestyle. People like Abraham moved somewhere, then moved on, often being deliberate about not leaving a trace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all Hebrew words have the accent on the last syllable. One exception is certain two syllable word that have a short e vowel. So the word for desert is not pronounced nuh-GEV, but NEH-gev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerar is possibly a region, not a specific city, but many archeologists point to this location about 15 miles northwest of Beersheva as the likely location.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kadesh, or Kadesh Barnea, will become a pivotal location later in the Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is here that the 12 spies returned. When the 10 brought back a bad report and spread fear through the camp, a riot ensued. As punishment, God sentenced the people to wander in the wilderness for 38 more years (a total of 40), while that generation died off, except for the two spies who brought back a good report: Joshua and Caleb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-202&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oy vey!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the eighth test of Abraham, according to the sages. He doesn’t do so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sometimes face the same challenges repeatedly because we keep getting them wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever blind spot Abraham has in his faith, he, unfortunately, passes it down to Isaac, who will pull the same ruse with Rebekah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 99-year-old woman was desirable. She must have been extremely beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abimelech comes from two Hebrew words, Avi – my father and Melech – king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is probably a title, “my father the king” (like a “lord and master” title in medieval times) versus a given name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-203-5&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:3-5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man&amp;rsquo;s wife.” Now Abimelech had not approached her. So he said, “Lord, will you kill an innocent people? Did he not himself say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In one of the many mysteries of God, He periodically makes Himself known to non-Israelites. He also does this with Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar. Even more puzzling is that none of the three are recorded as putting their faith in the God of Abraham despite the divine encounter. Nebuchadnezzar comes closest in Daniel 4, but there is little historical evidence that he had a major change of heart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-206-8&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:6-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her. Now then, return the man&amp;rsquo;s wife, for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you, and you shall live. But if you do not return her, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours.” So Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things. And the men were very much afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling Abraham a “prophet” might have been a term that Abimelech understood to mean Abraham had a unique relationship with his God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham was not necessarily a giver of prophecy the way we think of the term (as it relates to Elijah, Isaiah, and so forth).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prophecy is not limited to the prediction and fulfillment of future events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prophet is someone who speaks the words of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pragmatically, Abimelech also would have understood that as a prophet, Abraham had the ability to bless Abimelech, which in his mind would have equated to material blessings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-209-10&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:9-10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done.” And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you see, that you did this thing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s not wrong. Abraham blew his witness here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the way the KJV words 2 Sam 12:14. 2 Samuel 12:14 (KJV) by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is when Nathan confronts David over his sin with Bathsheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the other translations say something to the effect of “because you have disrespected the Lord.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KJV focuses on the end result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we mess up publicly we misrepresent God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re supposed to be God’s ambassadors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our character represents His character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You didn’t just disrespect the Lord, which is bad enough. Your behavior reflected so poorly on your king that they blasphemed Him.” Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did you see? I love that choice of words. We have a natural tendency to literally or figuratively see things that aren’t real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learn from verse 17 that there was a plague of barrenness upon Abimelech’s house because of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, some time would have needed to elapse before making the conclusion that they were afflicted with barrenness, yet this all apparently happened on the night Abimelech took Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would they know this was a plague from God in one night?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s just say one speculation is that Abimelech and his men needed to ask their doctor whether a particular class of medication was right for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another might be that those about to give birth were prevented from doing so; including hens unable to lay eggs according to the Talmud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, the text is clear that nothing happened between Sarah and Abimelech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To underscore this and dispel any notion that Abimelech was the father of Isaac, Jewish tradition holds that Isaac’s physical appearance was in all respects identical to Abraham&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, mocking traditions would later arise that Abimelech was the father of Isaac, just as mocking traditions arose that Jesus had a natural biologic father, whether by Joseph or a Roman soldier named Pantera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac foreshadows Jesus in many ways, the greatest of which we will see next time in Genesis 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2011-13&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:11-13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham said, “I did it because I thought, ‘There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’ Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife. And when God caused me to wander from my father&amp;rsquo;s house, I said to her, ‘This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seemed like a good idea at the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His assessment was incorrect. There WAS a fear of God in that place and Abimelech respected the boundaries of marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get into trouble when we draw unsolicited conclusions about another’s spiritual status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck Missler used to say “don’t draw vast conclusions from half-vast data.” (Let me know when you get the pun.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is much better to give our neighbors the benefit of the doubt unless/until proven otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another “sire an Ishmael” moment, though God spared Abraham any negative consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A half-truth with an intent to deceive is a full lie. In the same way, spreading an embarrassing fact about someone else with the intent to hurt that person is gossip and slander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see that Abraham devised this con before coming to the promised land. When we come to God, we need to cleanse out our old ways. For some of us, a lifetime is not enough, but we still try to live a God-honoring life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible does not hide the flaws of its leaders. It is possible to be a man or woman who is used mightily by God yet still flawed. That should give us encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2014-16&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:14-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him. And Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you.” To Sarah, he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is a sign of your innocence in the eyes of all who are with you, and before everyone, you are vindicated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1000 shekels is about 25 pounds of silver, more than a worker could expect to make in a lifetime.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s Abimelech’s guarantee that Sarah was untouched and an appeasement to the prophet of the deity who cursed Abimelech’s household with barrenness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it’s not a gift, it’s a transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham upholds his end of the contract in verse 17 and God is appeased in verse 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to give Abimelech due credit here – even though he did not wrong Abraham with prior knowledge or intent; he still makes it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-his-dust-talmidim-way-insight&#34;&gt;In His Dust Talmidim Way Insight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have wronged someone, we are obligated to ask for forgiveness.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages teach that even though Abimelech made financial restitution, his full atonement came when he asked Abraham to intercede with prayer to God. Abimelech would have had to ask Abraham for this, so it follows that Abimelech had to ask Abraham for forgiveness for any anguish he caused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Forgive others, that God may forgive you” (e.g., Mat 6:14-15) is not exclusively a New Testament idea; it is well attested to in the Talmud. It’s a Jewish concept that our Jewish Messiah teaches us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought is not that God’s forgiveness is conditional; it is unconditional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought is, how can we call ourselves &lt;em&gt;talmidim&lt;/em&gt; if we ask God for forgiveness but refuse to forgive others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the important aspects of Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, is seeking forgiveness for the sins we did not even know we committed. I wish Christianity had a day like that. An entire day devoted to getting right with God and our neighbors. Sign me up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ephesians 4:32 Be kind to one another, compassionate, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2017-18&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:17-18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children. For the LORD had closed all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham&amp;rsquo;s wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham’s intercession brings immediate spiritual and physical relief; even though up to this point, Abraham’s prayers for he and Sarah to have a child have remained unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is because Abraham prayed for others that allowed God to bless Abraham and Sarah with Isaac. What’s holding you back from praying for others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrative Abraham and Abimelech continues in Genesis 21:22&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orange arrow from Gerar (box 6) towards Egypt marks the expulsion of Ishmael and Hagar into the wilderness of Beersheba&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separation was necessary to protect the son of the promise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red arrow from Beersheba to Jerusalem (box 7) denotes the path to and from the offering of Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Map credit&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-21-and-romans-galatians-and-hebrews&#34;&gt;Genesis 21 and Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An understanding of Genesis 21 is paramount to understanding Paul’s/Hebrew’s arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews and only these three New Testament books discuss Genesis 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acts references the birth of Isaac; James and Hebrews reference the sacrifice of Isaac in Genesis 22.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to read Galatians and come away that Paul was somehow anti-law or anti-Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This train of thought is deeply flawed and runs the risk of missing Paul’s points entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is focused not on Judaism as a whole, but on the Messiah-rejecting Jews who are knowingly or unknowingly continuing in legalism instead of accepting the free gift the Messiah brings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, the three books, and only these three New Testament books quote Habakkuk 2:4 (KJV) “but the just shall live by his faith.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews seem to form a trilogy on Habakkuk 2:4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme of Romans: who are the justified?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme of Galatians: how shall the justified live?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme of Hebrews: faith in the promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads many to suspect Paul is the author of Hebrews. If he did not, this is an even greater miracle, because whoever wrote Hebrews unknowingly completed the trilogy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-211-3&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:1-3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD took note of Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for Sarah as He had promised. So Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him. Abraham named his son who was born to him, the son whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:23 But the son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, and the son by the free woman through the promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:11 By faith even Sarah herself received the ability to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other translations say “God remembered Sarah.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not that God forgot, but that He remembered His promise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Appointed time” = &lt;em&gt;mo’ed.&lt;/em&gt; The Jewish festivals are Moedim. Shabbat is a moed. A moed is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Isaac was born on a festival day, just as some speculate Jesus might have been born on Yom Kippur or the first day of Tabernacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either day fits – He is our atonement and he dwells/tabernacles among us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Bible uses a miraculous birth to indicate that God has set aside that child for some great purpose.” (SOM 94)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yitzhak is related to the Hebrew verb &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;צחק&lt;/span&gt;, which means to laugh, but often carries a nuanced connotation of mocking/scorning or even sexual play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’ll unpack more at verse 9.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-214-7&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:4-7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. Now Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me.” And she said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have given birth to a son in his old age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically, in an age of high infant mortality rates, eight days, an infant was considered viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac was circumcised according to the letter of the law on the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is contrasted with Ishmael, who was circumcised at age 13; he was still circumcised, but in a typological sense, not when he “should” have been according to the Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the nuanced meaning of Tzahaq, this may not necessarily be laughing in joy, but laughing in amazement. Sarah and Abraham both laughed in disbelief and perhaps mockery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac’s birth was a true miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an overarching theme in the Bible of God miraculously opening a closed womb. This extends to Mary; although she was not barren in the traditional sense, her womb was miraculously opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God made EVERYTHING in Sarah come to life – she didn’t just give birth but was able to nurse for a couple of years after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-218-10&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:8-10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. Now Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking Isaac. Therefore she said to Abraham, “Drive out this slave woman and her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not be an heir with my son Isaac!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode becomes symbolic of the affliction of the Hebrew/Jewish people throughout the ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:29 But as at that time the son who was born according to the flesh persecuted the one who was born according to the Spirit, so it is even now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:31 So then, brothers and sisters, we are not children of a slave woman, but of the free woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to some reckonings, the 400 years of suffering and affliction culminating in the exodus from Egypt begins with this affliction of Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t have much background on any tradition of a weaning feast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know who Hagar is, but the Narrator wants us to remember her as “Hagar the Egyptian.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did Ishmael do that was so bad that he and his mother had to be driven out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s this word Tzahaq again, translated as mocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Laughter can be used for good or for ill.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:8 Now it came about, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked down through a window, and saw them, and behold, Isaac was &lt;strong&gt;caressing&lt;/strong&gt; his wife Rebekah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caressing = sporting = “Tzahaqing”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael ridiculing and poking fun at his younger brother probably wouldn’t have led to the banishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael was quite possibly a sexual predator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah refuses to speak his name. Whatever it was, it had to be bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust-along-the-talmidim-way&#34;&gt;Walking In His Dust Along The Talmidim Way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;talmidim-must-drive-out-fleshly-works-and-sin-from-our-lives&#34;&gt;Talmidim must drive out fleshly works and sin from our lives.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 5:7 Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, just as you are in fact unleavened. For Christ our Passover also has been sacrificed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another theme in the Bible is the firstborn son doing something to forfeit his inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, the firstborn son receives a double portion of the father’s estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the son does something wicked, he forfeits his promise; then the next in line receives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Ishmael but Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Esau but Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Reuben (and not Simeon or Levi) but Judah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we have an especially odd situation. Joseph was the firstborn of Jacob’s favorite wife Rebekkah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judah receives the official double portion, but Joseph also receives a double portion with Ephraim and Manaesseh being adopted by Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2111-13&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:11-13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matter distressed Abraham greatly because of his son Ishmael. But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed because of the boy and your slave woman; whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her, for through Isaac your descendants shall be named. “And of the son of the slave woman I will make a nation also, because he is your descendant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:28 And you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 9:7 nor are they all children because they are Abraham’s descendants, but: “THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS SHALL BE NAMED.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:18 it was he to whom it was said, “THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS SHALL BE NAMED.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banishment of Ishmael is Abraham’s 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see here that he was reluctant and was “distressed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He loved Ishmael.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His specific tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did he trust God to take care of him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did he trust God’s promises to make Ismael a great nation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did he trust Sarah’s judgment after the last time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial of Ishmael prepared him for the final test in Genesis 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God had previously promised a great future for Ishmael, but Isaac is the one who will inherit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s curious that the Narrator added, “whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her…”. Certainly, this was not the case in Genesis 16 or Genesis 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genesis 3:17 Then to Adam He said, “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat from it’; Cursed is the ground because of you; With hard labor you shall eat from it All the days of your life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2114-16&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:14-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Abraham got up early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water, and gave them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder, and gave her the boy, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered about in the wilderness of Beersheba. When the water in the skin was used up, she left the boy under one of the bushes. Then she went and sat down opposite him, about a bowshot away, for she said, “May I not see the boy die!” And she sat opposite him, and raised her voice and wept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:24 This is speaking allegorically, for these women are two covenants: one coming from Mount Sinai giving birth to children who are to be slaves; she is Hagar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:31 So then, brothers and sisters, we are not children of a slave woman, but of the free woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern makes an interesting comment at Galatians 4:24, “Nowhere does the account in Genesis denigrate Hagar, hense there is no reason to demean the Mosaic Law on the basis of this passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the Torah or Judaism, but people who have perverted the Torah and Judaism into a legalistic system, which is equivalent to a return to slavery in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is essentially the same territory where she wandered in chapter 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned in Israel that in Abraham’s day, towns were generally situated about a day’s journey apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He outfitted her with one day’s provisions with the expectation that she would “refuel” at the next town, perhaps Beersheba 15 miles from Gerar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, she doesn’t make it and heads into the wilderness/desert south of Beersheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did she make it but was turned away because of her “status”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could she not make it that far?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps distressed, did she meander aimlessly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2117-19&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:17-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God heard the boy crying; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What is the matter with you, Hagar? Do not fear, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. “Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him by the hand, for I will make a great nation of him.” Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another significant well moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as in chapter 16, God again sees Hagar and provides materially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also reiterates His promises that Hagar had forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well was there; she just couldn’t see it. That’s a picture of us some days. We can’t open our eyes enough to see the blessing before us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Romans and Galatians, many of us have a dim view of Hagar and Ishmael – certainly, some of this is deserved and as biblical types, they represent the things that we are supposed to reject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s remember the Bible’s worst sinners are pictures of you and me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael messed up “bigly.” We mess up too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here God reaches out and offers both Hagar and Ishmael His mercy and protection. We can be critical because it doesn’t appear that this mercy had any lasting effect. One would have hoped that they could have followed the God of Abraham. We have the same choices when God shows us mercy. How often does God bail us out or see us through a tough spot only to have us forget about God a few moments later?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust-along-the-talmidim-way-1&#34;&gt;Walking In His Dust Along The Talmidim Way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;when-things-seem-hopeless-talmidim-look-for-gods-promises&#34;&gt;When things seem hopeless, talmidim look for God’s promises.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes life hits us and we lose focus. When things seem bleak and we despair, we may need to open our eyes to the goodness of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Peter 3:14-15 But even if you should suffer for righteousness&amp;rsquo; sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2120-21&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:20-21&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God was with the boy, and he grew; and he lived in the wilderness and became an archer. He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paran is in the northeastern Sinai desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This region figures prominently in the Wilderness wanderings (specifically Numbers 13, where Kadesh-Barnea is located).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2122-24&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:22-24&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, “God is with you in all that you do. Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my descendants or with my posterity, but as I have dealt kindly with you, so you will deal with me and with the land where you have sojourned.” And Abraham said, “I will swear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a great testimony. I hope it can someday be said of me “God is with you in all that you do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, God is with me in all that I do; but I don’t always live my life in a way that others recognize it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Abraham’s duplicity, his relationship with Abimelech blossoms into a fruitful and symbiotic partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oaths are legally binding – this is more than a handshake agreement between friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2125&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:25&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Abraham reproved Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech&amp;rsquo;s servants had seized, Abimelech said, “I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it until today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a contract, one party has the right to notify the other if there is a potential material breach. Abraham is doing that here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beersheba is at the northern edge of the Negev desert. Even today, south of Beersheba is sparsely populated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not much water, so what little water there is becomes a hot commodity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our tour guide’s wife is a hydrologist for the nation of Israel – even today, providing enough water for the population is of paramount interest. In the last ten years, the primary water source has shifted from the Jordan River and the Sea of Galilee to desalinated seawater from the Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-his-dust-talmidim-way-insight&#34;&gt;In His Dust Talmidim Way Insight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you reprove someone who has wronged you, have the good in mind.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can learn from Abraham’s admonishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham was not angry, nor seeking to get even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He confronted Abimelech with the goal of restoring their relationship; a relationship Abimelech didn’t even know was injured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge of a leader is that you can’t know everything, but it’s your job to know everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham is reminding Abimelech that it was his job to know that his men were behaving dishonestly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 18:15 “Now if your brother sins, go and show him his fault in private; if he listens to you, you have gained your brother.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to rebuke someone; do it one on one and ideally in person; not on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps an associated insight is we need to &lt;em&gt;receive bad news as an improvement opportunity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can take the position that Abraham’s goal was not to tattle but to build Abimelech up as a leader. This is of course in addition to remedying the immediate situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior executive I worked with paraphrased the famous line from the Godfather, “I want to hear good news right away and bad news immediately.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fostering that kind of culture in an organization takes time but it is critical in our families and ministries as well as our businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the other person is not bringing the criticism forward in a spirit of edification, if the substance of the criticism has merit, we can still learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 3:19 ‘Those whom I love, I rebuke and discipline; therefore be zealous and repent.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2127-28&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:27-28&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant. Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than when it involves Sarah, Abraham is highly skilled as a negotiator and at resolving conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I take comfort in this – I was generally successful as a business executive and viewed as a capable and effective leader; yet I often struggle with leading my own family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheva literally means “seven”; because of this episode, it also comes to mean “oath.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2129-31&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:29-31&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?” He said, “These seven ewe lambs you will take from my hand, that this may be a witness for me that I dug this well.” Therefore that place was called Beersheba, because there both of them swore an oath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells turnout to be extremely significant in scripture. In John 4, Jacob’s well plays a prominent supporting role in the story of Jesus and the Samaritan woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beersheba means literally “well of the seven” but denotatively, “well of the oath.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2132&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:32&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army rose up and returned to the land of the Philistines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit anachronistic as there were not yet Philistines in the coastal plain areas. Egyptians and Canaanites, yes; Philistines, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrator clarifies the geographic location for a later audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first mention of the Philistines in history is around 1180 BC; we believe Abraham lived around 2000 or 1900 BC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s similar to referring to “native Americans” who were around these lands long before the term “America” was used as a geographic label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2133-34&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:33-34&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God. And Abraham sojourned many days in the land of the Philistines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tamarisk is a good tree for the desert. It grows in sandy soil and provides ample shade and food for herbivores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Israel, we learned that “conquering the land” is not always a military campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planting trees, literal and figurative roots in the land, is another way Abraham conquered the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Zionists started to move back around the turn of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, much of the northern part of the country was a swamp. They imported Eucalyptus trees from Australia which sucked up all the water. The land is fertile once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Israel boasts that it plants more trees than it harvests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everlasting in Hebrew is “olam”; it can also mean “world” or “universe”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost all Jewish blessings start with “Baruch ata Adonai Eloheinu, Melech haOlam,” Blessed are you Lord our God, King of the Universe.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we have tension and conflict, we should certainly seek God’s council for relief and godly wisdom on handling the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just don’t forget to call on His name after He delivers you from the test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orange arrow from Gerar (box 6) towards Egypt marks the expulsion of Ishmael and Hagar into the wilderness of Beersheba&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separation was necessary to protect the son of the promise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red arrow from Beersheba to Jerusalem (box 7) denotes the path to and from the offering of Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-21-and-romans-galatians-and-hebrews&#34;&gt;Genesis 21 and Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An understanding of Genesis 21 is paramount to understanding Paul’s/Hebrew’s arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews and only these three New Testament books discuss Genesis 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acts references the birth of Isaac; James and Hebrews reference the sacrifice of Isaac in Genesis 22.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to read Galatians and come away that Paul was somehow anti-law or anti-Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This train of thought is deeply flawed and runs the risk of missing Paul’s points entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is focused not on Judaism as a whole, but on the Messiah-rejecting Jews who are knowingly or unknowingly continuing in legalism instead of accepting the free gift the Messiah brings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, the three books, and only these three New Testament books quote Habakkuk 2:4 (KJV) “but the just shall live by his faith.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews seem to form a trilogy on Habakkuk 2:4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme of Romans: who are the justified?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme of Galatians: how shall the justified live?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme of Hebrews: faith in the promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads many to suspect Paul is the author of Hebrews. If he did not, this is an even greater miracle, because whoever wrote Hebrews unknowingly completed the trilogy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-211-3&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:1-3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD took note of Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for Sarah as He had promised. So Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him. Abraham named his son who was born to him, the son whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:23 But the son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, and the son by the free woman through the promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:11 By faith even Sarah herself received the ability to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other translations say “God remembered Sarah.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not that God forgot, but that He remembered His promise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Appointed time” = &lt;em&gt;mo’ed.&lt;/em&gt; The Jewish festivals are Moedim. Shabbat is a moed. A moed is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Isaac was born on a festival day, just as some speculate Jesus might have been born on Yom Kippur or the first day of Tabernacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either day fits – He is our atonement and he dwells/tabernacles among us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Bible uses a miraculous birth to indicate that God has set aside that child for some great purpose.” (SOM 94)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yitzhak is related to the Hebrew verb &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;צחק&lt;/span&gt;, which means to laugh, but often carries a nuanced connotation of mocking/scorning or even sexual play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’ll unpack more at verse 9.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-214-7&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:4-7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. Now Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me.” And she said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have given birth to a son in his old age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically, in an age of high infant mortality rates, eight days, an infant was considered viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac was circumcised according to the letter of the law on the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is contrasted with Ishmael, who was circumcised at age 13; he was still circumcised, but in a typological sense, not when he “should” have been according to the Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the nuanced meaning of Tzahaq, this may not necessarily be laughing in joy, but laughing in amazement. Sarah and Abraham both laughed in disbelief and perhaps mockery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac’s birth was a true miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an overarching theme in the Bible of God miraculously opening a closed womb. This extends to Mary; although she was not barren in the traditional sense, her womb was miraculously opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God made EVERYTHING in Sarah come to life – she didn’t just give birth but was able to nurse for a couple of years after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-218-10&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:8-10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. Now Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking Isaac. Therefore she said to Abraham, “Drive out this slave woman and her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not be an heir with my son Isaac!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode becomes symbolic of the affliction of the Hebrew/Jewish people throughout the ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:29 But as at that time the son who was born according to the flesh persecuted the one who was born according to the Spirit, so it is even now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:31 So then, brothers and sisters, we are not children of a slave woman, but of the free woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to some reckonings, the 400 years of suffering and affliction culminating in the exodus from Egypt begins with this affliction of Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t have much background on any tradition of a weaning feast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know who Hagar is, but the Narrator wants us to remember her as “Hagar the Egyptian.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did Ishmael do that was so bad that he and his mother had to be driven out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s this word Tzahaq again, translated as mocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Laughter can be used for good or for ill.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:8 Now it came about, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked down through a window, and saw them, and behold, Isaac was &lt;strong&gt;caressing&lt;/strong&gt; his wife Rebekah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caressing = sporting = “Tzahaqing”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael ridiculing and poking fun at his younger brother probably wouldn’t have led to the banishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael was quite possibly a sexual predator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah refuses to speak his name. Whatever it was, it had to be bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust-along-the-talmidim-way&#34;&gt;Walking In His Dust Along The Talmidim Way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;talmidim-must-drive-out-fleshly-works-and-sin-from-our-lives&#34;&gt;Talmidim must drive out fleshly works and sin from our lives.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 5:7 Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, just as you are in fact unleavened. For Christ our Passover also has been sacrificed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another theme in the Bible is the firstborn son doing something to forfeit his inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, the firstborn son receives a double portion of the father’s estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the son does something wicked, he forfeits his promise; then the next in line receives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Ishmael but Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Esau but Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Reuben (and not Simeon or Levi) but Judah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we have an especially odd situation. Joseph was the firstborn of Jacob’s favorite wife Rebekkah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judah receives the official double portion, but Joseph also receives a double portion with Ephraim and Manaesseh being adopted by Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2111-13&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:11-13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matter distressed Abraham greatly because of his son Ishmael. But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed because of the boy and your slave woman; whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her, for through Isaac your descendants shall be named. “And of the son of the slave woman I will make a nation also, because he is your descendant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:28 And you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 9:7 nor are they all children because they are Abraham’s descendants, but: “THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS SHALL BE NAMED.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:18 it was he to whom it was said, “THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS SHALL BE NAMED.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banishment of Ishmael is Abraham’s 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see here that he was reluctant and was “distressed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He loved Ishmael.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His specific tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did he trust God to take care of him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did he trust God’s promises to make Ismael a great nation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did he trust Sarah’s judgment after the last time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial of Ishmael prepared him for the final test in Genesis 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God had previously promised a great future for Ishmael, but Isaac is the one who will inherit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s curious that the Narrator added, “whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her…”. Certainly, this was not the case in Genesis 16 or Genesis 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genesis 3:17 Then to Adam He said, “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat from it’; Cursed is the ground because of you; With hard labor you shall eat from it All the days of your life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2114-16&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:14-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Abraham got up early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water, and gave them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder, and gave her the boy, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered about in the wilderness of Beersheba. When the water in the skin was used up, she left the boy under one of the bushes. Then she went and sat down opposite him, about a bowshot away, for she said, “May I not see the boy die!” And she sat opposite him, and raised her voice and wept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:24 This is speaking allegorically, for these women are two covenants: one coming from Mount Sinai giving birth to children who are to be slaves; she is Hagar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:31 So then, brothers and sisters, we are not children of a slave woman, but of the free woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern makes an interesting comment at Galatians 4:24, “Nowhere does the account in Genesis denigrate Hagar, hense there is no reason to demean the Mosaic Law on the basis of this passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the Torah or Judaism, but people who have perverted the Torah and Judaism into a legalistic system, which is equivalent to a return to slavery in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is essentially the same territory where she wandered in chapter 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned in Israel that in Abraham’s day, towns were generally situated about a day’s journey apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He outfitted her with one day’s provisions with the expectation that she would “refuel” at the next town, perhaps Beersheba 15 miles from Gerar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, she doesn’t make it and heads into the wilderness/desert south of Beersheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did she make it but was turned away because of her “status”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could she not make it that far?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps distressed, did she meander aimlessly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2117-19&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:17-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God heard the boy crying; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What is the matter with you, Hagar? Do not fear, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. “Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him by the hand, for I will make a great nation of him.” Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another significant well moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as in chapter 16, God again sees Hagar and provides materially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also reiterates His promises that Hagar had forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well was there; she just couldn’t see it. That’s a picture of us some days. We can’t open our eyes enough to see the blessing before us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Romans and Galatians, many of us have a dim view of Hagar and Ishmael – certainly, some of this is deserved and as biblical types, they represent the things that we are supposed to reject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s remember the Bible’s worst sinners are pictures of you and me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael messed up “bigly.” We mess up too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here God reaches out and offers both Hagar and Ishmael His mercy and protection. We can be critical because it doesn’t appear that this mercy had any lasting effect. One would have hoped that they could have followed the God of Abraham. We have the same choices when God shows us mercy. How often does God bail us out or see us through a tough spot only to have us forget about God a few moments later?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust-along-the-talmidim-way-1&#34;&gt;Walking In His Dust Along The Talmidim Way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;when-things-seem-hopeless-talmidim-look-for-gods-promises&#34;&gt;When things seem hopeless, talmidim look for God’s promises.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes life hits us and we lose focus. When things seem bleak and we despair, we may need to open our eyes to the goodness of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Peter 3:14-15 But even if you should suffer for righteousness&amp;rsquo; sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2120-21&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:20-21&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God was with the boy, and he grew; and he lived in the wilderness and became an archer. He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paran is in the northeastern Sinai desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This region figures prominently in the Wilderness wanderings (specifically Numbers 13, where Kadesh-Barnea is located).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-22---abrahams-10supthsup-test-the-akedah-of-isaac&#34;&gt;Genesis 22 - Abraham’s 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; test: The Akedah of Isaac&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/gen22a.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is sacred to Jews and Christians alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jews recite the 19 verses every morning as a reminder of how we endure trials that prove our character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians rightfully see this as the beloved son “dying” and being “resurrected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer of Hebrews explains the figurative language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:17-19 By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son, [18] of whom it was said, “Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.” [19] He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac as a type of Jesus will continue in chapter 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is also incredibly troubling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn’t answer the obvious question we raise in response: how could God ask this of anyone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akedah means “binding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The binding is a foreshadowing of Matthew 27:2: And they &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;bound&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; him and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate the governor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-221&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these things, God tested Abraham and said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After what things? The previous nine tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KJV has “tempt,” which is not the best rendition of Nisah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sense is a test, like in boot camp where they push you to the limit to see what you’re made of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the word in Hebrew when Jesus quotes Deuteronomy 8 “you shall not put the Lord your God to the test.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Hebrew version of the Lord’s Prayer, the line “lead me not into tempatation” is literally, “do not bring me into the hands of a test.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God would never lead us into sinful temptation, and we should pray that we never have to be tested the way Abraham was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hineini&lt;/em&gt; – a great one-word Hebrew prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I am. Behold me. Look, me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, it is used to indicate one who is ready, willing, and able to serve God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-222-3&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:2-3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.” So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac. And he cut the wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your son:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, Isaac’s name comes last&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew sages fill in the details of the discussion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your son – but I have two sons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your only/unique son – both are the only sons of their mothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yehidcha (lit. “your unique”) gets translated into Greek and Latin (e.g., church creeds) as “only begotten.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the sense is not a numeric designation but one of status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, of course, is both numerically singular and preeminent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whom you love – I love them both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Isaac – (OH!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/gen22b.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to the land&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew is “&lt;em&gt;Lech Lecha,&lt;/em&gt;” “go forth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same command God gave Abram in Genesis 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the command for the first test is, in this respect, identical to the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call of Abram culminated in the command to sacrifice Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mount Moriah is the area of Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God later directed David and Solomon to the exact same mountain to build the temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus Isaac’s offering is linked to the Temple sacrifices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Testament writers also link Jesus to these sacrifices, so we have a three-layered connection from Isaac, to the temple sacrifices, to Jesus’ once-and-for-all sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All involve the principle that the death of a righteous one provides atonement for the sins of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rose early” means Abraham didn’t hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IF Abraham is acting with the highest possible level of faith, it could be argued that he didn’t hesitate because God promised inheritance through Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God had the problem, not Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac must be resurrected for the promise to be fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wealthy Abraham even saddled his own donkey and even though over 100, he split the wood for the sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When God gives YOU a command, don’t hesitate and don’t delegate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three temptations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that Satan appeared to Abraham three times in an attempt to circumvent what he was about to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is fascinating as the Gospels record the three temptations of Jesus, each one offering Jesus a shortcut to avoid going to the Cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on the two young men as we work through the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-224&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac was “dead” to Abraham when the command came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the third day, he was “resurrected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosea 6:2 “He will revive us after two days; He will raise us up on the third day, That we may live before Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The place” becomes a proper noun. HaMakom. Jerusalem. The Place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-225&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; I and the boy will go over there and worship and come again to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How old is Isaac?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Christians imagine Isaac as a young child, perhaps around 10 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word translated as “boy,” is &lt;em&gt;naar&lt;/em&gt;, which means young lad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na’ar usually refers to a bachelor (while technically true, we don’t generally refer to 10-year-olds as bachelors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition claims Isaac was 37, which is based on Sarah’s age at Isaac’s birth and her death at 127. This is because Jewish tradition holds that Sarah’s death (described in Chapter 23) occurred due to the command to sacrifice Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While perhaps not exactly the same age, it does appear that both Isaac and Jesus were in their 30s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is going to return to the two youths?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that in this great test of faith, Abraham would knowing lie here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s more likely that he had THAT much faith that Isaac would be resurrected somehow (See Hebrews 11:17-18).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two also serve as the legally required two witnesses. If anyone needed to verify the story, they could have asked the servants who were there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-226-7&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:6-7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together. And Isaac said to his father Abraham, “My father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” He said, “Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/gen22c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;45%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Christians, this section certainly recalls Jesus making the journey to Golgotha under the weight of His cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This way of suffering is commemorated by the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem, which leads from the Antonio Fortress on the northeast side of the city to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Historically, Jesus was probably led from Pilate’s praetorium on the southwestern side of the Old City.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-228&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham said, “God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So they went both of them together..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our tour guide said, “Hebrew is cheap with words.” meaning one word can have multiple meanings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew phrase “Yireh-lo” could mean “he will see to it” or “he will provide himself.” It’s amazing that both are true here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God himself will provide the lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God will provide Himself as the lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the word for “provide” literally means “see,” God will see for Himself the lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is in the sense that when God saw the blood of the Passover lamb on the doorposts, the death angel passed over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is also deliberately connected to the Passover Lamb of God. 1 Corinthians 5:7b For Christ our Passover also has been sacrificed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Revelation, we see the Lamb as it had been slain. Revelation 5:6 “And I saw between the throne (with the four living creatures) and the elders a Lamb standing as if slaughtered, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both as one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take note when the Holy Spirit repeats something. Abraham also says “my son” twice in three verses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may wonder how an elderly Abraham coerced the younger Isaac into doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is straightforward. He didn’t coerce Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that Isaac knew about the outcome and went to the wood willingly…just like another Son did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion of a helpless child being obliviously led to his death doesn’t fit the text, and I would argue it doesn’t fit the character of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we see Isaac as a model of Jesus, we can better understand that Isaac knew what his father asked of him and did so willingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact many read this passage and conclude “God is condoning child sacrifice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposite is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pagan religions around Abraham appeared to all practice child sacrifice; but here God says, “not me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repeated instances of “they walked on together” and “my son” indicates emphasis on Abraham and Isaac’s unity. In fact &lt;em&gt;yachdav&lt;/em&gt;, “together,” means unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-229--the-binding&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:9 – the binding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we could ask whether a 100-year-old could bind a 37-year-old man against his will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the sages then ask, if Isaac was willing, why did Abraham need to bind him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the answer is that Isaac asked to be bound, lest he flinch and somehow invalidate the sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the knife had struck a non-vital area, such as a superficial wound on the arm, the ensuing sacrifice would not be “without blemish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, it was not necessary to bind Jesus, but they did so anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all the messianic parallels in this chapter aren’t enough, the very name of the chapter in Hebrew, Akedah, comes from a root word meaning striped, referring to the stripe-like marks left by the ropes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire story is named after the marks left on Isaac’s body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 53:5 (KJV) But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stripes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; we are healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages note that Abraham didn’t build &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt; alter there; he built &lt;em&gt;THE&lt;/em&gt; altar there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This becomes the altar of the Temple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2210-12--the-resurrection&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:10-12 – the “resurrection”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son. But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” He said, “Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him, for now, I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if Abraham had said, “not now, I’m busy”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hineni!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:19 (NASB) He considered that God is able to raise people even from the dead, from which he also received him back as a type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Writer to Hebrews was quoting a well-known tradition that Isaac died (some say literally) and was resurrected on the Altar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Torah Isaac did not die but often, these traditions, though seemingly fanciful, contain greater truths and insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Hebrews quotes this indicates the legend was well-known throughout the Jewish communities, which of course spread to the gentile churches. This should not surprise us as the early church leaders were all Jewish and would have passed on this and many other Jewish teachings that tie together Old Testament events with the life, death, and resurrection of Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2213-14--the-substitute&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:13-14 – the substitute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son. So Abraham called the name of that place, “The LORD will provide”; as it is said to this day, “On the mount of the LORD it shall be provided.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Y—H Yireh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Literally, “the LORD sees”, but in the sense of “he will see to it,” i.e., “provide.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It SHALL BE provided?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like it should say “The LORD provided,” but the verb is imperfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did Abraham know that this procedure acted out the prophecy in advance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t know for sure but it seems logical that when Jesus said, “Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day. He saw it and was glad” (John 8:56), namely the multiple references to “see,” Jesus was referring to this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ram also suggests a substitutionary offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and I are in Isaac’s shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We deserve death but God provides himself (literally), just as Abraham said in verse 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that the horns from Isaac’s ram that will herald the coming of the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2215-18&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:15-18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven and said, “By myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies, and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 6:13-15 For when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear an oath by no one greater, He swore by Himself, [14] saying, “INDEED I WILL GREATLY BLESS YOU AND I WILL GREATLY MULTIPLY YOU.” [15] And so, having patiently waited, he obtained the promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:12 Therefore even from one man, and one who was as good as dead at that, there were born descendants who were just as the stars of heaven in number, and as the innumerable grains of sand along the seashore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angel of the Lord begins the conversation but the words are God’s himself, so much that there is no distinction between the angel of the LORD and the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 10:30 “I and the Father are one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham passes this greatest test and the promise of offspring is reiterated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust-along-the-talmidim-way-2&#34;&gt;Walking In His Dust Along The Talmidim Way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;talmidim-can-expect-our-faith-to-be-tested&#34;&gt;Talmidim can expect our faith to be tested&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster writes, “Real faith requires real faithfulness. Real faith results in obedience. Every time we obey God, we prove our faithfulness.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three phases of Salvation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justification phase of salvation: one-time, yielding to Jesus as our savior. He does all the work. We simply cease resisting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctification phase of salvation: everything after that until you die that proves your justification is genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glorification phase of salvation: everything after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the same way a potter does not (bother to) test defective pots, but only sound vessels, the Holy One, blessed be He, does not test the wicked but only the righteous” (Genesis Rabbah 55:2).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his famous passage containing “faith without works is dead” (James 2:17), James, the brother of Jesus, used this story of Abraham as his proof text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James 2:20-24 But are you willing to acknowledge, you foolish person, that faith without works is useless? Was our father Abraham not justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected; and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “AND ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS,” and he was called a friend of God. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2219&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham lived at Beersheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who returned to the young men?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The casual reader concludes, rather obviously, Abraham AND ISAAC came down from the mountain, rejoined the two young men and returned to Beersheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not what the text says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac will not appear again until Genesis 24:62, when he meets Rebekkah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The son is sacrificed by the father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The son is “resurrected” (according to Hebrews).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The son “disappears” until he is united with his bride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you mean to tell me…? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2220-24&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:20-24&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now after these things it was told to Abraham, “Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor: Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” (Bethuel fathered Rebekah.) These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham&amp;rsquo;s brother. Moreover, his concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;we-need-to-look-beyond&#34;&gt;We need to look beyond&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a spiritual perspective, at some level Abraham knew that the promises to make him a great nation probably would not be achieved during his earthly lifetime.  He knew that God&amp;rsquo;s promises looked beyond death into the next age.  The same is true for us!&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-covenantal-obligation&#34;&gt;A Covenantal Obligation?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many respects, the Akedah cannot be completely understood without the lends of the New Testament that clarifies Abraham and Isaac was an act of prophecy that pointed to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster includes something extraordinary from Jewish tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A covenant is a two-way street,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first party can’t ask the second to do something the first person would not do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Abraham demonstrated his willingness to offer Isaac, the ball was now in God’s court to perform and reciprocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Abraham’s willing sacrifice asked for an equal show of covenant devotion from the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sacrifice of Isaac not only foreshadowed the sacrifice of Yeshua, IT DEMANDED IT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;messianic-parallels&#34;&gt;Messianic Parallels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Isaac from Bible and Jewish Tradition&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Jesus from Bible&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Exact likeness to his father Abraham.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“He who has seen me has seen the Father.” (John 14:9)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Promised son of the covenant with Abraham.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Promised Son of the covenant with Abraham and David&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A miraculous conception.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A miraculous conception.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Long awaited fulfillment of God’s promise.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Long awaited fulfillment of biblical prophecies.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sacrificed in Jerusalem by his father.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Suffered and died in Jerusalem by the will of His father.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Willingly complied.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Willingly complied.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Thirty six or thirty-seven years old.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;In His 30’s, possibly thirty-six.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Temple service later instituted on merit of Isaac’s sacrifice.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Temple service foreshadows suffering and atonement of Yeshua.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Resurrection on the third day&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Resurrection on the third day.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sacrifice atones for Jewish people.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sacrifice atones for all sinners.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tempted by Satan three times.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tempted by Satan three times.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isaac carried the wood.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jesus carried His cross.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Blood of Isaac foreshadowed Passover lamb.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Blood of Messiah invoked the blood of the Passover lamb.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yachdav&lt;/em&gt; – United in will and purpose with his father.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“Not my will but yours be done” (Luke 22:42).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Bruised on his wrists and ankles by the ropes.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Scarred on His wrists and ankles by the nails.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On the merit of Isaac’s resurrection, the Jewish dead are raised.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On the merit of Jesus’ resurrection, the dead are raised.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;God kept His covenant with Abraham because Abraham did not withhold his son.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Abraham’s faithfulness required God not to withhold His son, extending Abraham’s covenants to those who are grafted into Abraham.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
