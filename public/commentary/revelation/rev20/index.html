<h2 id="revelation-20">Revelation 20</h2>
<small>
<p>Next, I saw an angel coming down from heaven, who had the key to the Abyss and a great chain in his hand. He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan [the Adversary], and chained him up for a thousand years. He threw him into the Abyss, locked it, and sealed it over him; so that he could not deceive the nations anymore until the thousand years were over. After that, he has to be set free for a little while. Then I saw thrones, and those seated there received authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for testifying about Yeshua and proclaiming the Word of God, also those who had not worshipped the beast or its image and had not received the mark on their foreheads and on their hands. They came to life and ruled with the Messiah for a thousand years. (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were over.) This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is anyone who has a part in the first resurrection; over him, the second death has no power. On the contrary, they will be cohanim of God and of the Messiah, and they will rule with him for the thousand years.</p>
<p>When the thousand years are over, the Adversary will be set free from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for the battle. Their number is countless as the sand on the seashore, and they came up over the breadth of the Land and surrounded the camp of God&rsquo;s people and the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and consumed them. The Adversary who had deceived them was hurled into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.</p>
<p>Next, I saw a great white throne and the One sitting on it. Earth and heaven fled from his presence, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, both great and small, standing in front of the throne. Books were opened, and another book was opened, the Book of Life, and the dead were judged from what was written in the books, according to what they had done. The sea gave up the dead in it, and Death and Sh&rsquo;ol gave up the dead in them, and they were judged, each according to what he had done. Then Death and Sh&rsquo;ol were hurled into the lake of fire. This is the second death&mdash;the lake of fire. Anyone whose name was not found written in the Book of Life was hurled into the lake of fire.</p>

<h3 id="the-millennium-eschatology-review">The Millennium: Eschatology Review</h3>
<ul>
<li>Here we encounter the Millennium, the thousand-year reign of Christ.</li>
<li>Scholars over the centuries have debated whether this is literal or figurative. This debate results in the fundamental division in eschatology (the study of end times).</li>
<li>Amillennialism
<ul>
<li>Augustine (mid 4th Century) held that the Millennium was symbolic of the present age, not a literal time period.</li>
<li>Amillennial is the term we give to this body of thought.</li>
<li>In general, this view says that Jesus isn&rsquo;t literally coming back to earth; He&rsquo;s going to rule in our hearts as the church makes the world a better and better place.</li>
<li>Amillennialism sees chapter 20 as summarizing all the events in the preceding chapters versus describing a distinct chronological period.</li>
<li>Cynically, we can trace this belief to the fact that he lived during the time of Constantine when the church was married to the world (see our discussion on the letter to Pergamos).
<ul>
<li>Since the church was the ruling and governing authority, it sure would have been politically incorrect to say that Jesus is coming back to rid the world of its evil rulers!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Missler believes the two most significant shortcomings of the Protestant reformation are that first, they did not reassess the Church&rsquo;s position concerning Israel (as discussed in Romans 9-11), and second, they did not reassess the Church&rsquo;s position on Amillennialism.</li>
<li>As a result, Calvin and Luther were staunch Amillennialists, and most protestants and Catholics hold an Amillennial theology.</li>
<li>As a result, most denominations have very little use for the Book of Revelation, which is generally viewed as a protracted fable of good vs. evil.</li>
<li>To them, the warnings in Rev 22:18-19 about not adding or removing anything from the book of <em>prophecy</em> might be especially chilling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A literal millennium
<ul>
<li>In contrast, men who lived before Constantine, during times of persecution, such as Irenaeus and Justin Martyr, viewed Revelation as prophetic of events that will occur in the future.</li>
<li>In other words, there will be a literal reign of Jesus, albeit with some debate over whether the &ldquo;1000 years&rdquo; is literal or figurative for &ldquo;a long time.&rdquo;</li>
<li>We could call these &ldquo;Millenialists&rdquo; as opposed to Amillennialists.</li>
<li>There were groups divided into whether Jesus was coming before the Millennium (i.e., premillennialists) or after (i.e., postmillennialists).
<ul>
<li>Postmillennialists are rare these days.</li>
<li>This view tends to be a hybrid of premillennialism and amillennialism, with the millennium as the present historical age, which gets better and better until Jesus returns.</li>
<li>By contrast, most conservative scholars are premillennial</li>
<li>Premillennials are further divided on when they believe the rapture will occur.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>See the summary chart below from Chuck Missler.</li>

</p>
<p>Interestingly, while one&rsquo;s belief in the end-times may seem like a non-essential matter &ndash; after all, we can live our life here, and God will take care of the details after we pass &ndash; there is a connection between one&rsquo;s eschatology and one&rsquo;s hermeneutics (how one interprets the Bible.)</p>
<p>We closed lesson 18 with Luke 1:32-33 and the promise to Mary that Jesus would sit on the throne of his father David forever. This throne did not exist during Mary&rsquo;s day and does not exist today. If one is Amillennial, he or she is asserting the throne will never exist because Jesus doesn&rsquo;t literally reign. If we take the Bible seriously, we realize that the Davidic covenant was promised to David in 2 Sam 7:11-16 and Isaiah 7:13. It was continuously reaffirmed, promised to Mary, and recognized by the First Church Council in Acts 15:15-18. Act 15:15-18</p>
<ul>
<li><small>And with this, the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written, [16] &ldquo;&lsquo;After this I will return, and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen; I will rebuild its ruins, and I will restore it, [17] that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles who are called by my name, says the Lord, who makes these things [18] known from of old.&rsquo;</small></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evidence for Premilliannialism</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are 1845 references to a future Messianic Ruler in the Hebrew Bible and 318 references in the New Testament.</li>
<li>For every prophecy of Jesus&rsquo; 1st Coming, there are eight of His 2nd Coming.</li>
<li>In the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, we pray &ldquo;Thy Kingdom Come&rdquo;; are we serious when we pray this?</li>
<li>Many Jewish texts describe a period that bridges the present age with the age to come. Most view this as a period of messianic peace.
<ul>
<li>A few early traditions view the millennium as the last of seven 1000-year periods.</li>
<li>In other words, 6000 years of man&rsquo;s rule followed by 1000 years of Messiah&rsquo;s rule.</li>
<li>In this sense, it is a Sabbath rest: 6000 years shall we toil; 1000 years shall we rest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Amillennial theology would deny all of these.</em></p>
<h3 id="connection-with-ezekiel">Connection with Ezekiel</h3>
<p>Chapters 20 and 21 seem to correlate with the final chapters of Ezekiel:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Israel&rsquo;s resurrection; David ruling &ndash; Ezekiel 36-37 &ndash; Rev 20:1-6</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The war with Gog and Magog &ndash; Ezekiel 38-39 &ndash; Rev 20:7-10</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The New Jerusalem&rsquo;s temple &ndash; Ezekiel 40-48 &ndash; Rev 21-22</p>
<ul>
<li>Some see this temple as being the Millennial Temple</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="warning-and-encouragement-from-peter-on-the-last-days">Warning and encouragement from Peter on the Last Days</h3>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t appear Peter was Amillennial:</p>
<p><small>2Pe 3:3-13 knowing this first of all, that scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing, following their own sinful desires. [4] They will say, &ldquo;Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation.&rdquo; [5] For they deliberately overlook this fact, that the heavens existed long ago, and the earth was formed out of water and through water by the word of God, [6] and that by means of these, the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished. [7] But by the same word, the heavens and earth that now exist are stored up for fire, being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly. [8] But do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord, one day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day. [9] The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish but that all should reach repentance. [10] But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed. [11] Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of people ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness, [12] waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set on fire and dissolved, and the heavenly bodies will melt as they burn! [13] But according to his promise, we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.</small></p>

<p>Rev 9:1-3 And the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star fallen from heaven to earth, and he was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit.

<li>Stern inserts &ldquo;the rest of the dead&rdquo; as a parenthetical phrase to refer to the wicked who are not part of the first resurrection. Keener also interprets the passage this way.

<p>In putting it all together, everyone involved with the first resurrection reigns with Him for 1000 years; therefore, the &ldquo;rest of the dead&rdquo; who are not raised until after the 1000 years (in verse 5) can&rsquo;t be part of the first resurrection.</p>

<p>We aren&rsquo;t told why Satan is released. From our perspective, his list of charges should be adequate to secure a conviction.</p>

<p>Perhaps like in Job 1, Satan argues, &ldquo;of course, people follow you in the Millennium because you don&rsquo;t give them a choice not to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To phrase the above slightly differently, those who are alive (not resurrected) during the Millennium do not have the opportunity to accrue merit when Satan is bound.</p>

<p>While it appears that all flesh would be wiped out in the tribulation, some commentators contend there will be folks living at that time who will make it into the Millennium. These are the people who end up being deceived in the end.</p>
