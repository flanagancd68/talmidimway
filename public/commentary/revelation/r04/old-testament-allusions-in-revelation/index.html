<p>There is approximately a 2:1 ratio of Old Testament allusions (404 verses in Revelation and over 800 allusions).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>There are also several other Old and New Testament cross-references.  While John was certainly familiar with the other Gospels and perhaps some of Paul&rsquo;s writings, keep in mind there was not a &ldquo;New Testament&rdquo; as we think of it when John received the Revelation.</p>
