&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;This is the revelation which God gave to Yeshua the Messiah, so that he could show his servants what must happen very soon. He communicated it by sending his angel to his servant Yochanan,  2.  who bore witness to the Word of God and to the testimony of Yeshua the Messiah, as much as he saw.  3.  Blessed are the reader and hearers of the words of this prophecy, provided they obey the things written in it! For the time is near!  4.  From: Yochanan To: The seven Messianic communities in the province of Asia: Grace and shalom to you from the One who is, who was and who is coming; from the sevenfold Spirit before his throne;  5.  and from Yeshua the Messiah, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead and the ruler of the earth&amp;rsquo;s kings. To him, the one who loves us, who has freed us from our sins at the cost of his blood,  6.  who has caused us to be a kingdom, that is, cohanim for God, his Father—to him be the glory and the rulership forever and ever. Amen.  7.  Look! He is coming with the clouds! Every eye will see him, including those who pierced him; and all the tribes of the Land will mourn him. Yes! Amen!  8.  &amp;ldquo;I am the &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;Z,&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; says Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, the One who is, who was and who is coming.  9.  I, Yochanan, am a brother of yours and a fellow-sharer in the suffering, kingship and perseverance that come from being united with Yeshua. I had been exiled to the island called Patmos for having proclaimed the message of God and borne witness to Yeshua.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to our series on the book of Revelation we call &amp;ldquo;Revelation Backgrounds.&amp;rdquo;  In this introductory episode, we will provide an introduction to the book, some background into Jewish Apocalyptic literature, and we&amp;rsquo;ll provide what we see are Seven Keys to Interpretation.  Revelation can be a complex book, but these keys will help assure we get started on the right path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SfuWhCybaYU&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;revelation-not-revelations&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Revelation&amp;rdquo; (not &amp;ldquo;Revelations&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In his course on Jerusalem, Dr. Cargill said, &amp;ldquo;the name of the book is &amp;lsquo;RevelationnnnnnNUH,&#39;&amp;rdquo; he said to emphasize the singular&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He continued, &amp;ldquo;This is a pet peeve of mine. If you call it &amp;lsquo;RevelationS,&amp;rsquo; it means you have never read the 1st verse, and I will flunk you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, we won&amp;rsquo;t flunk anybody, but this is a good reminder that the correct name of the book is not &amp;ldquo;Revelation&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;rdquo; but &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Revelation.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-apocalyptic-literature&#34;&gt;What is &amp;ldquo;Apocalyptic Literature&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We often think of an apocalypse as some cataclysmic event involving worldwide destruction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the Greek word &lt;em&gt;apokalupsis&lt;/em&gt;, apocalypse means &amp;ldquo;revealing&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;unveiling.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specifically, we would say an unveiling of something not previously known, which wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be known were it not for divine intervention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the days of John, there was a significant body of Jewish apocalyptic literature that he and much of his audience would have known&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The general flow of apocalyptic literature:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A person in a &amp;ldquo;spiritual state,&amp;rdquo; such as fasting and praying, is caught up to a realm usually unseen by mortals (possibly physically or possibly by way of a vision).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is given a tour, usually guided by an angel, where he sees heavenly worship services, God&amp;rsquo;s throne, and various hallowed chambers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He also sometimes sees &amp;ldquo;the war behind the war.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, when there is a physical war on earth, the person gets to witness a corresponding unseen spiritual warfare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then he gets to witness a final climactic battle between the forces of good and evil and resulting judgments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often, the things the person with the vision sees are nearly impossible to put into words
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best he can do is use the best words he can,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because the human is trying to explain the inexplicable, we end up with the extreme symbolism, such as beasts doing strange things (Daniel 7:5-6) and objects that seem to defy the laws of physics (Ezekiel 1:16-20)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The general purpose of an Apocalypse is for God to reassure His people to remain faithful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster summarizes a biblical apocalypse like this:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Although things on earth seem terribly unjust, with the righteous suffering and the wicked prospering, a day is coming where God will pour out his wrath upon the wicked and reward the righteous.&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, &amp;ldquo;your faith and suffering are not in vain.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;The Apocalypse of Paul?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know Paul (or a man he knew) had an Apocalypse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Corinthians 12:2-4: &amp;ldquo;I know a man in Messiah (whether in the body I don&amp;rsquo;t know, or whether out of the body I don&amp;rsquo;t know—God knows)—fourteen years ago, he was caught up to the third heaven. I know such a man (whether in the body or outside of the body I don&amp;rsquo;t know—God knows)— he was caught up into Paradise and heard words too sacred to tell, which a human is not permitted to utter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a classic apocalyptic vision. Were it not for the &amp;ldquo;gag order,&amp;rdquo; we might have had not one but two Books titled &amp;ldquo;Revelation&amp;rdquo;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;seven-keys-to-interpretation&#34;&gt;Seven Keys to Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Revelation is perhaps the most studied but least understood book in the New Testament.&amp;rdquo; – Daniel Lancaster&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our primary challenge with understanding Revelation, or just about any other book of the Bible, is that we are separated from the original intended audience in three critical areas: time, distance, and most importantly, culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/49f033022fe7e954bd6946926032fbc0.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time – John recorded these events nearly 2000 years ago, and he often references writings written hundreds of years before that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distance – Turkey, the geographic setting for Revelation 2-3, is over 6000 nautical miles away from the central United States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Culture
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setting is a Jewish author writing to Jews and gentile God-fearers in the diaspora (Jews living outside the Land of Israel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These early believers knew their Scriptures, what we would call the &amp;ldquo;Old Testament,&amp;rdquo; much better than we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These believers brought a very different set of experiences, assumptions, and expectations than we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These areas may be less familiar to us if our context is western Protestant Christianity and we have never traveled to these lands. To bridge these gaps, our study in Revelation Backgrounds synthesizes several published commentaries that focus on the historical, geographic, and cultural (specifically Jewish) aspects of the Bible. We also consult Bible atlases, travel videos, and occasionally extra-biblical documents and pertinent archeologic findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In keeping with the pattern of &amp;ldquo;sevens&amp;rdquo; in Revelation, we have seven &amp;ldquo;Keys to Interpretation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-follow-the-talmidim-way&#34;&gt;#1 Follow the &amp;ldquo;Talmidim Way&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Talmidim&lt;/em&gt; is the Hebrew word for &amp;ldquo;disciples.&amp;rdquo; I am a &lt;em&gt;talmid&lt;/em&gt;. You are a &lt;em&gt;talmid&lt;/em&gt;. We are all &lt;em&gt;Talmidim&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talmidim was one of the first Hebrew words I ever learned, so it has a special place in my heart. The word is symbolic of a journey I&amp;rsquo;ve been on for over ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an expression that ancient Jewish disciples would follow their rabbi so closely that they would be &amp;ldquo;covered in his dust.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/547b202d55681e683cc9dab7b8528db4.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;33%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, I call the ministry the &lt;em&gt;Talmidim Way&lt;/em&gt;. Our logo contains a drawing of an ancient stone footpath to remind us that our faith is founded on old ways, and we should walk in the dust of our Rabbi Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Keener is one of my go-to commentators for historical context. He says much more eloquently, &amp;ldquo;Shedding light on the original provides modern readers better access to the message of the book when they seek to apply it today.&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-be-open-to-the-spirits-leading&#34;&gt;#2 Be open to the Spirit&amp;rsquo;s leading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us not cling too tightly to any presupposed interpretation or application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My positions on Revelation have changed over the years (see &amp;ldquo;we reserve the right to get smarter&amp;rdquo; callout)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to dive into the text, leverage the wisdom of trustworthy commentators who have gone before us, check everything out against Scripture&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and let the Spirit pour into us.
&lt;img src=&#34;images/dove.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may mean we need to leave behind a previously held position&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider yourself lucky if you do not already have a firm position on &amp;ldquo;pretribulation,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;preterist,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;postmillennial.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More division than edification occurs over these subjects, in my opinion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s ok to hold firm views, but remember we are all brothers and sisters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can and should debate and challenge; Proverbs 27:17 says, &amp;ldquo;As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let us never divide over these types of matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;We reserve the right to get smarter.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I admittedly am looking at myself when I say not to cling too tightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other times I&amp;rsquo;ve studied Revelation from end to end, I&amp;rsquo;ve been rather staunchly in the &amp;ldquo;futurist, pre-tribulation&amp;rdquo; camp. That means that my view of Revelation tended to be that after chapter 4, everything that happened was yet future (futurist). Before this happened, all the faithful believers would be raptured before the tribulation (pretribulation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, particularly after digging into the Gospels context and other things, I&amp;rsquo;m no longer 100% sold on that approach. Also, if we look at Jesus&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;one will be taken and the other left&amp;rdquo; statements and in the parables where all the fish are hauled in, but then some are removed, it&amp;rsquo;s not the good who are removed. It&amp;rsquo;s the wicked who are removed. It&amp;rsquo;s the rotten fish that are thrown back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not saying definitively that the pretribulation view is wrong. Only that now, my opinions are more flexible after further review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to have a colleague who liked to say, &amp;ldquo;we always reserve the right to get smarter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-be-a-berean-acts-1711&#34;&gt;#3 be a Berean (Acts 17:11)!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will begin every study with Acts 17:11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These (Bereans) were more noble than those in Thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so. (Acts 17:11 KJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 17:11 is paramount for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every other commentator and I are human. I will, of course, make every attempt to be faithful and reliable. Still, we all have our biases, blind spots, and mistaken conclusions.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I assert a fact, I will try to back it up with a citation. When I offer an opinion or speculation, I will try to disclose that also. After each lesson, I will include a list of works cited. I encourage everyone to never take my word for it but validate what I say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acts 17:11 tells us the Biblical model is to &amp;ldquo;trust but verify.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is up to the reader to do your research and verify that any facts and conclusions are scriptural.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all called to &amp;ldquo;be Bereans.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-understand-the-intended-audience&#34;&gt;#4 Understand the intended audience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bible, including the Book of Revelation, was written FOR us but not TO us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are operating under the assumption that the Apostle John wrote Revelation, likely between 90-95 CE&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He was instructed to share it with seven specific Messianic communities/congregations.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note we should not say &amp;ldquo;seven churches&amp;rdquo; because no such thing as a &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; existed in 95.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reason for the apocalypse was to provide hope for the faithful during the intense persecution of the Roman Emperor Domitian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Bible is written &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; us in the sense of 2 Timothy 3:16-17. All Scripture is inspired by God and useful &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; teaching, &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; reproof, &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; restoration, and &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; training in righteousness, 17. so that the person belonging to God may be capable, fully equipped &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; every good deed.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teaching/doctrine = what &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reproof = what is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restoration/correction = how to &lt;strong&gt;get&lt;/strong&gt; right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Training in righteousness/instruction = how to &lt;strong&gt;stay&lt;/strong&gt; right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-understand-revelation-is-a-jewish-book&#34;&gt;#5 Understand Revelation is a Jewish book&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revelation is a Jewish book. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s really Jewish. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s the most Jewish book in our New Testament&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This fact is why we as Gentiles often have trouble understanding Revelation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The symbolism can be baffling since we likely won&amp;rsquo;t have the background in the Hebrew Scriptures that John&amp;rsquo;s original audience had.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are 404 verses in Revelation, but there are allusions to over 800 Old Testament verses. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, John never directly quotes any other verse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Psalms, and Deuteronomy are frequently alluded to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation 1:3 promises a blessing for those who hear and obey what has been written.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the exact nature of the blessing is not stated, a thorough study of Revelation will take us into nearly every other book of the Bible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a blessing when we study God&amp;rsquo;s word. The Jewish sages see Bible study as worship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proverbs 3:13-14: Happy (blessed) is the man who finds wisdom and the man who gains understanding. For her trade-value is better than silver, and her yield better than fine gold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will call attention to many of these references as we go verse-by-verse through Revelation Backgrounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewish imagery is everywhere: Jewish prophecy, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Sukkot, Palm Branches, Shofars, Menorahs, books of judgment, the Book of Life, liturgical functions and ceremonies about the Temple in Jerusalem, etc.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We assume that John wrote this between 90-95 CE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is significant as it would have been &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the Roman destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John drew from a time in Israel&amp;rsquo;s history where a nearly identical event happened: the destruction of the First Temple in 586 BCE by the Babylonians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing this allows us to frame John&amp;rsquo;s references to Babylon in their proper context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we approach Revelation and ignore its Jewishness, we will find it difficult, if not impossible, to understand.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But if we are Bereans and search the Scriptures, we will discover Revelation significantly demystified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For this reason, we will be presenting verses from Revelation and other books from the &amp;ldquo;Complete Jewish Bible&amp;rdquo; (CJB).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CJB is a translation by Dr. David H. Stern that seeks to &amp;ldquo;present the Bible (Old and New Testaments) as a complete Jewish book and connect readers with the Jewishness of the Messiah.&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It also seeks to correct anachronisms, such as the label &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; in the New Testament before such an entity ever existed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-be-suspicious-if-an-interpretation-could-not-have-occurred-to-the-original-audience&#34;&gt;#6 Be suspicious if an interpretation could not have occurred to the original audience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If an interpretation would not or could not have occurred to John or his audience, we will treat it with a degree of healthy suspicion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The historical aspect tends to get the least attention from other Protestant-based commentators.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, how the events described in Revelation relate to what was happening in John&amp;rsquo;s Day will be our primary focus with Revelation Backgrounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many interpretations may appear to &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo;; they just may not fit within our scope. We want to stay focused on the 1st-century context as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Healthy suspicion doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we reject it outright just because it was beyond the scope of the original audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is perfectly capable of delivering a message that is just as relevant for us as it was to the original audience.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, the &amp;ldquo;seven letters&amp;rdquo; have many layers of understanding and application (admittedly, some are concrete while others are speculative).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no reason why multiple layers of interpretation can&amp;rsquo;t be correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;7-acknowledge-that-fear-is-not-from-god&#34;&gt;#7 Acknowledge that fear is not from God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear is not from God&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fear not,&amp;rdquo; or an equivalent, is one of the most frequently repeated commands in the Bible.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Mathew 10:28, Jesus said the only fear we should have is the fear of God, a healthy fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Far too many approach Revelation with a spirit of fear; may it not be so with us!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We must always apply &amp;ldquo;Acts 17:11 logic&amp;rdquo; to any potential interpretation.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the given interpretation consistent with the rest of the Scriptures?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does it magnify Yeshua (Jesus) the Messiah?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does it give us a spirit of peace?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we are left fearful of anyone or anything besides God, then the interpretation/application is not from God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;no-fear-means-avoiding-frontpage-exegesis&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;No Fear&amp;rdquo; means avoiding &amp;ldquo;Frontpage Exegesis&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media loves fear. Fear sells. If it bleeds, it leads. Yet we just said that fear is not from God. Fear should not be a factor in our attempts to understand Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Exegesis&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracting concepts from the biblical text while applying reasonable academic inquiry techniques&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&amp;ldquo;Frontpage&amp;rdquo; Exegesis&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing every sensational headline or significant current as a fulfillment of biblical prophecy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation is NOT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A crystal ball to predict the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A description of current events in the 21st century&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A chronological, linear sequence of end-time events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A literal narrative, but neither is it an allegory
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember this: &lt;strong&gt;Revelation is not an allegory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frontpage exegesis intentionally or unintentionally allegorizes Scripture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem with an allegory is that we can twist it to mean anything we want it to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For context, if we were to study Christian writings during WWI, a large segment of Christians believed they were living in the days of Revelation. Some even quit their jobs, stopped having children, and even committed suicide.
&lt;img src=&#34;images/frontpage_exegesis.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;20%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During WWII, many thought Hitler was the Antichrist (not entirely without reason).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1988, one person was &lt;em&gt;so sure&lt;/em&gt; the rapture was going to occur that year, he published a book, &amp;ldquo;88 Reasons Why the Rapture will be in 1988,&amp;rdquo; and then had the audacity to say &amp;ldquo;if I&amp;rsquo;m wrong, the Bible is wrong.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over the last decade, the Beast was &amp;ldquo;obviously&amp;rdquo; Donald Trump or Barack Obama, depending on your political viewpoint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone throughout history who has claimed that he or she was living out the events prophesied by Revelation has been wrong. That&amp;rsquo;s the problem with Frontpage Exegesis. It&amp;rsquo;s always been wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; fair to say, &amp;ldquo;Revelation describes literal events using signs/symbolic language.&amp;rdquo; We&amp;rsquo;ll talk more about some of these signs below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;revelation-metadata&#34;&gt;Revelation &amp;ldquo;metadata&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s look at the &amp;ldquo;who, what, when, where&amp;rdquo; of Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;who-wrote-revelation&#34;&gt;Who wrote Revelation?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 1:1-2 This is the Revelation which God gave to Yeshua the Messiah so that he could show his servants what must happen very soon. He communicated it by sending his angel to his servant &lt;mark&gt;Yochanan (John)&lt;/mark&gt;, 2. who bore witness to the Word of God and to the testimony of Yeshua the Messiah, as much as he saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note the progression of transmission: God → Jesus → His angel/messenger → John → Jesus&amp;rsquo; servants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ultimate Author is God
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation is not just &amp;ldquo;divinely inspired&amp;rdquo; but is &amp;ldquo;divinely given.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divinely inspired – the Holy Spirit guided the words, but the structure, choice of words, what aspects to include, what to omit, and other stylistic details were at the discretion of the human author&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divinely given – the words, what to include/omit, and so forth came directly from God. The human author was primarily a transcriber and copy editor
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation is the only New Testament book that is divinely given; all others are divinely-inspired&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the Torah, the first five books of Moses, are divinely given (The phrase, &amp;ldquo;The LORD spoke to Moses and said, &amp;lsquo;Thus shall you say to the Children of Israel…&#39;&amp;rdquo; appears frequently.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John wrote down the words of the angel/messenger unless he was told not to (Revelation 10:4)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While we can&amp;rsquo;t prove it beyond all doubt, the evidence is convincing that Revelation&amp;rsquo;s (human) author is John the Apostle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, the author is John, the &lt;em&gt;talmid&lt;/em&gt; (disciple) of Yeshua, the author of the Gospel of John, and the three epistles that bear his name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One additional piece of evidence is the phrase &amp;ldquo;bore witness.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This type of legal/courtroom terminology is all over the Gospel of John.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John presents evidence that Yeshua/Jesus is the rightful authority for Israel and the good shepherd. In addition, John also bears witness that the Jerusalem religious establishment is unauthorized and its leaders are the &amp;ldquo;bad shepherds&amp;rdquo; over Israel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;when-and-where-was-revelation-written&#34;&gt;When and where was Revelation written?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 1:9 I, John, your brother and fellow partaker with you in the tribulation and kingdom and patient endurance that are in Yeshua, was on &lt;mark&gt;the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Yeshua&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/e45914e26cc0be101f69fd4d54a746be.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iraneus, the earliest source who cited the Apostle John as the author, also stated that he wrote during the worldwide persecution of Jews and Christians of Emperor Domitian. Domitian was also responsible for exiling John to Patmos.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The small island of Patmos is about 7.5 miles (12 km) long from north to south and at its widest is 6 miles (10 km) from east to west.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian was the Roman Emperor from 81-96.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most conservative scholars believe Revelation was written between 90-95.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    For information on exactly how John ended up in Patmos &amp;ldquo;because of the Word of God and Testimony of Yeshua,&amp;rdquo; see our Revelation Backgrounds Supplement &amp;ldquo;Historical Background of John&amp;rsquo;s Exile.&amp;rdquo;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-was-revelation-written&#34;&gt;How was Revelation written?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 1:1b: He &lt;mark&gt;communicated it&lt;/mark&gt; by sending His angel to His servant Yochanan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Greek word for &amp;ldquo;communicated it&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;made it known&amp;rdquo; is &lt;em&gt;σημαίνω&lt;/em&gt; to signify, literally &amp;ldquo;render into signs.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We might say &amp;ldquo;encoded.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missler writes, &amp;ldquo;Revelation is in code, but every code is explained elsewhere in Scripture!&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every sign in the Bible points to something – in the case of Revelation, the signs point to the climax of God&amp;rsquo;s plan for Man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Readers familiar with the Old Testament would have understood what these signs represented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will get more comfortable with John&amp;rsquo;s communication as we dig into the Hebrew Scriptures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sevens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another way Revelation is &amp;ldquo;signified&amp;rdquo; is through repetitive patterns, specifically the number seven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sevens are conspicuous in Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In biblical thought, seven is the number that denotes &amp;quot; completion,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;finality,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;perfection.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Shabbat (7th day) is a day of peace, joy, and rest; the Messianic Kingdom is often described as entering into the (Sabbath) peace/joy/rest of God&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This comes from Genesis 2:1-3
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So the heavens and the earth were completed along with their entire array. 2. God completed—on the seventh day—His work that He made, and He ceased—on the seventh day—from all His work that He made. 3. Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, for on it He ceased from all His work that God created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of the seven patterns are obvious (congregations, seals, trumpets, bowls), while others are less noticeable.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The depiction of Messiah in chapter 1 has seven features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each letter to a congregation in chapters 2-3 contains seven components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are seven &amp;ldquo;blessings&amp;rdquo; (or beatitudes) scattered throughout the book, beginning with the blessing to the one who reads and obeys the words at Revelation 1:3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;to-whom-was-revelation-written&#34;&gt;To whom was Revelation written?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 1:4: From: Yochanan To: The seven Messianic communities in the province of Asia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John, at the time, was over the congregation in Ephesus and had responsibility for the other six nearby assemblies: Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are circled on the map, along with John&amp;rsquo;s location on Patmos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John was tasked with shepherding his flocks through this tumultuous time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    The term &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; is an anachronism
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;images/seven_congregations.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At this point, you may be asking, &amp;ldquo;why aren&amp;rsquo;t you using the word &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo;? I thought they were the &amp;ldquo;seven churches of Revelation?&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can say with reasonable certainty that the name of the building where 1st-century believers in Asia met was called a synagogue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These communities or congregations were predominately Jewish but had their share of gentile believers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t recommend calling them &amp;ldquo;churches&amp;rdquo; because the &amp;ldquo;church,&amp;rdquo; either a building or an organizational structure, did not exist in the first century.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anachronism&lt;/strong&gt;: the misappropriation of concepts and ideas in time.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When an actor in a movie set in the Middle Ages is wearing a digital watch, or there&amp;rsquo;s a car visible on a street that is supposed to occur during the civil war, that&amp;rsquo;s an anachronism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anachronistic fallacy&lt;/strong&gt;: when one purposely or inadvertently &lt;strong&gt;asserts or infers a concept&lt;/strong&gt; based on an anachronism.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; didn&amp;rsquo;t exist yet in the first century, every time we translate &amp;ldquo;ecclesia&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; in the New Testament, that&amp;rsquo;s an anachronistic fallacy.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fact, the word &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; in any form or language doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear until around the mid-5th Century CE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Greek word &lt;em&gt;ecclesia&lt;/em&gt;, later translated as &amp;ldquo;church,&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;called out assembly,&amp;rdquo; or in a religious context, &amp;ldquo;congregation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;ecclesia&lt;/em&gt; is about people, not an institution, yet this is not what usually comes to our mind when we see the word &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; in our Bibles. We tend to associate &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;a building or collection of (non-Jewish) worshippers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John, a Jew, wrote to Jewish congregations attended by Jews and gentiles. In the early to mid 90s, they assembled in synagogues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;To whom was the revelation &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; given?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus! This has some interesting theological implications, as there were apparently things Jesus didn&amp;rsquo;t know even after his Resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 1:1 The Revelation of Yeshua the Messiah, which God gave &lt;strong&gt;Him&lt;/strong&gt; to show to His servants the things that must soon take place. He made it known by sending His angel to His servant John,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-was-revelation-written&#34;&gt;Why was Revelation written?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revelation 1:7 &lt;mark&gt;Look! He is coming with the clouds! Every eye will see him&lt;/mark&gt;, including those who pierced Him, and all the tribes of the Land will mourn him. Yes! Amen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We mentioned above how the purpose of apocalyptic literature was to give the faithful hope during times of tribulation. No matter what happens here on earth, we always have the hope of his return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zechariah 14:4 reminds us that when he returns, His &amp;ldquo;feet will stand on the Mount of Olives.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the end of the day, Revelation is about God fixing what man and Satan have messed up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whereas we saw the entrance of sin, the curse, and death in Genesis, we will see the end of sin (chapter 21), no more condemnation (chapter 22), and no more death (chapter 21).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like Steven Covey says, &amp;ldquo;Begin with the end in mind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No matter how murky or mysterious Revelation may be, ultimately, it is about the Glory of God and restoration of Man to the state that God originally intended for us in Eden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation reminds us, &amp;ldquo;victory depends on Christ&amp;rsquo;s finished work, not on human circumstances (and) that the imminent hope of His return is worth more than all the world&amp;rsquo;s goods.&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amen!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am excited to dig into this book. I&amp;rsquo;ve studied it many times, but this will be the first time diving into using messianic and other cultural background commentaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we begin, remember the &amp;ldquo;Seven Keys to Interpretation&amp;rdquo; we listed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will have a separate segment to review the relevant history before John receives the Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if history wasn&amp;rsquo;t your best subject, I encourage you to view this supplement. Understanding this extra-biblical background turns out to be highly relevant to our studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, we&amp;rsquo;ll see you for Revelation chapter 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically Jewish apocalyptic literature fall into a category called pseudopigrapha – writings falsely ascribed to someone else describing a vision that person had. For example, the Book of (First) Enoch probably dates to 200-100 BCE (long after the Biblical Enoch was taken by God in Genesis 5). Revelation follows the genre of 1 Enoch, but it is also different because we are confident it came directly from God through John the Apostle.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believers need not be bothered by the &amp;ldquo;BCE/CE&amp;rdquo; (Before Common Era/Common Era) designations in place of &amp;ldquo;BC&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;AD&amp;rdquo;. They mean the same things. Saying BCE/CE is less offensive particularly to Jewish people. It is a chance to love our neighbors and live out Romans 12:18 (&amp;ldquo;If possible, so far as it depends on you, live in &lt;em&gt;shalom&lt;/em&gt; with all people&amp;rdquo;). Besides, when the Catholic Church established the BC/AD system in the Middle Ages, they made a math error. We now know that Yeshua was most likely born 5 or 4 BCE. Saying &amp;ldquo;Jesus Christ was born in the year 5 Before Christ&amp;rdquo; is non-sensical when you think about it!&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a supplement to our Revelation background series. We&amp;rsquo;re essentially going to take a look at significant events in the period between the Jewish Revolt of 66CE, including the destruction of the Jewish Temple in 70, through the mid-90s that resulted in John&amp;rsquo;s exile on Patmos, where he received the Revelation. Even if history wasn&amp;rsquo;t your best subject in school, I think you&amp;rsquo;ll find this helpful as we prepare to study Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than Jesus predicting the temple&amp;rsquo;s destruction in Luke 21, all of this is drawn from extra-biblical sources. Much of it is verifiable from historical documents. Still, some of it is based on church tradition that was likely passed on orally before it was written down several centuries later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church father, Iraneus, was only one generation removed from John the Apostle. Iraneus in &lt;em&gt;ecclesiastical history¸&lt;/em&gt;is the earliest source that tells us that John the Apostle wrote Revelation and did so from Patmos because the Roman Emperor Domitian exiled him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domitian&amp;rsquo;s persecution turns out to be critically important if we are to put Revelation in context. The following is summarized mainly from Cargill&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Jerusalem the Holy City&lt;/em&gt; course&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and Lancaster&amp;rsquo;s series &lt;em&gt;Apocalypse of John&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Chronicles of the Apostles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The years following Jesus&#39; Resurrection and Ascension were a tumultuous time for Israel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The governors that followed Pontius Pilate went from bad to worse, as did the Herods that took over for Antipas and Phillip, notably Agrippa I and Agrippa II&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With this came increased talk of rebellion and hopes for a Messianic deliverer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In many Jew&amp;rsquo;s minds, the Messiah will deliver the people from captivity and establish a literal political kingdom, just like Moses did during the Exodus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since Jesus didn&amp;rsquo;t do that, He couldn&amp;rsquo;t be the promised deliverer&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;False messiahs were abundant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This led to what is known as the &amp;ldquo;First Jewish Revolt&amp;rdquo; in 66 CE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-jewish-revolt-nero-vespasian-and-josephus&#34;&gt;The Jewish Revolt: Nero, Vespasian, and Josephus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/3feaa830cafd78dd620f3f1cbab7887f.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;25%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 66 CE, during the time of Emperor Nero (famous for his own persecutions and insanity), there was open rebellion; a Roman General named Vespasian (pictured at right) was sent with Roman Legions V, X, and XV to quash it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josephus predicts greatness for Vespasian.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During one battle in the north of Israel, Vespasian captured a Jewish general named Yosef ben Mattiyahu, who later became known as Flavius Josephus.&lt;img src=&#34;images/408d47525f6d48efcea99f82468abd74.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;25%&#34; style=&#34;float:left&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As he was about to be executed, Josephus said to Vespasian something along the lines of, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not really a general. I&amp;rsquo;m a prophet, and one day you&amp;rsquo;re going to be the emperor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most Roman leaders were extraordinarily superstitious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naturally, what this man said was pleasing to Vespasian&amp;rsquo;s ears; therefore, Josephus was allowed to live as an enslaved person. He authored two large volumes of Jewish history up to that point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 69, while dealing with the Jewish rebellion, Vespasian was recalled to Rome, where he was indeed named emperor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josephus also told Vespasian that amid all this Jewish messianic enthusiasm, it was &lt;em&gt;Vespasian and his line&lt;/em&gt; who fulfilled the Jewish prophecies about the coming Messiah, not some Jewish person from the house of David.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After Vespasian became emperor, they took Jewish prophecies very seriously!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josephus was still very much in the picture some 10-20 years later, when Vespasian&amp;rsquo;s son Domitian took over the Roman Empire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josephus is viewed as a traitor to the Jews for his actions.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to legend, a group of generals entered into a suicide pact rather than be captured.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josephus conveniently drew the proverbial last straw and was tasked with killing the last man and then himself. He obviously took another way when he presented himself to Vespasian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vespasian&amp;rsquo;s son Titus ultimately was successful in putting down the rebellion.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 70, he besieged and sacked Jerusalem and destroyed the Temple stone-by-stone, just as Jesus had predicted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 72, he rooted out the last Jewish holdouts at a place called Masada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those Jews who were not slaughtered were forced into exile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Jews would not have a homeland to call their own until 1948.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2nd-temple-destruction-fulfills-prophecy&#34;&gt;2nd Temple Destruction Fulfills Prophecy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/60576df31e34f2c3e4538d7811953bdc.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
Luke 19:41-44 As He drew near and saw Jerusalem, He wept over her, 42. saying, &#34;If only you had recognized this day the things that lead to shalom! But now they are hidden from your eyes. 43. For the days will come upon you when your enemies will surround you with barricades and hem you in on all sides. 44. And they will smash you to the ground—you and your children within you. And they won&#39;t leave within you one stone upon another because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus&#39; words about the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple were fulfilled in 70 CE
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indeed, not one stone was left upon another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A visit to the Temple Mount area in Jerusalem today reveals these massive stones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on the indentations in the surrounding pavement, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to conclude that they fell from the top of the temple mount above (note the person in the upper left corner for a sense of the size of the stones!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archaeologists date these stones to the 1st century and the destruction of Jerusalem by the Roman army.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The destruction of the &amp;ldquo;2nd Temple&amp;rdquo; is critical in Jewish history.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The destruction of the 1st Temple in 586 BCE was another such moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In one of those quirks of history, both destructions happened on the same day on the Jewish Calendar, the 9th day of the Jewish month of Av.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since then, several calamities have happened on that date, and to this day, the 9th of Av is a day of mourning and fasting for the Jewish People.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;roman-aftermath-vespasian-and-titus&#34;&gt;Roman aftermath: Vespasian and Titus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The destruction of the Temple was a severe blow to the hopes and aspirations of Jews
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the second time in their history, God&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;chosen people&amp;rdquo; had been decimated, exiled, and seen God&amp;rsquo;s house overrun by a pagan empire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;How could an all-powerful, all-loving God let this happen? What will we do next?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first time it happened was in 586 BCE at the hands of the Babylonians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE, Emperor Vespasian did two things to teach a lesson to this rebellious people.
&lt;img src=&#34;images/41894ca448ddd5df916ab6bc1f1e5491.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
-   This tax only applied to Jews.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He imposed a &lt;em&gt;fiscus Iudaicus&lt;/em&gt; (a Jewish Tax).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a further insult, the tax went to the upkeep of the pagan Temple of Jupiter/Zeus, which stood where the Jewish Temple once did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ancient cultures, putting your holy site over someone else&amp;rsquo;s holy site was the ultimate in &amp;ldquo;smack talk&amp;rdquo;; it communicates, &amp;ldquo;your God is vanquished.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some Jews (both followers and non-followers of Yeshua) &amp;ldquo;renounced&amp;rdquo; their faith to avoid the tax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He &amp;ldquo;gave orders that everyone who belonged to the lineage of David should be sought out that none of the royal race might be left among the Jews.&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Titus succeeded Vespasian in 79 but only reigned two years before he died of a fever.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Arch of Titus&amp;rdquo; stands in Rome today as a tribute to his victory over the Jews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/61a7daa2ad04e35e37a8668a756e01d0.png&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empathy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to put ourselves in the Jew&amp;rsquo;s shoes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our God is supposed to be all-powerful with a special place in His heart for His people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet not once but twice, God&amp;rsquo;s house, the holiest place on earth, has been overrun by idol-worshipping pagans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moreover, in the case of the first temple, God made an unconditional covenant with David that appears to have been broken. What do you do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is your God not who He says He is? Maybe he&amp;rsquo;s not that powerful. Perhaps He doesn&amp;rsquo;t love us. Maybe we sinned so severely he had no choice but to break his promise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you do when what you believe to be true is so blatantly contradicted by the evidence?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you walk away from your faith? A lot did, I&amp;rsquo;m sure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you say God would have protected us, but our people were so bad they deserved it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you say that maybe we misread or misunderstood the promises?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of people did a combination of these things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psychologists use the term &amp;ldquo;cognitive dissonance&amp;rdquo; for those times when what you believe, what you have been taught all your life doesn&amp;rsquo;t match your reality. According to Cargill, this is what the Jews in exile after the destruction of the First Temple were experiencing.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And let us not be so glib as to say, &amp;ldquo;Jesus did away with the temple.&amp;rdquo; Or &amp;ldquo;the Jews rejected Jesus, so they got what was coming.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not that simple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first apostles met in the Temple every day, and the temple was also important to Paul.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Temple was a big deal to all Jews, including those who accepted Jesus as their Messiah&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of all, they mourned.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the First Temple was destroyed, we get passages like Psalms 137.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When God&amp;rsquo;s people mourn, God listens.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the first temple destruction and the people were scattered to a foreign land, the Babylon Empire, God, sent apocalyptic visions to prophets like Ezekiel and Daniel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should not surprise us that we get a similar apocalyptic vision after the second temple was destroyed and God&amp;rsquo;s people were scattered throughout the Roman empire. This time God would make it through John the Apostle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But first, we need to talk about another Nero figure named Domitian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;domitian&#34;&gt;Domitian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the short time Titus was emperor, he softened his father&amp;rsquo;s hard-line positions, particularly concerning political prisoners. Presumably, this also included an easing of enforcement efforts on the two anti-Jewish programs instituted by his father.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All that would change under Domitian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian (emperor from 81-96) reinstituted the two programs of Vespasian &amp;ldquo;with the utmost rigor&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, In Rome, worship of the imperial cult was viewed as a symbol of loyalty to the Roman state. This included worshipping a statue or image of the emperor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whereas Vespasian and Titus weren&amp;rsquo;t significantly &amp;ldquo;religious,&amp;rdquo; Domitian, by the Josephus prophecy, believed himself to be the promised one sent by the gods. He thus demanded worship while he was still alive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He set up a temple to himself and demanded to be addressed as &amp;ldquo;my master, my lord, my god, Domitian.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is in addition to Rome&amp;rsquo;s general paranoia about foreign religions, particularly those like Judaism, whose proponents denounced Rome&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster says something significant here: &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;this fantasy made him all the more worthy of the title of antichrist.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now add to the mix that numerous gentiles throughout the empire were coming to faith in Yeshua.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul and the early leadership decided that gentiles should not be required to convert to Judaism as a condition of being accepted into the assembly (see Acts 15).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The unintended consequence meant that these converts were not Jewish and didn&amp;rsquo;t have to pay the tax&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the eyes of Domitian, they had exploited what we might call &amp;ldquo;a tax loophole.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They could worship the Jewish Messiah in a Jewish congregation but still not pay the Jewish tax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian expected to find Jewish tax evaders and deal with them accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He was not expecting to find the amounts of non-Jews throughout the empire who had forsaken Roman gods to drift into Jewish ways&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The conversions, in combination with the &amp;ldquo;tax loophole&amp;rdquo; problem, sent Domitian into a rage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People in his household were even part of this strange new religion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although Judaism was a recognized religion in the empire, it was only legal for Jews to practice it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian initially turned his wrath on the Jews for aiding and abetting these non-Jews.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to him, it was their fault for spreading and proselytizing to non-Jews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He started by banishing all Jews from the city of Rome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of them naturally protested, saying, &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not all Jews! It&amp;rsquo;s this strange sect called the &amp;lsquo;Nazarenes.&amp;rsquo; Blame them!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian next initiated a system to weed out these &amp;ldquo;secret Jews&amp;rdquo; - being a &amp;ldquo;Christian&amp;rdquo; was now punishable by death&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-believing Jews were required to become informants on their messianic brethren&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specifically, Keener notes that synagogues in Asia (modern Turkey) expelled Jewish Christians.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They &lt;strong&gt;accused&lt;/strong&gt; the gentiles in messianic fellowships of &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;saying they were Jews, but were not&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a religious standpoint, these people were violating the Torah&amp;rsquo;s requirement to &amp;ldquo;Love your neighbor as yourself&amp;rdquo; (Leviticus 19:18), as even the narrowest interpretation of &amp;ldquo;neighbor&amp;rdquo; would have included Gentiles who have attached themselves as &amp;ldquo;god fearers&amp;rdquo; and worshipped in synagogues alongside Jews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Nazis were not the first to do this. The Church led the Spanish Inquisition, which also required people to inform each other.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian had the same problem Torquemada and Hitler did. Who exactly was a Jew?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian&amp;rsquo;s answer was &amp;ldquo;anyone who lived like a Jew,&amp;rdquo; which included gentile followers of Yeshua.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was the first large-scale persecutions of Christian believers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The captives had one opportunity to dispel the charges.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They had to reject their Jewish ways, then bow and worship an image of the emperor and acknowledge that Domitian was &amp;ldquo;Lord of all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roman citizens who refused or were believed to be insincere were &amp;ldquo;mercifully&amp;rdquo; beheaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-citizens suffered a worse fate, up to and including crucifixion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He offered compassion to the wealthy: they could have their lives spared but would be exiled to an Island in the Mediterranean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;domitian-john-and-patmos16&#34;&gt;Domitian, John, and Patmos&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In many ways, it is not surprising that Domitian and John crossed paths since John was the last of the original &lt;em&gt;Talmidim&lt;/em&gt; of Yeshua.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian ordered the arrest and extradition of John back to Rome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are several traditions associated with John&amp;rsquo;s arrest and trial before Domitian.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When it was time to execute John, Domitian first made him drink a cup of poison, but true to Jesus&amp;rsquo;s words (Mark 16:18), the poison did not harm him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, the ancient historian Tertullian records the deaths of Peter and Paul and the attempted death of John in Rome: &amp;ldquo;John was plunged unhurt into burning oil.&amp;rdquo; Another legend was that he was shaved from head to toe first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To bring us up to the time of Revelation, &amp;ldquo;When even the cauldron did not deter John from preaching Christ, by order of Domitian, he was relegated to the Island of Patmos.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because John wouldn&amp;rsquo;t die, Domitian exercised his last legal option to exile John to Patmos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At Patmos, John received the famous Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This fulfilled Jesus&#39; prophecy that &amp;ldquo;some of you here will not taste death until you see the Son of Man coming in Glory.&amp;rdquo; (Matthew 16:21)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, we can see that the world intended martyrdom for John, fulfilling Jesus&#39; prediction that James and John would indeed drink Jesus&#39; Cup of Suffering. (Matthew 20:23)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a post-script, the next emperor, Nerva, is recorded as being &amp;ldquo;wise and moderate.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Nerva released all the political prisoners, and John returned to Ephesus for the remainder of his days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion-relevance-to-revelation&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Relevance to Revelation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this background, keep the following in mind as we work through Revelation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose one wanted to indirectly refer to Rome (the people who destroyed the 2nd Temple).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In that case, he/she might compare them to the people who destroyed the 1st Temple: &lt;strong&gt;Babylon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose one wanted to refer to Domitian indirectly.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In that case, he/she might compare to an emperor who had a similar style: &lt;strong&gt;Nero&lt;/strong&gt; (whose name has a mathematical equivalent of &amp;ldquo;666&amp;rdquo; – we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss when we get to Revelation 13).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose one wanted to indirectly refer to a false messiah who demanded to be worshipped as &amp;ldquo;my master, my lord, my god.&amp;rdquo; In other words, this person required people to use titles rightly reserved for Jesus.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In that case, he/she might use the term &lt;strong&gt;Antichrist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose one wanted to indirectly refer to non-believing Jewish informants, who accused believing gentiles of &amp;ldquo;saying they were Jews when they were not.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In that case, we might say they were from the &amp;ldquo;synagogue of the accuser,&amp;rdquo; or since the Hebrew word for &amp;ldquo;accuser&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;satan,&amp;rdquo; we could say they are from the &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;synagogue of Satan&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;Satan&lt;/em&gt; is Hebrew for &amp;ldquo;accuser&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This does not mean that they were worshipping Satan the way we might think of it with satanic rituals and such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could say that they were doing Satan&amp;rsquo;s bidding.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we accuse another believer, either directly or through gossip, guess what?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are acting as an &amp;ldquo;accuser of the brethren.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further, one who claimed to be Jewish but informed against his neighbor is not upholding the high ethical standards of Judaism. He is a hypocrite. He is saying he is a Jew but is not acting like one. Thus we can apply the phrase &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;those who say they are Jews but are not.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please note this is spoken ONLY against those Jews who failed to uphold the high ethical standards expected of Jews by denouncing their neighbors to the authorities. This is not an indictment against all Jews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus, as a Jew, obviously would not label Himself as one &amp;ldquo;who said He was a Jew but was not.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If one were going to praise believers who stood up to the authorities, we might say they &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Held fast to His Name&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When John was arrested and taken to Rome, he had little hope for survival.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To a Jewish mind, John was &amp;ldquo;dead&amp;rdquo; as soon as the order for extradition came. See Hebrews 11:19.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Revelation 11, when John writes of two witnesses martyred for their testimony but who God raises from the dead, John&amp;rsquo;s audience could have thought, &amp;ldquo;oh, just like He raised John from the dead.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get the idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So much of Revelation is unlocked when we understand the context. We will open more as we progress through the study.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the primary reason why traditional Jews today can’t accept Jesus as their messiah. The deplorable treatment of Jews by the Church over the centuries has cemented this position in their minds.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall the “no friend of Caesar” exchange in John 19:12.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are differing views on this. Lancaster suggests that non-Jewish believers were not liable to pay the tax. When Domitian learned of this, enforcement became the cover story for Domitian&amp;rsquo;s intense persecutions of Christians. However, the Wikipedia article, &amp;ldquo;Fiscus Judaecus,&amp;rdquo; references scholars who suggest that since neither the Romans nor the Christians themselves viewed Christianity as a separate religion, non-Jewish believers in the first century were equally subject to the tax. I&amp;rsquo;m sympathetic to both views. Perhaps it was not as big of an issue under Vespasian as it was under Domitian, which is Lancaster&amp;rsquo;s frame of reference.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Hebrews 11:19, in Abraham&amp;rsquo;s mind, Isaac was &amp;ldquo;dead&amp;rdquo; as soon as God gave the command to sacrifice. The journey from Beersheva to Jerusalem took three days. Therefore, figuratively and typologically, Isaac rose from the dead on the third day.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This is the revelation which God gave to Yeshua the Messiah, so that he could show his servants what must happen very soon. He communicated it by sending his angel to his servant Yochanan, 2. who bore witness to the Word of God and to the testimony of Yeshua the Messiah, as much as he saw. 3. Blessed are the reader and hearers of the words of this prophecy, provided they obey the things written in it! For the time is near! 4. From: Yochanan To: The seven Messianic communities in the province of Asia: Grace and shalom to you from the One who is, who was and who is coming; from the sevenfold Spirit before his throne; 5. and from Yeshua the Messiah, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead and the ruler of the earth&amp;rsquo;s kings. To him, the one who loves us, who has freed us from our sins at the cost of his blood, 6. who has caused us to be a kingdom, that is, cohanim for God, his Father—to him be the glory and the rulership forever and ever. Amen. 7. Look! He is coming with the clouds! Every eye will see him, including those who pierced him; and all the tribes of the Land will mourn him. Yes! Amen! 8. &amp;ldquo;I am the &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;Z,&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; says Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, the One who is, who was and who is coming. 9. I, Yochanan, am a brother of yours and a fellow-sharer in the suffering, kingship and perseverance that come from being united with Yeshua. I had been exiled to the island called Patmos for having proclaimed the message of God and borne witness to Yeshua. 10. I came to be, in the Spirit, on the Day of the Lord; and I heard behind me a loud voice, like a trumpet, 11. saying, &amp;ldquo;Write down what you see on a scroll, and send it to the seven Messianic communities—Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;1:1 Daniel 2:28 but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream and the visions of your head as you lay in bed are these: 29 To you, O king, as you lay in bed came thoughts of what would be after this, and he who reveals mysteries made known to you what is to be.&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Allusions and Cross-References&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
We believe your study of this amazing book will be greatly enhanced if you read and meditate on the allusions listed. A comprehensive listing for all 22 chapters, including cross-references from the Treasury of Scripture Knowledge, is in Appendix A1.
&lt;p&gt;As you hover over (or tap) on each verse, the text of the English Standard Version will appear.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;this-is-the-revelation&#34;&gt;This is the Revelation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have several questions answered immediately in verse 1.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who wrote: John&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is it for: servants of Yeshua (not for unbelievers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is it about: Yeshua&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When should we study: immediately for the time is near&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we noted in the introduction, this is &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; revelation, so the book&amp;rsquo;s name is Revelation, not &amp;ldquo;revelations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John&amp;rsquo;s Hebrew name, Yochanan, means something like &amp;ldquo;blessed by God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although the original record we have is in Greek and John was multilingual, Jesus very likely communicated this in Hebrew, John&amp;rsquo;s primary language.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, Hebrew words for &amp;ldquo;revelation&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;exile&amp;rdquo; are linguistically related.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;גָלָה is the verb for &amp;ldquo;to reveal, uncover&amp;rdquo; and is pronounced &amp;ldquo;ga-LAH&amp;rdquo;; גָלוּת, &amp;ldquo;ga-LOOT,&amp;rdquo; is the word for exile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewish apocryphal writings, of which Revelation is included, tend to occur when the people were exiled by God, living outside the land when they were vulnerable to abuses by the pagan nations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we mentioned in the introduction, one of the purposes of Jewish apocalyptic literature was for God to communicate to His people that He is still in control. Although things seem unfair now, a day is coming when God will set everything straight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To help capture the &amp;ldquo;Jewishness&amp;rdquo; of the book, we will be using the Complete Jewish Bible (CJB) paraphrase translation.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No translation is perfect, and the CJB is not without problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can hover over any Bible reference and compare the English Standard Version (ESV). Often the King James Version does the best job at capturing the meaning of the Greek.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;godyeshuaangelyochanan&#34;&gt;God/Yeshua/Angel/Yochanan&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that we receive Revelation, &amp;ldquo;4th hand.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God gave it to Jesus, who gave it to an angel/messenger, who gave it to John, who wrote it down and communicated to the servants of Messiah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John is not receiving all of this directly from Jesus but through an angel who bears witness to Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the end of the chapter, we will be practically unable to distinguish who is speaking, even though we know from verse 1 that it must be the angel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This concept is very similar to the &amp;ldquo;Angel of the LORD&amp;rdquo; that we see in the Old Testament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We often presume this angel is a pre-incarnate version of Jesus, but it may not be that simple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There appears to be an &amp;ldquo;Angel of the Messiah,&amp;rdquo; just like an &amp;ldquo;Angel of the LORD.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This angel has the full authority to speak to John, just as if it were Jesus Himself speaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lizorkin and Shir discuss the challenges of figuring out who is speaking in Revelation:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;As in any complex composition, such a rich polyphony of heavenly sound will demand careful and attentive listening to clearly distinguish between the voices and appreciate both their choir-like message and the voice of the individual performers.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chapter one reveals that John&amp;rsquo;s concept of the &amp;ldquo;Trinity&amp;rdquo; may not be fully in keeping with the traditional Protestant view
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protestants see the Trinity as three co-equal persons. Still, throughout Revelation and even in the Gospel of John, Jesus is subordinate to the Father.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In verse 1, we see that Jesus had to learn about Revelation from the Father.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the doctrine of the Trinity is undoubtedly biblical, we must remember it is a man-made concept – the word &amp;ldquo;trinity&amp;rdquo; never appears in the Bible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We would be wise to loosely hold any man-made ideas (including views on Eschatology) as we work through Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let the Spirit pour into us as we check everything out against Scripture!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;servants&#34;&gt;Servants&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Greek word for servants is &lt;em&gt;doulos&lt;/em&gt; which we can translate as &amp;ldquo;bondservants.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bondservant is one who freely and willingly attaches himself to the household of his master, &amp;ldquo;because he loves you and your household since he is well-off with you.&amp;rdquo; (Deut 15:16-17)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As talmidim of Jesus, we are called to be His bondservants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This book is for us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we go through the book, we will highlight some of the patterns of seven that may not be obvious. The callout box below lists the seven instances of &amp;ldquo;Messiah&amp;rdquo; in Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Seven Messiah verses in Revelation&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;ldquo;Messiah&amp;rdquo; (Christ) appears seven times, starting with 1:1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the revelation which God gave to Yeshua the &lt;strong&gt;Messiah&lt;/strong&gt;, so that he could show his servants what must happen very soon. He communicated it by sending his angel to his servant Yochanan (Rev 1:1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who bore witness to the Word of God and to the testimony of Yeshua the &lt;strong&gt;Messiah&lt;/strong&gt;, as much as he saw. (Rev 1:2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and from Yeshua the &lt;strong&gt;Messiah&lt;/strong&gt;, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the earth&amp;rsquo;s kings. To him, the one who loves us, who has freed us from our sins at the cost of his blood, (Rev 1:5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seventh angel sounded his shofar; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, &amp;ldquo;The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and his &lt;strong&gt;Messiah&lt;/strong&gt;, and he will rule forever and ever!&amp;rdquo; (Rev 11:15)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, &amp;ldquo;Now have come God&amp;rsquo;s victory, power and kingship, and the authority of his &lt;strong&gt;Messiah&lt;/strong&gt;; because the Accuser of our brothers, who accuses them day and night before God, has been thrown out! (Rev 12:10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I saw thrones, and those seated on them received authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for testifying about Yeshua and proclaiming the Word of God, also those who had not worshipped the beast or its image and had not received the mark on their foreheads and on their hands. They came to life and ruled with the &lt;strong&gt;Messiah&lt;/strong&gt; for a thousand years. (Rev 20:4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blessed and holy is anyone who has a part in the first resurrection; over him the second death has no power. On the contrary, they will be cohanim of God and of the &lt;strong&gt;Messiah&lt;/strong&gt;, and they will rule with him for the thousand years. (Rev 20:6)
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-12-bore-witness&#34;&gt;Rev 1:2: Bore Witness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who &lt;mark&gt;bore witness&lt;/mark&gt; to the Word of God and to the &lt;mark&gt;testimony&lt;/mark&gt; of Yeshua the Messiah, as much as he saw.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;bore-witnesstestimony&#34;&gt;Bore witness/testimony&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John loves courtroom language (witness, testimony, testify, judge, judgment, authority (in the sense of legal standing), etc.). There are over 100 examples of this in John&amp;rsquo;s writings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John uses nearly the identical language in John 3:32-33 as he does in Revelation 1:2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Gospel, John portrayed evidence that Jesus was the proper authority. At the same time, the Jerusalem religious establishment were the usurpers, &amp;ldquo;bad shepherds,&amp;rdquo; an illegitimate regime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Revelation, he&amp;rsquo;s going to magnify that. The entire corrupt world system, not just the corrupt Jerusalem establishment, will be put on trial by God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, remember the context: believers in Asia were being betrayed to Roman courts. God grants true justice and righteous judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Seven Testimony verses&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
There are seven &#34;**Testimony**&#34; verses starting with 1:2. We can look at this list in a couple of ways.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are seven verses with &amp;ldquo;testimony&amp;rdquo; appearing twice in 19:10.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seven &amp;ldquo;Testimony of Jesus&amp;rdquo; references
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can remove 11:7 where &amp;ldquo;testimony &lt;strong&gt;of Jesus&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; is not directly implied – the two witnesses are testifying of God&amp;rsquo;s judgment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12:11 is directly implied as being martyred for their testimony of Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We count 19:10 twice for a total of seven&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who bore witness to the word of God and to the &lt;strong&gt;testimony of Jesus&lt;/strong&gt; Christ, even to all that he saw. (Rev 1:2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I, John, your brother and partner in the tribulation and the kingdom and the patient endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos on account of the word of God and the &lt;strong&gt;testimony of Jesus.&lt;/strong&gt; (Rev 1:9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;And when they have finished their&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;testimony&lt;/strong&gt;*, the beast that rises from the bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer them and kill them, (Rev 11:7)*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their &lt;strong&gt;testimony (of Jesus)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; for they loved not their lives even unto death. (Rev 12:11)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then the dragon became furious with the woman and went off to make war on the rest of her offspring, on those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the &lt;strong&gt;testimony of Jesus&lt;/strong&gt;. And he stood on the sand of the sea. (Rev 12:17)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, &amp;ldquo;You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold to the &lt;strong&gt;testimony of Jesus&lt;/strong&gt;. Worship God.&amp;rdquo; For the &lt;strong&gt;testimony of Jesus&lt;/strong&gt; is the Spirit of prophecy. (Rev 19:10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the &lt;strong&gt;testimony of Jesus&lt;/strong&gt; and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. (Rev 20:4)
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-13-the-blessing&#34;&gt;Rev 1:3: The Blessing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessed are the reader and hearers of the words of this prophecy, provided they obey the things written in it! For the time is near!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-blessing&#34;&gt;The blessing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the first of seven such blessings in the book (see callout below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation is the only book with such an explicit promise.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s no wonder the enemy tries to tell us it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to understand, and many have a spirit of fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversely, when believers wonder how they can be blessed by God, a biblical answer is &amp;ldquo;study Revelation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We aren&amp;rsquo;t told what form the blessing will be, but ANY gift from God will be great.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One such blessing may be that approaching Revelation as a Jewish book means you will read nearly 1000 verses from the Old Testament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another blessing is that we will walk away with a much more complete picture of our Savior&amp;rsquo;s person, mission, and destiny than we may have had previously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Greek carries the sense of read-aloud. Most people did not have their own copies of the Bible, so they would have had to hear it read aloud by the reader in the synagogue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that the blessing is conditional upon the reader understanding and obeying
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is very Hebraic. In Hebrew, verbs are action-oriented.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In English, we can listen, but we don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily equate hearing with obedience. In other words, we can listen passively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no such thought in Hebrew. If you don&amp;rsquo;t obey, you aren&amp;rsquo;t listening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stern writes, &amp;ldquo;in Judaism, learning is supposed to lead to doing.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the 18th century, a Christian Hebraist named Franz Delitzsch translated the New Testament from Greek back into Biblical Hebrew, using forms and idioms the Old Testament uses. It is a highly educated guess on what the original Jewish authors might have said had their works recorded in their original Hebrew.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Revelation 1:3, he used a verb that frequently appears in the Torah of Moses – hear/obey (Shema) – שָׁמַע. This beautiful Hebrew word is rich with meaning and application. Talmidim hear and obey the words of Yeshua. Most notably, the word appears in Deut 6:4, which is the famous &amp;ldquo;Shema Israel&amp;rdquo; passage, which Jesus quotes in Mark 12:29.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;שְׁמַ֖ע&lt;/em&gt; יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵ֖ינוּ יְהוָ֥ה ׀ אֶחָֽד׃&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then Deuteronomy verse 5 continues, &amp;ldquo;You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;hear&amp;rdquo; is followed by a list of behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in a Name?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also contained within the word שָׁמַע are the letters שׁ and מ. When we put those together, we get שֶׁם (shem), which is the Hebrew word for name (Hebrew has five letters that are spelled differently when at the end of a word. The mem (מ/ם) is one of those).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your name is not just a string of letters. In Hebraic thought, your name is your reputation and your character. Being an obedient listener and one who diligently keeps/guards God&amp;rsquo;s word reflects on our reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, when we take on the name of Yeshua, we must positively reflect His character. We do that by keeping and guarding His words. In a sense this could be the third commandment. When we fail to keep and guard his name, we could be said to be taking on his name in vain. Conversely, there is a blessing to be had when we keep obey and guard His reputation.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;very-soon-and-for-the-time-is-near&#34;&gt;Very soon and for the time is near!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John believed the fulfillment of all things was very near.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He did not mean merely within a few years and certainly did not mean two thousand years! He is writing with a sense of urgency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fact, we can defend from Scripture that the New Testament authors didn&amp;rsquo;t just believe the &amp;ldquo;end times&amp;rdquo; were near; they thought the end times were upon them.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See 1 Corinthians 10:11 and note that Paul directly connects the Old Testament with the &amp;ldquo;end times.&amp;rdquo; Further, the &amp;ldquo;end times&amp;rdquo; IS the fulfillment of Old Testament Prophecies.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The above point is critically important to keep in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul and John weren&amp;rsquo;t looking to events occurring in the world around them; they were looking to the &amp;ldquo;fulfillment of the purposes and prophecies of the Old Testament.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An alternate sense could be once the events commence, they will unfold rapidly;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 Peter 3:3-4 seems to imply Peter at least suspected there would be some delay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet, at the end of the passage (2 Peter 3:10), Peter says every believer should be alert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Seven Blessings&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are seven &lt;em&gt;berachot&lt;/em&gt; (blessings) starting with 1:3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed&lt;/strong&gt; are the reader and hearers of the words of this prophecy, provided they obey the things written in it! For the time is near! (Rev 1:3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed&lt;/strong&gt; are the dead who die in the Lord (Rev 14:13).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed&lt;/strong&gt; is he that watches and keeps his garments (Rev 16:15).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed&lt;/strong&gt; are they who are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb (Rev 19:9).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed&lt;/strong&gt; and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection (Rev 20:6).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed&lt;/strong&gt; is he that keeps the words of the prophecy of this book (Rev 22:7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed&lt;/strong&gt; are they that wash their robes (Rev 22:14).
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-14-grace-and-shalom&#34;&gt;Rev 1:4: Grace and Shalom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Revelation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;OT Allusions&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4. From: Yochanan To: The seven Messianic communities in the province of Asia:  Grace and shalom to you from the One who is, who was and who is coming; from the sevenfold Spirit before his throne;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1:4 Isa 11: 2 And the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;from-yochananjohn&#34;&gt;From Yochanan/John&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While we can&amp;rsquo;t be 100% certain, most conservative scholars believe this is John the Apostle (see the introductory lesson for more background)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whichever John this was, we might say &amp;ldquo;he needed no introduction.&amp;rdquo; We are given no further background than &amp;ldquo;John,&amp;rdquo; indicating that he was well-known to his audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several early church writers believed the letter was a forgery and argued that the book should not become part of the New Testament canon.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They based this view partly because the Greek of Revelation is borderline substandard quality, particularly compared to the Gospel of John.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This may be explained. The Gospel was composed with a translator, someone learned in Greek, which John was not. On Patmos, John was left with his limited Greek skills.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;seven-communitieschurches&#34;&gt;Seven communities/&amp;ldquo;churches&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/49f033022fe7e954bd6946926032fbc0.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immediately there is underlying tension we might miss.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are in Asia. Modern Turkey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jews aren&amp;rsquo;t supposed to be outside Eretz Israel (the land of Israel)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a big clue that things are out of order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the end of the book, they will be back in the Land&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We talked about this anachronism of the word &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; during the introduction.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The church, either an institution or a gathering of people, did not exist when John wrote.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is hard not to call them &amp;ldquo;the seven churches.&amp;rdquo; If we do, we need to be aware of the anachronism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number &amp;ldquo;seven&amp;rdquo; is a fingerprint of the Holy Spirit and speaks of completeness and fulfillment. It can also carry a sense of holiness/set apartness-the Shabbat (7th day) is a time to be set apart from the other six days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whatever other interpretations of Revelation may be plausible, we must remember first and foremost it was written to actual first-century congregations with real struggles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we look at a map&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, the seven cities are in relative proximity. We can easily imagine the letter starting in Ephesus and traveling clockwise to Smyrna, using the Roman road system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, there were many more than seven congregations in Asia (one received a letter from Paul, Colossians).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t exactly know why these seven were called out
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indeed, these seven had real problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problems are likely typical of what other fellowships were going through at the time.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each letter will end with &amp;ldquo;hear what the Spirit says to the church&lt;em&gt;es&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; (i.e., the words are directed to all fellowships, not just the specific one addressed).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster speculates that many fellowships likely existed in each town. In other words, there was probably not merely one assembly in Ephesus.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He says that although it is unlikely there were separate fellowships for Gentiles (as the Jew/Gentile split in Christianity had not yet occurred, or at best was only in its infancy), there may have been separate meetings for Believers in Messiah that were distinct from other Jewish fellowships.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This could explain why some believers had been arrested and martyred, but others in the same town had not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;grace-and-shalom-peace&#34;&gt;Grace and Shalom (Peace)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This could be a combination of the Greek &lt;em&gt;Charis&lt;/em&gt; (grace) and the Hebrew &lt;em&gt;shalom&lt;/em&gt; (peace)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr Bolen writes: &amp;ldquo;the greeting seems to combine a common formulaic openings in Greco-Roman and Semitic letters.&amp;rdquo; Grace&amp;rdquo; (Gk. charis, χάρις) is related to the common Greek word &amp;ldquo;greetings&amp;rdquo; (Gk. chairein, χαίρειν) as seen in Acts 15:23, 23:26, and James 1:1 (cf. Matt 26:49, Mark 15:18, Luke 1:28, and John 19:3). &amp;ldquo;Peace&amp;rdquo; (Gk. eirēnē, εἰρήνη; Heb. shalōm, שָׁלוֹם) is a common Semitic greeting as seen in Luke 10:5, 24:36, and John 20:19.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potentially, both meanings are encompassed by the rich Hebrew word &lt;em&gt;shalom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dan Stolebarger says that when we wish someone &amp;ldquo;shalom,&amp;rdquo; we are wishing them &amp;ldquo;peace as it was before the Fall.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;True Shalom comes when God makes everything right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-trinity&#34;&gt;The Trinity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verses 4-5 are widely and correctly viewed as &lt;strong&gt;the Trinity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this case, the order is Father, Spirit, Son, which is consistent with John&amp;rsquo;s overall view that Jesus is (somehow) subordinate to the Father. It is the Spirit who empowers the Son.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Father – John uses an identical phrase as the Septuagint translation of Exodus 3:14.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Hebrew, this is unmistakable. “I am who I am” אֶֽהְיֶ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶֽהְיֶ֑ה (ehyeh asher eheyh).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general terms, God is transcendent. Missler says, &amp;ldquo;Time is a physical property subject to mass acceleration and gravity. God&amp;rsquo;s not subject to those. God is not someone with lots of time. He&amp;rsquo;s outside our time domain altogether. He knows the end from the beginning.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that the &amp;ldquo;Father&amp;rdquo; is also described as One who…&amp;rdquo; is coming&amp;rdquo; – we usually think of Jesus, the Son, as the One who is coming again. Still, in some sense, the Father is also coming.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Zechariah 14:4, Adonai will set His foot upon the Mount of Olives. The text doesn&amp;rsquo;t say, &amp;ldquo;Messiah will set foot upon the Mount of Olives.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In some places in Scripture, we see some distinction among the roles.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus sits at the right hand of the Father (Acts 2:33)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus doesn&amp;rsquo;t pray to Himself or the Spirit, but to the Father, and says His job is to glorify the Father. (John 17:1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In others, we see a blurring of roles.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both Adonai, whom we usually view as &amp;ldquo;The Father,&amp;rdquo; and Jesus say, &amp;ldquo;I am the first and the last.&amp;rdquo; (Father in Rev 1:8, Son in Rev 1:17).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul says the Spirit caused Jesus to rise from the Dead (Rom 8:11), and he also says it was the Father (Gal 1:1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In several locations, Jesus says He is the &amp;ldquo;I AM&amp;rdquo; of our Old Testament.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lizorkin and Shir phrase it like this: &amp;ldquo;The Son and the Father are distinct, but somehow so connected that they cannot always be distinguished.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the better comparisons I&amp;rsquo;ve heard to describe the Trinity is as three partners in a corporation. Each partner may act independently, but legally the corporation is one unit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All models are clumsy because we are trying to describe the infiniteness of God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bottom line is the more we can remain flexible in our concepts of the Trinity, the less befuddling Revelation will be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sevenfold-spirit&#34;&gt;Sevenfold Spirit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This could also be rendered &amp;ldquo;seven spirits.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number seven represents completeness. Therefore &amp;ldquo;sevenfold Spirit&amp;rdquo; is likely simply describing the Spirit as the complete and perfect Spirit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewish tradition sees seven archangels.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster and Lizorkin/Shir dive into this in their commentaries and believe this is potentially in John&amp;rsquo;s view, given his Jewish background. They connect this verse with the seven angels that repeatedly appear in the book.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster notes the parallel in the description of the person giving the revelation between Revelation 1:9-18 and Daniel 10.  In Daniel 10, the messenger is clearly a supernatural angel, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a member of the Trinity.  We will discuss this further in the next lesson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lizorkin and Shir are also skeptical of the connection to Isaiah 11:2, which is often cited as a parallel passage. &amp;ldquo;This does not explain why there are seven spirits mentioned in Revelation.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They caution that we may be force-reading our view of the trinity into this passage when that may not be what John intended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Seven angels&amp;rdquo; appear repeatedly in Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;td&gt;5. and from Yeshua the Messiah, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead and the ruler of the earth&amp;rsquo;s kings. To him, the one who loves us, who has freed us from our sins at the cost of his blood,  6. who has caused us to be a kingdom, that is, Cohanim for God, his Father—to him be the glory and the rulership forever and ever. Amen.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1:5 Gen 49: 11 Binding his foal to the vine and his donkey&amp;rsquo;s colt to the choice vine, he has washed his garments in wine and his vesture in the blood of grapes. Psa 89:27 And I will make him the firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.   1:6 Ex 19:5-6 Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; 6 and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&#39; These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel.&amp;rdquo; Isa 61:6 but you shall be called the priests of the LORD; they shall speak of you as the ministers of our God; you shall eat the wealth of the nations, and in their glory you shall boast.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;firstborn-of-the-dead&#34;&gt;Firstborn of the dead&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not to say that Jesus was the first ever to be raised from the dead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Judaism, &amp;ldquo;firstborn&amp;rdquo; is a title of inheritance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The firstborn would receive a double-portion.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While usually, this was the eldest son, the eldest son could forfeit the title of firstborn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joseph was the 11th of Jacob&amp;rsquo;s 12 sons, yet was the titular Firstborn who received a double portion of Jacob&amp;rsquo;s inheritance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Jewish feast of firstfruits is also in view (always on Sunday after Passover).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This title is synonymous with victory .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because Jesus conquered death, we can (and will!) too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ruler-of-the-earths-kingsone-who-loves-usfreed-uscaused-us-to-be-cohanim-priests&#34;&gt;Ruler of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s Kings/One who loves us/Freed us/Caused us to be Cohanim (priests)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1 Corinthians 15 (the &amp;ldquo;resurrection chapter&amp;rdquo;), Paul connects the dots – since Jesus is the firstborn of the dead, He will come again and &amp;ldquo;hand over the Kingdom to God the Father, after having put an end to every rulership, yes, to every authority and power.&amp;rdquo; (1Co 15:24)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To an audience fearful of persecution, these words remind them who is truly in charge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversely, the challenge for us is whether we have indeed submitted to his kingship, or are we still telling Him, &amp;ldquo;I got this&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we submit to Him, it&amp;rsquo;s good to know that He loves us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation tells the outcome for those who tell God, &amp;ldquo;I got this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exodus 19:5-6: Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&#39; These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of this has to do with how we spend our time in this life.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Seven components to the description of Messiah&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is the faithful witness (or &amp;ldquo;the faithful martyr&amp;rdquo;; see Rev_2:13).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is the firstborn (or &amp;ldquo;foremost, chief&amp;rdquo;) of those who get raised from the dead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is the ruler of the earth&amp;rsquo;s kings, the &amp;ldquo;King of Kings&amp;rdquo; (Rev_17:14, Rev_19:16) who will one day subject to himself even the most unbridled and oppressive governments (1Co_15:24-25).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He loves us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He causes us to be freed from our sins at the cost of his blood (that is, by his bloody, sacrificial death; see Rom_3:24).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He causes us to be a kingdom, a community subject to him who loves us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He causes us to be cohanim (&amp;ldquo;priests&amp;rdquo;) for God, his Father.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern notes that the first three attributes would have brought immediate comfort to the faithful. Because He loves us, we gain the final three &amp;ldquo;benefits&amp;rdquo; as we might call them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Sevens: &amp;lsquo;Amen!&amp;rsquo;&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen is a Hebrew word that connotes &amp;ldquo;truth&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;may it be so.&amp;rdquo; Every time you say &amp;ldquo;amen,&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;re speaking Hebrew! Yay you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who has caused us to be a kingdom, that is, cohanim for God, his Father—to him be the glory and the rulership forever and ever. &lt;strong&gt;Amen&lt;/strong&gt;. (Rev 1:6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look! He is coming with the clouds! Every eye will see him, including those who pierced him; and all the tribes of the Land will mourn him. Yes! &lt;strong&gt;Amen&lt;/strong&gt;! (Rev 1:7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Laodicea, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the &lt;strong&gt;Amen&lt;/strong&gt;, the faithful and true witness, the Ruler of God&amp;rsquo;s creation: (Rev 3:14)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The four living beings said, &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Amen&lt;/strong&gt;!&amp;rdquo; and the elders fell down and worshipped. (Rev 5:14)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Amen! &amp;ldquo;Praise and glory, wisdom and thanks, honor and power and strength belong to our God forever and ever! &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Amen&lt;/strong&gt;!&amp;rdquo; (Rev 7:12)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The twenty-four elders and the four living beings fell down and worshipped God, sitting on the throne, and said, &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Amen&lt;/strong&gt;! Halleluyah!&amp;rdquo; (Rev 19:4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The one who is testifying to these things says, &amp;lsquo;Yes, I am coming soon!&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;Amen&lt;/strong&gt;! Come, Lord Yeshua! (Rev 22:20)

&lt;td&gt;7. Look! He is coming with the clouds! Every eye will see him, including those who pierced him; and all the tribes of the Land will mourn him. Yes! Amen!  8. &amp;ldquo;I am the &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;Z,&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; says Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, the One who is, who was and who is coming.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1:7 Dan 7:13-14 &amp;ldquo;I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. &lt;br&gt;Zech 12:10-14 &amp;ldquo;And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and pleas for mercy, so that, when they look on me, on him whom they have pierced, they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only child, and weep bitterly over him, as one weeps over a firstborn. 11 On that day the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning for Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo. 12 The land shall mourn, each family by itself: the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves; 13 the family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself, and their wives by themselves; 14 and all the families that are left, each by itself, and their wives by themselves. &lt;br&gt; 1:8 Isa 41:4 Who has performed and done this, calling the generations from the beginning? I, the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;look-behold-he-comes&#34;&gt;Look! Behold He comes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hebrew word for &amp;ldquo;behold&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;hinei&amp;rdquo; and it frequently appears in the Old Testament
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may have learned that the word &amp;ldquo;therefore&amp;rdquo; is a clue, particularly in Paul&amp;rsquo;s writings. The saying goes, &amp;ldquo;whenever you see a &amp;lsquo;therefore,&amp;rsquo; you always want to ask, &amp;lsquo;what is it there for?&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conceptually the same is true for &amp;ldquo;behold&amp;rdquo; in the Old Testament. The author is calling something to our attention in the narrative. We want to make sure we know what is we are beholding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Hineini!  הִנֵנִי&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely related to the word &amp;ldquo;hinei&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;heneini.&amp;rdquo; In Genesis 22, when God calls out,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Avraham! Avraham!&amp;rdquo; Abraham answers in Hebrew, &amp;ldquo;Hineini!&amp;rdquo; – translated as &amp;ldquo;here am I&amp;rdquo; but also the purpose of Behold, me! In the sense of &amp;ldquo;I am available, pick me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah also says &amp;ldquo;Hineini&amp;rdquo; in Isaiah 6:8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an expression that God values your &lt;em&gt;avail&lt;/em&gt;ability more than he values your ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a great Hebrew prayer, just tell God, &amp;ldquo;Hineini!&amp;rdquo; Look! I&amp;rsquo;m available!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;clouds&#34;&gt;Clouds&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare Acts 1:11 – He will return very similar to how He ascended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel 7 talks about the Messiah emerging from clouds and going before the Ancient of Days. There the Father gives the Son all things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A minor note that whoever is speaking switches to the 3rd person in verse seven, and then God will take over in Verse 8. Figuring out who is speaking is not nearly as important as the truth of the words spoken. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to notice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-tribes-will-mourn&#34;&gt;The tribes will mourn&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protestant/Pre-tribulation theology holds that once these events happen, there may be little, if any, hope for any unbeliever to repent, least of all traditional Jews who are cursed for rejecting their Messiah and forfeited all of their promises to the Church. This view stems from Replacement Theology. See the callout note below for additional information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zechariah 13:11 tells a different story. They will mourn him but that not the end of the story.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The people specifically from the House of David will be cleansed from their sins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore a &amp;ldquo;terminal&amp;rdquo; judgment may not be what John is communicating in verse 7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mourning may be that of a repentant heart; the same heart we should have when we ponder the price He truly paid for us. Through his sacrifice, all the families of the Earth shall be blessed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Replacement Theology&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a personal note, ever since my first trip to Israel in 2010, my eyes have been more open to the fact that we hold in our hands a single book, which in the hands of gentile church leaders all but stripped it of its Jewishness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, come to find our Messiah/Christ is Jewish. All the writers of the New Testament were Jewish. As best we can tell, Luke was a gentile convert to Judaism. The Bible, first and foremost, is about the redemption of Israel and the coming Messianic Kingdom; Revelation is the culmination of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roman 11 says the Gentiles have been grafted in and should not boast about our superiority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a nasty theory that goes by the name of Replacement Theology, which says that because Israel rejected and crucified her Messiah, all the promises meant for Israel in the Old Testament now have their spiritual fulfillment in the Church. Other components include the beliefs that Jesus and Paul forsook their Judaism and founded a gentile religion. It is said that Jesus was a sabbath breaker and Paul disregarded the dietary laws. All of these are provable as false if we do Acts 17:11 research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with this general theory is it makes God an untrustworthy liar, the Old Testament irrelevant, the law as opposite of grace, and causes us to see Jews as enemies. Replacement Theology is a tare that the enemy has planted, which has grown up alongside the nutritious kernels of solid doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must guard against Replacement Theology as this violates the two great commandments. If we view God as able to break His promises, how can we say we &amp;ldquo;love the Lord our God with our whole hearts, minds, and strengths?&amp;rdquo; If we ascribe the evil deeds of what may have been less than 20 corrupt religious leaders and blame an entire race of people, how can we say we &amp;ldquo;love our neighbors as ourselves?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Replacement Theology is a lie that has been repeated so often for the last 1500 years that it seeps into otherwise educated and insightful men writing contemporary commentaries. I may agree with 90% of everything else a given commentator says but if there is even a hint of Replacement Theology, I&amp;rsquo;m going to do my best to call it out and correct the errant conclusion.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;8. &amp;ldquo;I am the &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;Z,&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; says Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, the One who is, who was and who is coming.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1:8 Isa 41:4 Who has performed and done this, calling the generations from the beginning? I, the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;alpha-and-omegaa-and-zaleph-and-tav&#34;&gt;Alpha and Omega/A and Z/Aleph and Tav&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We typically think of Jesus as saying He is the Alpha and the Omega, but note here, we would say it is &amp;ldquo;God the Father&amp;rdquo; speaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phrase also appears in Rev 21:6 and Rev 22:13.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Hebrew, the first and last letters are Aleph א and Tav ת.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The word אֵת (et) has a unique function in Hebrew. See the callout box if you are interested in learning more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note again that the Father says He &amp;ldquo;is coming.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another one of God&amp;rsquo;s names in the Hebrew Bible is El Shaddai - which is God almighty in the sense of the protector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;The Aleph and the Tav&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word אֵת is most often used as a grammatical marker in the Bible. It is used to indicate a definite direct object. When used this way, it has no direct translational value. It is spelled with Aleph (א) and tav (ת).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional Jewish exegesis (a fancy word for &amp;ldquo;Bible study&amp;rdquo;) sees four layers of meaning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The literal surface meaning – we always start here, and the deeper interpretations must never contradict the base meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is called a &amp;ldquo;hint of something deeper.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A comparative meaning often drawn from the conclusion of similar words/phrases among passages.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 19:18 contain the exact phrase, &amp;ldquo;and you shall love.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus was employing this level of interpretation when He linked these two verses as &amp;ldquo;the greatest commandment&amp;rdquo; – &amp;ldquo;and you shall love the Lord your God…&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;and you shall love your neighbor…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An esoteric mystical meaning (obviously, we use this one with caution).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a &amp;ldquo;hint of something deeper,&amp;rdquo; several verses in Hebrew can take on an added deeper meaning when we consider that Jesus called Himself the &amp;ldquo;Aleph and the Tav.&amp;rdquo; Let&amp;rsquo;s look at just three of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genesis 1:1 – the very first verse in the Bible:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים &lt;strong&gt;אֵת&lt;/strong&gt; הַשָּׁמַיִם &lt;strong&gt;וְאֵת&lt;/strong&gt; הָאָרֶץ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curiously there are also precisely seven Hebrew words. In the beginning (all one word) created God (et) the heaven (et) the earth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could we also say that in the beginning, God, &lt;strong&gt;the Aleph, and Tav&lt;/strong&gt;, created the heavens, and &lt;strong&gt;the Aleph and Tav&lt;/strong&gt; created the world? I believe we could.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genesis 1:4
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;וַיַּ֧רְא אֱלֹהִ֛ים &lt;strong&gt;אֶת&lt;/strong&gt;־הָא֖וֹר כִּי־ט֑וֹב&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And God saw the light, and it was good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And God saw &lt;strong&gt;the Aleph and Tav&lt;/strong&gt;, the Light, and it was good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zechariah 12:10
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;והביטו אלי &lt;strong&gt;את&lt;/strong&gt; אשׁר־דקרו&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They will look upon me whom they have pierced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They will look upon me, &lt;strong&gt;the Aleph and Tav,&lt;/strong&gt; whom they have pierced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Seven &amp;lsquo;LORD, God Almighty&amp;rsquo;&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the literal phrase used in the Old Testament (אֱלֹהֵֽי־צְבָא֖וֹת which sometimes gets translated as &amp;ldquo;God of Hosts&amp;rdquo;, and commonly, but &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; poorly transliterated as &amp;ldquo;Jehovah Sabaoth&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am the &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;Z,&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; says Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, the One who is, who was and who is coming. (Rev 1:8)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each of the four living beings had six wings and was covered with eyes inside and out; and day and night they never stop saying, &amp;ldquo;Holy, holy, holy is Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies the One who was, who is and who is coming!&amp;rdquo; (Rev 4:8)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;saying, &amp;ldquo;We thank you, Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, the One who is and was, that you have taken your power and have begun to rule. (Rev 11:17)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They were singing the song of Moshe, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb: &amp;ldquo;Great and wonderful are the things you have done, Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies! Just and true are your ways, king of the nations! (Rev 15:3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I heard the altar say, &amp;ldquo;Yes, Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, your judgments are true and just!&amp;rdquo; (Rev 16:7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I heard what sounded like the roar of a huge crowd, like the sound of rushing waters, like loud peals of thunder, saying, &amp;ldquo;Halleluyah! Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, has begun his reign! (Rev 19:6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I saw no Temple in the city, for Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, is its Temple, as is the Lamb. (Rev 21:22)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why &amp;ldquo;Adonai&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many of our English Bibles, when translators came across what is called the &amp;ldquo;Tetragrammaton&amp;rdquo; (The Hebrew word for God&amp;rsquo;s name spelled yod-hei-vav-hei), they typically render it as &lt;small&gt;LORD&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, they are preserving a Jewish custom that was in place during the time of Jesus&#39; ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observant Jews will never attempt to pronounce this name. Instead, they will say &amp;ldquo;Adonai&amp;rdquo; if in a formal/religious setting or &amp;ldquo;Hashem,&amp;rdquo; Hebrew for &amp;ldquo;The Name,&amp;rdquo; if in a less formal setting. This purposeful avoidance of using God&amp;rsquo;s sacred Name is called a &amp;ldquo;circumlocution.&amp;rdquo; Jesus used circumlocutions many times and NEVER pronounced the Name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage our students to use a circumlocution such as &amp;ldquo;Lord&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Adonai.&amp;rdquo;. It shows similar honor as not calling your parents by their first name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, &amp;ldquo;Jehovah&amp;rdquo; is a made-up word. Some Hebrew Bibles add the vowels from &amp;ldquo;Adonai&amp;rdquo; to the Tetragrammaton. This is to remind readers to say &amp;ldquo;Adonai.&amp;rdquo; When some non-Hebrew speaker mistakenly tried to pronounce this non-word, he came up with &amp;ldquo;Jehovah.&amp;rdquo; Don&amp;rsquo;t call God &amp;ldquo;Jehovah.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s not a real word!
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever been to a Jewish home, you may have noticed something long and narrow attached to an outer door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/e5d1e7831cd11a6b9ef323c77f8d1a18.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;33%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is called a Mezuzah and it comes from a command in Deu 6:9 You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Referring to the Shema, you shall love the Lord with all your heart, all your soul and all your might.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inside the Mezuzah will be a scroll with the Shema and other passages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the outside of the Mezuzah will be the Hebrew letter Shin, the W looking character you can see on this mezuzah. The shin is short for Shaddai.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Mezuzah serves as a reminder that God almighty is the great protector and in return He asks for our love and obedience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll say this a lot but remember John&amp;rsquo;s original audience was under a death sentence for practicing their faith. They neeed to be reminded of God&amp;rsquo;s almighty-ness and His protection and provision. God&amp;rsquo;s army is WAAAAY more powerful than the Roman army.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I, Yochanan, am a brother of yours and a fellow-sharer in the suffering, kingship, and perseverance that come from being united with Yeshua. I had been exiled to the island called Patmos for having proclaimed the message of God and borne witness to Yeshua.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 10:2-4 In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three weeks. 3 I ate no delicacies, no meat or wine entered my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, for the full three weeks. 4 On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river (that is, the Tigris)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;exiled-to-patmos&#34;&gt;Exiled to Patmos&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/4ba61b20eea37afb7fb8d31162fcbb1a.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John is positioning himself as an equal, not a superior; an empathizer not a sympathizer.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We discussed how John came to be at Patmos during our background lesson.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patmos is a relatively small Greek island (17.5 sq mi) about 35 miles off the coast of Turkey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were two levels of Roman exile&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first was actual deportation (&lt;em&gt;deportatio in insulaim&lt;/em&gt;), in which the prisoner lost all rights; this was permanent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second was what we might call a relegation (&lt;em&gt;relegation ad insulam&lt;/em&gt;), which was a temporary banishment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It appears John fell into the second group. In any case, the Romans did not want the Gospel going out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surrounded by water, it is no surprise that the sea is a dominant image throughout the book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the fifth century, the &amp;ldquo;Cave of the Apocalypse&amp;rdquo; has been venerated to mark the site where John received visitation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Photo credit:&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;proclaimed-the-message-of-god&#34;&gt;Proclaimed the message of God&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This will be a recurring theme as many believers will be martyred for this reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We believe John wasn&amp;rsquo;t directly martyred but died of natural causes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, if we believe the tradition, Domitian ordered John boiled in oil, yet John was spared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Jewish mind would say that John &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; martyred, and then he was delivered by God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;daniel-10-as-parallel-passage&#34;&gt;Daniel 10 as parallel passage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a parallel of Revelation 1:9-20 and Daniel 10, which we will explore next lesson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For now, note the similarities of 1:9 to Daniel 10:2-4.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They both have a &amp;ldquo;double&amp;rdquo; introduction for emphasis (&amp;ldquo;I, John&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;I, Daniel&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both can be said to be physically suffering for God (John externally and Daniel internally through a three-week fast).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both are in exile (John at Patmos, Daniel on the bank of the Tigres in Babylon).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-110-in-the-spirit-on-the-day-of-the-lord&#34;&gt;Rev 1:10: In the Spirit on the Day of the Lord&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;I came to be, in the Spirit, on the Day of the Lord; and I heard behind me a loud voice, like a trumpet&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;i-came-to-be-in-the-spirit&#34;&gt;I came to be in the Spirit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three primary options, each of which is a conjecture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John&amp;rsquo;s received a vision but was not physically transported anywhere, like a dream (and it was not uncommon for people to receive messages from God via dreams)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John had what we might call an &amp;ldquo;out of body experience&amp;rdquo;; his body remained on Patmos, but he was otherwise transported to the heavenly throne&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John was physically present&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2 Corinthians 12:2, Paul says, &amp;ldquo;whether in the body or out of the body, I do not know.&amp;rdquo;  Maybe John himself didn&amp;rsquo;t know either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;day-of-the-lordlords-day&#34;&gt;Day of the Lord/Lord&amp;rsquo;s Day&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was this a weekday or a moment in time? The possibilities discussed below are conjecture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Sunday
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While this is the day we honor the resurrection, there is no biblical evidence that the first day of the week was ever referred to as &amp;ldquo;The Lord&amp;rsquo;s day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Saturday
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Genesis 2, Exodus 16, and Exodus 20, if there is one day of the week that God holds holy, it&amp;rsquo;s Saturday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a direct connection between the Sabbath and the kingdom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, the Bible never refers to Shabbat as &amp;ldquo;the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Day&amp;rdquo; either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This view is further rendered unlikely since John was told to write, a creative activity widely considered prohibited on Shabbat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John was not referencing a specific day of the week, but a particular moment in time: &lt;strong&gt;the fulfillment and restoration of all things.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are NUMEROUS biblical references for the &amp;ldquo;Day of the Lord&amp;rdquo; to support this view: (Is. 2:12; 13:6-9; Ezek. 13:5, 30:3; Joel 1:15; 2:1-31; 3:14; Amos 5:18-20; Obad. 15; Zeph 1:7-14; Zech 14:1; Mal 4:5).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is where I tend to land.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John wasn&amp;rsquo;t telling us the day of the week so much as he told us the moment in time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As Stern comments, for John to note the day of the week would be a minor if not an entirely insignificant detail. For John to say he was present for the final judgment is monumentally significant.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-loud-voice-like-a-trumpet&#34;&gt;A loud voice like a trumpet&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hebrew for loud voice &lt;em&gt;kol gadol –&lt;/em&gt; this is also how the Bible describes thunder or a deafening noise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Daniel 10:6, &amp;ldquo;the sound of his words were like the sound of a multitude.&amp;rdquo; (photo credit&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). John hears the same sound, but it is &amp;ldquo;loud voice, like a trumpet&amp;rdquo; to him.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Greek does not indicate whether the trumpet is a &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt; (a ram&amp;rsquo;s horn made into a trumpet) or a brass trumpet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A brass trumpet would connote a call to battle, while a shofar would connote a call to worship. Either may be applicable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later in chapter 1, John will more clearly describe a &lt;em&gt;menorah&lt;/em&gt;, so precisely, a &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt;, also used in the Jewish Temple service, looks likely here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In any case, when a Jew such as John heard a trumpet, he knew it was a call to assemble and prepare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John wrote the vision down right away not just to remember it but also so it would function as a testimony.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The person receiving an apocalypse was often told to &amp;ldquo;seal up&amp;rdquo; the words. Not so with John. This is to be an &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Seven First and Last?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The KJV adds, &amp;ldquo;I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last&amp;rdquo; before the instruction to write.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This phrase is not contained in the newer translations (NIV, ESV, NLT, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As familiar as the phrase &amp;ldquo;First and Last&amp;rdquo; is, it only occurs three times in Isaiah and then, according to KJV, four times in Revelation for a total of seven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this instance, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t surprise me if the KJV is correct and the other translations were mistaken in omitting &amp;ldquo;I am the first and the last&amp;rdquo; from verse 11.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Isaiah 41:4 Who has performed and done this, calling the generations from the beginning? I, the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah 44:6 Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: “I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah 48:12  “Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel, whom I called! I am he; I am the first, and I am the last.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revelation 1:11&lt;/em&gt; (disputed) Saying, &lt;em&gt;I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and,&lt;/em&gt; What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation 1:17 And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation 2:8 And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation 22:13  I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 12 will begin a very unusual description of Jesus (or perhaps a blurring of the entire Godhead). We will pick this up next time, but there is one crucial point to make. The picture of Jesus in our minds may be quite different from the Jesus of Revelation. We must be conformed to his image and not force God to conform to our image. As we have been saying, we need not cling too tightly to any preconceptions. Revelation may challenge a lot of them. Part of the blessing from reading Revelation comes with our own unveiling; that is, when our biases and bloodspots are exposed and resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One tell-tale sign of this in the Gospels is when people pick up stones to stone Jesus. We may miss what is going on, but in the people&amp;rsquo;s minds, Jesus had just committed blasphemy by equating Himself to God (or as Christians would say, &amp;ldquo;God the Father&amp;rdquo;). The penalty for blasphemy is death by stoning.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

His head and hair were as white as snow-white wool, his eyes like a fiery flame, 15. his feet like burnished brass refined in a furnace, and his voice like the sound of rushing waters. 16. In his right hand he held seven stars, out of his mouth went a sharp double-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in full strength. 17. When I saw him, I fell down at his feet like a dead man. He placed his right hand upon me and said, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid! I am the First and the Last, 18. the Living One. I was dead, but look!—I am alive forever and ever! And I hold the keys to Death and Sh&amp;rsquo;ol. 19. So write down what you see, both what is now, and what will happen afterward. 20. Here is the secret meaning of the seven stars you saw in my right hand, and of the seven gold menorahs: the seven stars are the angels of the seven Messianic communities, and the seven menorahs are the seven Messianic communities.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;daniel-7-and-10&#34;&gt;Daniel 7 and 10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called &amp;ldquo;Vision of the Risen Christ&amp;rdquo; in Revelation 1:12-18 has several similarities (and key differences) with Daniel 7 and Daniel 10. It is beneficial to read the Daniel passages before we begin a verse-by-verse study of the remainder of Revelation 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Daniel passages, focus on the depictions of the &amp;ldquo;Ancient of Days&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Son of Man&amp;rdquo; in Daniel 7:9-14, and then the description of the unnamed angel in Daniel 10:5-10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-2&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;(1) In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head as he lay in his bed. Then he wrote down the dream and told the sum of the matter. (2) Daniel declared, &amp;ldquo;I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea. (3) And four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another. (4) The first was like a lion and had eagles&#39; wings. Then as I looked its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and the mind of a man was given to it. (5) And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side. It had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, &amp;lsquo;Arise, devour much flesh.&amp;rsquo; (6) After this I looked, and behold, another, like a leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back. And the beast had four heads, and dominion was given to it. (7) After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns. (8) I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them &lt;mark&gt;another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(9) &amp;ldquo;As I looked, thrones were placed, and the &lt;mark&gt;Ancient of Days took his seat&lt;/mark&gt;; his &lt;mark&gt;clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool&lt;/mark&gt;; his throne was fiery flames; its wheels were burning fire. (10) A stream of fire issued and came out from before him; a thousand thousands served him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the court sat in judgment, and the books were opened. (11) &amp;ldquo;I looked then because of the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking. And as I looked, the beast was killed, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire. (12) As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time. (13) &amp;ldquo;I saw in the night visions, and behold, &lt;mark&gt;with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man&lt;/mark&gt;, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. (14) And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed. (15) &amp;ldquo;As for me, Daniel, my spirit within me was anxious, and the visions of my head alarmed me. (16) I approached one of those who stood there and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of the things.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(17) &amp;lsquo;These four great beasts are four kings who shall arise out of the earth. (18) But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, forever and ever.&amp;rsquo; (19) &amp;ldquo;Then I desired to know the truth about the fourth beast, which was different from all the rest, exceedingly terrifying, with its teeth of iron and claws of bronze, and which devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet, (20) and about the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn that came up and before which three of them fell, the horn that had eyes and a mouth that spoke great things, and that seemed greater than its companions. (21) As I looked, this horn made war with the saints and prevailed over them, (22) until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High, and the time came when the saints possessed the kingdom. (23) &amp;ldquo;Thus he said: &amp;lsquo;As for the fourth beast, there shall be a fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be different from all the kingdoms, and it shall devour the whole earth, and trample it down, and break it to pieces. (24) As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise, and another shall arise after them; he shall be different from the former ones, and shall put down three kings. (25) He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time. (26) But the court shall sit in judgment, and his dominion shall be taken away, to be consumed and destroyed to the end. (27) And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; his kingdom shall be an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.&amp;rsquo; (28) &amp;ldquo;Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly alarmed me, and my color changed, but I kept the matter in my heart.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One suggestion is that Daniel was alarmed in verse 15 because this was a paradigm shift.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the prevailing view of his day, Messiah was not necessarily a deity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet in verse 13, Daniel sees the Ancient of Days (whom we might call &amp;ldquo;the Father&amp;rdquo;) giving the kingdom, the power, and the glory – where have we heard that phrase before? – to the one like a Son of Man, whom we might identify as Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walton (et al.) notes that Jewish writings from before Jesus viewed the &amp;ldquo;son of man&amp;rdquo; as the Jewish Messiah.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John would have been familiar with these documents, particularly &lt;em&gt;1 Enoch&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, the earliest Christians saw the &amp;ldquo;Son of Man&amp;rdquo; as Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel 10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walton estimates Daniel 7 was 552-549 BCE (Babylonian reign of Belshazzar), and Daniel 10 was 537-536 BCE (Persian reign of Cyrus). He notes Daniel 10 is &amp;ldquo;very close to the time when the first wave of Jews are returning from captivity and beginning the rebuilding of the (second) temple.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Again, note the description of the angelic messenger and Daniel&amp;rsquo;s reaction in verses 5-12 compared with Revelation 1:12-18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;(1) In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a word was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar. And the word was true, and it was a great conflict. And he understood the word and had understanding of the vision. (2) In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three weeks. (3) I ate no delicacies, no meat or wine entered my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, for the full three weeks. (4) On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river (that is, the &lt;mark&gt;Tigris&lt;/mark&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(5) I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, &lt;mark&gt;a man clothed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist. (6) His body was like beryl, his face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; (7) And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great trembling fell upon them, and they fled to hide. (8) So I was left alone and saw this great vision, and no strength was left in me. My radiant appearance was fearfully changed, and I retained no strength. &lt;strong&gt;(9) Then I heard the sound of his words, and as I heard the sound of his words, I fell on my face in deep sleep with my face to the ground. (10) And behold, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees. (11) And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;O Daniel, man greatly loved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for now I have been sent to you.&amp;rdquo; And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up trembling. (12) Then he said to me, &amp;ldquo;Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand and humbled yourself before your God, your words have been heard, and I have come because of your words.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(13) The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days, but Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I was left there with the kings of Persia, (14) and came to make you understand what is to happen to your people in the latter days. For the vision is for days yet to come.&amp;rdquo; (15) When he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground and was mute. (16) And behold, one in the &lt;mark&gt;likeness of the children of man&lt;/mark&gt; touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke. I said to him who stood before me, &amp;ldquo;O my lord, by reason of the vision pains have come upon me, and I retain no strength. (17) How can my lord&amp;rsquo;s servant talk with my lord? For now no strength remains in me, and no breath is left in me.&amp;rdquo; (18) Again one having the appearance of a man touched me and strengthened me. (19) And he said, &amp;ldquo;O man greatly loved, fear not, peace be with you; be strong and of good courage.&amp;rdquo; And as he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, &amp;ldquo;Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.&amp;rdquo; (20) Then he said, &amp;ldquo;Do you know why I have come to you? But now I will return to fight against the prince of Persia; and when I go out, behold, the prince of Greece will come. (21) But I will tell you what is inscribed in the book of truth: there is none who contends by my side against these except Michael, your prince.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12. I turned around to see who was speaking to me; and when I had turned, I saw seven gold menorahs;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Exodus 37:23 And he made its seven lamps and its tongs and its trays of pure gold. Zec 4:2 And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;What do you see?&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember back in verse 10, John heard a great voice behind him. Here he turns to look.
&lt;img src=&#34;images/f37a1158a991a6a4d9acb4a8284cc1ff.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your Bible may say, &amp;ldquo;lampstands or candlesticks,&amp;rdquo; but what John sees is unquestionably a menorah, as Stern translated in the CJB.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He renders as &amp;ldquo;seven menorahs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A menorah has seven branches; this is one Menorah with seven lights. To the right is a photo I took of the Temple Institute Menorah in2013.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later, we will find out that each &amp;ldquo;candlestick&amp;rdquo; is a congregation with Jesus in the midst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Menorah is also reminiscent of a tree or a vine with branches.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus is the vine, and we are the branches (John 15).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus is also the light of the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, the tabernacle/temple menorah was made of gold, which fits with verse 12.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Missler, this scene should remind us of the Tabernacle.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The robe and gold band in verse 13 may allude to the High Priest (Exodus 28:4).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The high priest was the one who tended the Menorah, including snuffing out and correcting if unsatisfactory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lizorkin says, &amp;ldquo;the presence of the Temple menorah would signal to John&amp;rsquo;s audience that his visionary experience took place in the vicinity of the Temple. And more precisely in the inner section of the Temple.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Temple/Tabernacle Menorah also testifies to God&amp;rsquo;s presence.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seven fellowships are supposed to live in such a way that their communities see God&amp;rsquo;s light and presence.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Num 7:89 And when Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with the LORD, he heard the voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim; and it spoke to him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-113-one-like-a-son-of-man&#34;&gt;Rev 1:13: One Like a Son of Man&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Revelation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13. and among the menorahs was someone like a Son of Man, wearing a robe down to his feet and a gold band around his chest&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Exo 28:4 These are the garments that they shall make: a breast piece, an ephod, a robe, a coat of checker work, a turban, and a sash. They shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother and his sons to serve me as priests.  &lt;br&gt;Dan 7:13 &amp;ldquo;I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came &lt;mark&gt;one like a son of man&lt;/mark&gt;, and he came to the &lt;mark&gt;Ancient of Days&lt;/mark&gt; and was presented before him. Dan 10:5 I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, a man clothed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist. &lt;br&gt;Dan 10:16 And behold, &lt;mark&gt;one in the likeness of the children of man&lt;/mark&gt; touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke. I said to him who stood before me, &amp;ldquo;O my lord, by reason of the vision pains have come upon me, and I retain no strength.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is often called the &amp;ldquo;vision of the Risen Christ.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that John noted one dressed as a priest in the &amp;ldquo;midst&amp;rdquo; of the Menorah may suggest he was witnessing Jesus as High Priest in heavenly Tabernacle (Heb 9).
&lt;img src=&#34;images/0fab3a7bee3b9b8d1fbc99ce645b1a4a.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The photo shows the &amp;ldquo;Holy Place,&amp;rdquo; where the Menorah was located. In the foreground is the Table of Showbread. By the curtain leading to the Holy of Holies is the Altar of Incense. (Ex 26:33)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is from a Tabernacle replica that one can visit near Eilat, Israel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, John does NOT identify Jesus but says &amp;ldquo;one like a Son of Man.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John and Jesus were very close during Jesus&#39; earthly ministry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presumably, He would have said, &amp;ldquo;and among the Menorahs was Jesus wearing a robe…&amp;quot;…but he didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We know from 1:1 and 22:8 that John is not talking directly with Jesus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This angelic divine being is at the same time Jesus but not quite Jesus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we saw from some of the parallel passages, the description of the one like a Son of Man is inherited from the Ancient of Days.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Baruch Korman writes, &amp;ldquo;This is a depiction of Messiah taking on the mantle of God the father.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Lizorkin writes, &amp;ldquo;The garments are highly symbolic, showing that Jesus is the heavenly priest, fully prepared and qualified to carry out His duties.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Keener writes, &amp;ldquo;the cumulative impact of these images is to present the risen Jesus as the greatest conceivable figure.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are numerous parallels among Revelation 1:12-18, Daniel 7, Daniel 10, and to a lesser extent, Ezekiel 1 and even Matthew 17 and the Transfiguration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will compare Revelation 1 and Daniel 10 towards the end of the lesson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus physically is seated at the Right Hand of the Father
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This may explain why it appears to be an Angel and not Jesus directly who speaks with John.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus is to remain seated at the Right Hand until the appointed time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In either case, Jesus is also spiritually amid our fellowships and us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember also that the earthly fellowships were undergoing intense persecution. Perhaps they felt abandoned by God, but here we see God is right in their midst.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Eze 1:&lt;strong&gt;7, 24&lt;/strong&gt; Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf&amp;rsquo;s foot. And they sparkled like burnished bronze. &lt;strong&gt;24&lt;/strong&gt; And when they went, I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of many waters, like the sound of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of an army. When they stood still, they let down their wings. &lt;strong&gt;Eze 43:2&lt;/strong&gt; And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east. And the sound of his coming was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone with his glory.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;16. In his right hand he held seven stars, out of his mouth went a sharp double-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in full strength.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jdg 5:31 &amp;ldquo;So may all your enemies perish, O LORD! But your friends be like the sun as he rises in his might.&amp;rdquo; Isa 49:2 He made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand he hid me; he made me a polished arrow; in his quiver he hid me away. Heb 4:12 For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We occasionally see drawings, some quite grotesque in my opinion, of Jesus with a literal sword coming out of His mouth. This misses the point entirely. Obviously, the sword is symbolic. As Lizorkin says, &amp;ldquo;this being is powerful enough to destroy with his voice alone.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early Jewish believers saw the two edges as two aspects of the Word of God
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either the &amp;ldquo;law and the prophets&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Moses and Jesus.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, Reformation theology sees &amp;ldquo;Law&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Gospel&amp;rdquo; as opposites. They are not. The opposite of &amp;ldquo;law&amp;rdquo; is not &amp;ldquo;grace&amp;rdquo; but &amp;ldquo;lawlessness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If this is the model, here we see that Law and Gospel are not opposed to each other but are two sides of the same sword&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both bring judgment for the wicked and life for the righteous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Baruch pointed out that a sword also divides and separates, in the sense that in Genesis 1:4, God divided the light from the darkness.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I saw a meme recently that the light never flees in the face of darkness. It is the darkness that runs when confronted by light. For darkness to prevail, the light source must be removed. John 3:19 has more about this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Dan 8:17-18 So he came near where I stood. And when he came, I was frightened and fell on my face. But he said to me, &amp;ldquo;Understand, O son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end.&amp;rdquo; 18 And when he had spoken to me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground. But he touched me and made me stand up.  Dan 10:9-10,12,15 followed by Dan 10:19 And he said, &amp;ldquo;O man greatly loved, fear not, peace be with you; be strong and of good courage.&amp;rdquo; And as he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, &amp;ldquo;Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a common reaction when people in the Bible are given a glimpse of God – even if it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; an angel, they are terrified!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The drawing on the right illustrates Abraham bowing before angelic visitors, one of whom is the &amp;ldquo;Angel of the Lord.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of our Bibles have from 1:17 through the end of chapter 3 in red text; the translators assume Jesus is speaking. It&amp;rsquo;s a fair assumption; however, if we&amp;rsquo;re faithful to the text, John does not record who is speaking.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 1:1 and Rev 22:8 tell us John received the vision from an Angel, not from Jesus directly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuming this is John the Apostle, he knew Jesus better than anyone. Was he afraid because this incredible and terrifying being wasn&amp;rsquo;t Jesus?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if we assume it was Jesus, there is a lesson.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No matter how well you know Jesus, He&amp;rsquo;s still God. We can&amp;rsquo;t get too casual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CS Lewis captures this beautifully in &amp;ldquo;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.&amp;rdquo; Susan Pevensie is talking to Mr. Beaver. &amp;ldquo;Aslan is a lion- the Lion, the great Lion.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Ooh,&amp;rdquo; said Susan. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d thought he was a man. Is he-quite safe? I shall feel rather nervous about meeting a lion&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Safe&lt;/strong&gt;?&amp;rdquo; said Mr. Beaver &lt;strong&gt;&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;Who said anything about safe? &amp;lsquo;Course he isn&amp;rsquo;t safe&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;But he&amp;rsquo;s good&lt;/strong&gt;. He&amp;rsquo;s the King, I tell you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In any case, the angel has the authority to speak for Jesus and God the Father in the 1st person.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we look back in Genesis, the &amp;ldquo;Angel of the LORD&amp;rdquo; in the Old Testament has the authority to speak for the Father in the first person. It&amp;rsquo;s as if Abraham is communicating with God Himself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe that is the case with John. The text tells us John is not speaking with Jesus directly, but he might as well be since He&amp;rsquo;s the only One who purchased our life with His death&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The safest avenue is to say John is speaking with an Angel of the God of Israel, acknowledging some elasticity in our definitions of the Father, Spirit, and Son.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-118-i-was-dead-but-behold-i-am-alive&#34;&gt;Rev 1:18: &amp;ldquo;I was dead but behold, I Am alive!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Isa 25:8 He will swallow up death forever; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from all faces, and the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for the LORD has spoken.  Hos 13:14 I shall ransom them from the power of Sheol; I shall redeem them from death. O death, where are your plagues? O Sheol, where is your sting?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1 Corinthians 15:54, Paul says, &amp;ldquo;the saying will come about as it is written, &amp;ldquo;Death is swallowed up in victory!&amp;rdquo; He was quoting Isaiah 25:8. The words spoken to John appear linked to this passage also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the great find of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1948 in a cave by the Dead Sea: a complete and relatively intact scroll containing the book of Isaiah. Before this, the most recent full copy of the Hebrew Bible we had was from the 9th or 10th century CE. This scroll dates to 1000 years prior, the 1st Century before Christ, or before the Common Era. There are minor differences only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Conservative scholars tend to see this as an Outline of the book, though this is debated:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you see: the Vision of the Risen Christ – chapter 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The things which are: the seven assemblies/churches - chapters 2-3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The things that shall be after – chapters 4-22&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Greek phrase for &amp;ldquo;after these things&amp;rdquo; is μετα ταυτα meta tauta.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meta tauta acts as a signpost throughout Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Rev 1:19 Write therefore the things that you have seen, those that are and those that are to take place &lt;mark&gt;after this&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 4:1 &lt;mark&gt;After this&lt;/mark&gt; I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 4:1 And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place &lt;mark&gt;after this&lt;/mark&gt;.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 7:1 &lt;mark&gt;after this&lt;/mark&gt; I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, that no wind might blow on earth or sea or against any tree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 7:9 &lt;mark&gt;after this&lt;/mark&gt; I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 9:12 The first woe has passed; behold, two woes are &lt;mark&gt;still to come&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 15:5 &lt;mark&gt;after this&lt;/mark&gt; I looked, and the sanctuary of the tent of witness in heaven was opened&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 18:1 &lt;mark&gt;after this&lt;/mark&gt; I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was made bright with his glory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 19:1 &lt;mark&gt;after this&lt;/mark&gt; I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, crying out, “Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 20:3 and threw him (Satan) into the pit, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he might not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were ended. &lt;mark&gt;After that&lt;/mark&gt; he must be released for a little while.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Tens in the Bible&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are not seven but 10 μετα ταυτα phrases in Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Hebrew Gematria, specific numbers that reappear throughout the Bible are assigned concepts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gematria means that scholars, both ancient sages and modern academics, have studied these patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where they see seven, they notice a general theme of completion or perfection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using this method, 10 represents divine order or law,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most obvious examples are the 10 commandments and the 10 plagues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were also 10 generations from Adam to Noah, where we saw the flood restoring order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were also 10 generations from Noah to Abraham where we received the Abrahamic covenant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Ruth 4, there is a strange prophecy given to Ruth and Boaz, followed by a list of 10 generations from Perez to King David.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ruth 4:12 and may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring that the LORD will give you by this young woman.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you know the story of Tamar and Judah, it&amp;rsquo;s sordid. If you received this &amp;ldquo;blessing,&amp;rdquo; you might be inclined to think &amp;ldquo;same to you, fella!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perez was the product of a &amp;ldquo;forbidden union&amp;rdquo; between Tamar and Judah, her father in-law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deuteronomy 23:2 - &amp;ldquo;No one born of a forbidden union may enter the assembly of the LORD. Even to the &lt;em&gt;tenth&lt;/em&gt; generation, none of his descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The backstory is Tamar&amp;rsquo;s previous husbands (Judah&amp;rsquo;s other sons) had died without issue, and it was Judah&amp;rsquo;s responsibility to see that his line continued.  He failed to do this, so Tamar posed as a prostitute and went into to Judah.  Of course, she became pregnant by him.  When Judah found out that his daughter in law had played the harlot, he was furious.  He was about to have her executed when she presented evidence that he was the father of the child.  Oops.  The son&amp;rsquo;s name was Perez.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The end of Ruth connects the dots for us by listing 10 generations from Perez to David the King.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a spiritual perspective, this was yet another attempt by Satan to sabotage the lineage of Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tamar perhaps unknowingly, saw to it that the line continued, and indeed she is one of the four women noted in Jesus&#39; genealogy (Matthew 1:3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-120-the-meaning-of-the-starsmenorah&#34;&gt;Rev 1:20: The Meaning of the Stars/Menorah&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;20. Here is the secret meaning of the seven stars you saw in my right hand, and of the seven gold menorahs: the seven stars are the angels of the seven Messianic communities, and the seven menorahs are the seven Messianic communities.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Zech 4: 2 And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;What do you see?&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/06d103558029ba8fd995cd8e7e4bea39.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A topic of debate is whether the seven stars/angels are natural or supernatural&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About all the &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; camp has going for it is our western minds can understand it better.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this view, the angels of each congregation are human.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More than likely, the messenger would be the pastor of each community or a designated reader in the synagogue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, no church leadership position is ever called an angel or messenger anywhere else in the New Testament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In favor of the supernatural angel view, the entire book of Revelation has angels everywhere, so why not in Chapters 2 and 3?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewish texts often portray angels as stars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this view, churches/fellowships have designated angels just like nations do.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Daniel 10, the angelic messenger had to do battle with the spirit of Persia and then had to go back to do battle with the spirit of Greece.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, there is a heavenly counterpart to an earthly reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Admittedly it is foreign to think of a fellowship having a &amp;ldquo;guardian angel.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If our churches had such an angel, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it keep false teaching and division out of the church?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protestants tend to deemphasize angels, which is odd given that &amp;ldquo;angels&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;angel&amp;rdquo; appears over 180 times in the New Testament- about 80 times in Revelation and the other 100 in the rest of the New Testament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is probably much more going on in the supernatural angelic community than most of us realize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In both Hebrew and Greek, the meaning could be either a supernatural angel or a natural messenger. However, only about six times out of the 180 can we be certain that the word references only a human messenger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This certainly raises several questions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do churches today have designated angels?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was this a 1st-century phenomenon?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was it ONLY these seven specially designated congregations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who knows!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By having the stars in his right hand, the hand of power, John is possibly communicating, &amp;ldquo;Christ is Lord over the universe including Lord over the angels who guide the churches as well as the nations.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keener also notes given the tensions between non-messianic and messianic branches of Judaism in that day, &amp;ldquo;by identifying the churches as (a menorah), John claims that the Jesus movement is the true form of Judaism.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One thing we do know: a menorah&amp;rsquo;s purpose is to give off light in a dark place
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is what our churches should be doing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is what we as disciples should be doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a postscript, let&amp;rsquo;s do a quick side-by-side of Revelation 1 and Daniel 10. In this way, we can see how the book we hold in our laps or in our smart devices is ONE book with one consistent message from beginning to end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;State of preparation&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The being&amp;rsquo;s clothing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5 clothed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13 clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash around his chest.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Head/face&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6 his face like the appearance of lightning, (Dan 7:9 the hair of his head like pure wool)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14 The hairs of his head were white, like white wool, like snow.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Eyes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6 his eyes like flaming torches&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14 His eyes were like a flame of fire,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Arms &amp;amp; Legs/Feet&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6 his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15 his feet were like burnished bronze, refined in a furnace,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Voice&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6 the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15 and his voice was like the roar of many waters.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Reaction&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt; as I heard the sound of his words, I fell on my face in deep sleep with my face to the ground.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17 When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Commission&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; And behold, a hand touched me&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17 But he laid his right hand on me,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Assurance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt; Then he said to me, &amp;ldquo;Fear not, Daniel,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17 saying, &amp;ldquo;Fear not, I am the first and the last, 18 and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lesson will discuss the structure of each of the Seven Letters.  We will also review several approaches to application including three conjectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our fifth lesson in Revelations backgrounds will introduce the seven letters in chapters 2-3. Each letter follows an intricate and nearly identical outline. Understanding this at the outset will help us as we seek to unpack each letter. Next, we will look at several application layers and the commonly taught &amp;ldquo;church age&amp;rdquo; conjecture. We will also look at the often confusing and misunderstood phrases, &amp;ldquo;the Nicolaitans,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;those who say they are Jews but are not,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the synagogue of Satan.&amp;rdquo; Since these phrases occur in multiple letters, we will deal with them upfront. Ultimately Scripture does not define these. We will strive to leverage what we ARE told from Scripture &amp;ndash; and we do get some clues &amp;ndash; with what was going on in that society at the time to make an educated guess that may be different from what is commonly taught. Acts 17:11 says, don&amp;rsquo;t take my word for it but test these theories to see whether these things could be so. As we mentioned in an earlier lesson, our job is not to tell you WHAT to think. It&amp;rsquo;s to get you TO think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-sevenfold-structure-of-each-letter&#34;&gt;The Sevenfold Structure of Each Letter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will find that the letters follow a sequence of seven elements. 1. Name of the city (addressee), 2. An attribute of the Glorified Messiah from 1:12-20 (addresser), 3. Praise that usually begins with &amp;ldquo;I know…&amp;rdquo;, 4. Judgment, 5. Encouragement, 6. A promise to the overcomer, 7. &amp;ldquo;He who has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener notes: &amp;ldquo;Some scholars have compared the elements of the form to Old Testament and ancient Near Eastern covenant formulas; if they are correct, the prophecies here may act like the covenant lawsuits common in the Old Testament prophets (e.g., in Amos 2–4). They may also function analogously to a series of oracles against the nations common in the Old Testament prophets (e.g., Isaiah 13–23; Jer 46–51; Ezek 25–32; especially the eight brief oracles of Amos 1–2).&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We examine each element in greater detail and describe more about the judgment aspect, as commentators often overlook this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-name-of-the-city&#34;&gt;1. Name of the City&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; (1) &amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Ephesus, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message…&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first element is always addressed to the angel of the assembly at each of the cities. We&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in previous lessons that there is scholarly debate as to whether the angel is supernatural or is a human messenger. For our purposes, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter as the body of each letter deals with the behaviors of the human body of believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning of the city&amp;rsquo;s name often is revealing. For example, Ephesus means &amp;ldquo;darling&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;darling one,&amp;rdquo; yet this is the church that lost its first love, and the Greek word used is Agape, a completely devoted type of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we go through each city in subsequent Revelation Background lessons, we will present some of the background history, enhancing our understanding of what God communicates to the fellowship. Keener writes, &amp;ldquo;Ancient cities were fiercely proud of their own history and culture and would be more sensitive to local allusions than most readers today would be.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-a-specific-attribute-of-messiah&#34;&gt;2. A specific attribute of Messiah&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven gold menorahs: &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second element is a specific attribute of the one who is sending the letter. The speaker is never identified as Jesus, but we&amp;rsquo;ll say it&amp;rsquo;s Jesus the Messiah in his risen and glorified form even though we know John received the revelation through an angel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attributes typically tie back to the description of this heavenly being in Revelation 1:12-20. There is one slight deviation in the letter to Philadelphia where He says He has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens. Revelation 1:18 mentions the Keys to death and hades but not the Key of David. Any deviations should get our attention. We&amp;rsquo;ll unpack this when we get to Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-specific-praise-that-begins-with-i-know&#34;&gt;3. Specific Praise that begins with &amp;ldquo;I know….&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; (2) &amp;ldquo;I know what you have been doing, how hard you have worked, how you have persevered, and how you can&amp;rsquo;t stand wicked people; so you tested those who call themselves emissaries but aren&amp;rsquo;t—and you found them to be liars. (3) You are persevering, and you have suffered for my sake without growing weary. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third attribute in each letter is praise. If I read this like an audit report from my corporate auditing days, this would be an attribute that was tested and found to have met the standard. It is something Jesus approves of and encourages us to keep on doing. In some letters, it is apparent that something they think is wrong, Jesus believes is good. To Smyrna, Jesus writes, &amp;ldquo;I know your poverty, but you are rich.&amp;rdquo; They likely did not see themselves as rich, but Jesus says they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every letter follows this sevenfold structure, and it will get our attention when there are deviations. Two letters are conspicuous because they have no praise. These are the 5th and 7th letters: Sardis and Laodicea. Something is seriously wrong with these churches. We&amp;rsquo;ll find out what those things are when we get to those cities. We also note that the &amp;ldquo;I know&amp;rdquo; beginning now precedes the judgment for these two assemblies.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-judgment&#34;&gt;4. Judgment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; (4) But I have this against you: you have lost the love you had at first. (5) Therefore, remember where you were before you fell, turn from this sin, and do what you used to do before. Otherwise, I will come to you and remove your menorah from its place—if you don&amp;rsquo;t turn from your sin! &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth element of Jesus&amp;rsquo; report card is what we might benignly call an improvement opportunity, although we must note Jesus uses much harsher words. This is God pronouncing a judgment. In the example of Ephesus, their deficiency, loss of the love they had at first, is nothing less than a sin which they must repent of at the expense of losing their light. And since Jesus is in the midst of that light, He&amp;rsquo;s saying he&amp;rsquo;s going to remove Ephesus from his midst. That&amp;rsquo;s serious. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a C on the report card; it&amp;rsquo;s not even an F. It&amp;rsquo;s a zero. It&amp;rsquo;s so severe that many commentators believe a loss of salvation is in view for people who don&amp;rsquo;t repent (or we could say people who don&amp;rsquo;t repent even after Jesus tells them to do not show evidence of saving faith).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are very analogous to the judgment pronouncements in the Old Testament. One of the more familiar of these is Jonah. Jonah was called to go to Nineveh, the hated and brutal regime of the day, and pronounce a judgment. He didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go, which was a whale of a tale. Ba-dum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message Jonah was to deliver was that the all-knowing, all-powerful God of Israel knows what wickedness has been occurring in Ninevah, and His patience is not infinite. Judgment is coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judgments like these usually have an expressed or implied safety valve. If the recipient repents, the Judgment will be withheld. We see that in this letter to Ephesus. &amp;ldquo;Remember where you were, repent, and do what you used to do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonah didn&amp;rsquo;t even get to this part of his oracle to Nineveh. The town&amp;rsquo;s leaders understood that repenting was the only way to avert disaster. Which they did, causing Jonah to pout some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who teach that the God of the Old Testament is vengeful and judgmental while the God of the New is all about grace have apparently never read Revelation 2 and 3. They probably have not read much of the Old Testament either. We see God&amp;rsquo;s grace and mercy at the very beginning in the Garden of Eden. God is most gracious, most merciful, and cannot tolerate sin. All are true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as two churches had no praise, two other churches, Smyrna and Philadelphia, have no deficiency. This is one reason everyone wants to think they are part of the church of Philadelphia (but remember, the difference between how we see ourselves and how Jesus sees us is a significant theme throughout each letter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of personal application, if any of Jesus&amp;rsquo; words of judgment to the seven assemblies pinch us a little, we need to repent and get that corrected. As a talmid, I must serve at His pleasure faithfully. If He tells me I need to improve, I know I better improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-encouragement&#34;&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Encouragement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; (6) But you have this in your favor: you hate what the Nicolaitans do—I hate it too. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5th element is encouragement, or, we might say, additional (or secondary) praise. Jesus will follow up his condemnation with a note of encouragement. In some cases, the secondary encouragement is directed to a specific subset of the congregation where perhaps only a few are doing the thing Jesus approves of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We mentioned Sardis and Laodicea do not have any praise. Sardis still has an encouragement that is extremely limited in its scope. For Laodicea, the encouragement takes a different form of a plea, which we&amp;rsquo;ll get to down the road. Pergamum has praise, but they get no secondary encouragement statement. Again, exceptions to the usual pattern need to get our attention. Something is very wrong at Pergamum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the general rule is a 2:1 ratio of praise and encouragement to deficiencies. If your job involves supervising others, auditing, or parenting, this is great to remember. It indicates the deliverer of the bad news cares about the recipients and is not just being a disciplinarian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-promise-to-the-overcomer&#34;&gt;6. Promise to the Overcomer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; To him winning the victory I will give the right to eat from the Tree of Life which is in God&amp;rsquo;s Gan-`Eden.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many translations have &amp;ldquo;to the overcomer.&amp;rdquo; Stern borrows from Paul and phrases it, &amp;ldquo;to him winning the victory.&amp;rdquo; The book of Revelation is about being an overcomer. The entire Christian walk of discipleship (the &amp;ldquo;talmidim way&amp;rdquo;) is about being an overcomer. Romans 12:2 says, &amp;quot; Do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does raise some interesting theological questions. Most commentators assume the letters are addressed to believers. If so, is Jesus saying that there will be some believers who will NOT be overcomers? If so, in Ephesus&#39; case, does that mean there will be believers who do not eat from the Tree of Life?&amp;rdquo; Other commentators see this promise as a forfeit of rewards, not salvation. The counterargument is that eating the tree of life appears to be the only way to avoid the second death. How can one say that one is saved if one can&amp;rsquo;t eat the Tree of Life and avoid the second death? Dr. Fruchtenbaum has what may be a more straightforward rationale. Many assume these letters are written to believers only. Fruchtenbaum points out that these 1st-century fellowships probably had unbelievers alongside believers, just like today&amp;rsquo;s congregations. This may have included some intentional imposters that slipped in as well as people who sincerely believe they are saved, but to whom Jesus will say, &amp;ldquo;depart from me. I never knew you.&amp;rdquo; The overcomers would be those who are genuinely saved, and the non-overcomers would be unsaved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entire debate is easily solved by putting our trust in Jesus. He said, &amp;ldquo;if you love Me, keep my commands.&amp;rdquo; One of His commands is to abide in Him. If we abide in Him and help others do the same, then whether the manmade doctrine of eternal security is true is ultimately relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;7-he-who-has-an-ear&#34;&gt;7. He who has an ear&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;(7) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the Messianic communities.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last component is every letter will have this identical phrase &amp;ldquo;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies or churches&amp;rdquo; This is an exciting statement. Each letter begins directed to a specific congregation, but each ends with an individual application (you and I have ears to hear) and application to all churches. He didn&amp;rsquo;t say here what the spirit is saying to &amp;ldquo;Ephesus&amp;rdquo;; he said Hear what the spirit is saying to the communities. OR your bible probably has &amp;ldquo;what the Spirit says to the churches&amp;rdquo; plural. We&amp;rsquo;ll talk more about the application in the next section. This is a warning for all believers to hear and obey Jesus&#39; words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have 6 and 7 flipped intentionally because the promise comes first in the last four letters, and the letter closes with &amp;ldquo;he who has an ear.&amp;rdquo; The first three are like Ephesus; he who has an ear is followed by the promise. We aren&amp;rsquo;t told from the text why this is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of my professional career first auditing then running audit and monitoring programs. These letters read very much like an audit report - you have the &amp;ldquo;to&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;from,&amp;rdquo; and as auditors, we always give our credentials. Credentials are what makes us an expert in the field. Jesus is giving his judgment credentials. We then present those items that met the standard and those deficiencies that require remediation or corrective action (deficiencies noted were judgments of sorts). Those would be sections 3, 4, and 5of each letter. Then there is always a section on the next steps - we&amp;rsquo;ll recommend to the board that you&amp;rsquo;re good to go for another three years, or maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll recommend to operations that if they can&amp;rsquo;t fix the problem, they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be in the business. I see that as roughly equivalent to the promise to the overcomer. (I never said, &amp;ldquo;if you have eyes to see, you must read my report,&amp;rdquo; but I wish I could have).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;application&#34;&gt;Application&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four surface layers of application and another three within the realm of conjecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four obvious levels are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal (he that has an ear…)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The specific local assembly and its attendees (to the assembly at Ephesus)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All seven assemblies and their attendees (hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All congregations throughout history (hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 21st century, the personal application is the most important. We must resist the temptation to say that each judgment is only for that 1st-century church or some other church I’m not attending. We must make it personal. Let&amp;rsquo;s do some introspective digging. What areas might we need to improve or even repent of in our lives to align them with Jesus&#39; expectations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe the fourth application is valid because there appear to be components in some of the letters that go beyond the local situation and, in some cases, do not appear to apply to the local situation at all. We will highlight these as we get to the specifics of each letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three additional parallels certain scholars have noted. Some connections can be strained in places but, in general, may have value and hint at supernatural design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pauline letter counterpart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matthew 13 parable counterpart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Church Age theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pauline-letter-counterpart&#34;&gt;Pauline letter counterpart&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul also wrote to seven cities (Rome, Corinth, Galatia, Ephesus, Philippi, Colossae, Thessaloniki). The themes in Paul&amp;rsquo;s letters seem to parallel the Seven Letters of Revelation broadly.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later we will look at a passage from Ephesians that appears to fit what we know about Ephesus and applies to the local situation. Ephesus and Laodicea are mentioned explicitly in Ephesians and Colossians, respectively, so those two are natural parings with Jesus&#39; letters to Ephesus and Laodicea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also see that Philippians share some themes with Smyrna&amp;rsquo;s letter regarding suffering. Pergamum talks about a carnal church that&amp;rsquo;s married to the world. Is there a city Paul wrote to that struggled with this? Yep. Corinth. Scholars see connections with Thyatira and Sardis to Galatians and Romans. In some cases, these two can be reversed. Linking Sardis to Romans draws on the Church Age theory discussed below. Philadelphia is the church where everything is going well. Is there a church Paul wrote to where the bulk of the letter is praise and encouragement? That would be Thessalonians. Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s interesting even if they aren&amp;rsquo;t perfect fits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ephesus - Ephesians 4:17-32 parallels Jesus&#39; words to Ephesus - Eph 4:14  so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smyrna - Philippians - Joy through suffering - Php 1:29  For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake / Php 4:4  Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pergamum - Corinthians - Married to the world - 1Co 5:1  It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thyatira - Galatians - Religious externalism themes - Gal 1:6  I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sardis - Romans - Don&amp;rsquo;t know they are dead / don&amp;rsquo;t walk the talk - Rom 3:10-12  as it is written: “None is righteous, no, not one;  (11)  no one understands; no one seeks for God.  (12)  All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Philadelphia - Thessalonians - praiseworthy fellowships - 1Th 2:19  For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laodicea - Colossians - Lukewarm/told to exchange letters - Col 3:2  Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;matthew-13-parable-counterpart&#34;&gt;Matthew 13 Parable counterpart&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the parables, it’s the same general thought. Thyatira deals with a woman Jezebel. Is there a woman featured in one of the parables? Yes - it&amp;rsquo;s the woman with the leaven, a type of sin. To Laodicea, Jesus says he will &amp;ldquo;spew&amp;rdquo; them out of his mouth. Is there a parable that deals with rejecting and casting out? That would be the parable of the Dragnet where the good fish are kept, and the rotten fish are cast away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the Pauline letter counterparts, some connections may be strained. If nothing else, doing Acts 17:11 diligence will cause us to look into Paul&amp;rsquo;s letters and Matthew&amp;rsquo;s parables to see whether these things be so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ephesians - Four soils - identify believers from unbelievers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smyrna - Tares and the wheat - Suffering by the children of the wicked one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pergamum - Mustard Seed - Becomes something it was never intended to be; the birds of the air (ministers of Satan) can nest inside&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thyatira - Woman with Leaven - Only letter/parable that mentions a woman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sardis - Treasure in the field - a few in Sardis will have treasure in heaven&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Philadelphia - Pearl of Great Price - A pearl is an item of adornment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laodicea - Dragnet - spew/cast out the unwanted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;church-age-theory&#34;&gt;Church Age Theory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some scholars make a big deal about the church age theory, but it&amp;rsquo;s not without issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outset, the most common version of the theory holds that all types of churches were always present and, for the most part, are present today. The church assigned to the age happens to be the dominant or at least the predominant church of that given period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ephesus - Apostolic - 70-170&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smyrna - Persecuted - 170 -312&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pergamum - Compromised/Licentious (married to the world) - 312 - 606
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What Satan couldn&amp;rsquo;t destroy by persecution, he tried to kill by erosion from within&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christianity became the state religion under Constantine II - went from pacifist to conquering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byzantine period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thyatira - Papal (Catholic) Church - 606- Present
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boniface II first universal Pope in 606&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tolerate Jezebel - pagan/non-biblical practices infiltrate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medieval period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sardis - Protestant Church - 1517-Present
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NAME (deNOMination) that they are alive but are dead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reformation/Enlightenment period (95 Theses 1517)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Philadelphia - Missionary/Faithful - 1750-Present
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A time when doors were open to the spread of the Gospel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, it corresponds to freedom movements in America, France, and elsewhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It tends to be &amp;ldquo;The church I am attending&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laodicea - Comfortable/Lukewarm - 1900-Present
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short sermons and comfy chairs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sincerely half-hearted believers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conforms to society&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It tends to be &amp;ldquo;The church someone I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with is attending&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we can say that all churches were always present. We know for a fact that Laodicea was present in the apostolic age; Jesus said so! Also, today, which would be the Laodicean age, many Christians worldwide are persecuted the way Smyrna was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unquestionably, this interpretation would not have occurred to John or the original audience, so we need to tread lightly. One issue is it is only limited to the western/European church (to be precise, the churches founded in lands occupied by the western part of the Roman empire and its successors). The eastern faith traditions are not present, many of which are very different from ours. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to find a slot for the Egyptian Coptics, Armenian Orthodox, or African variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the theory applied today results in a bit of &amp;ldquo;us and them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every believer sees him or herself as part of the church of Philadelphia (the missionary and faithful church) and anyone they disagree with as part of the church of Laodicea (the apostate church).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the themes of the letters is how we see ourselves and how Jesus sees us are not necessarily aligned - so many who think they are Philadelphia may not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if every church today is either Laodicea or Philadelphia, we would have only needed two churches in Revelation, not seven. We&amp;rsquo;ll touch on this but hold to it lightly as we go through each city. It&amp;rsquo;s much more vital that we look ourselves in the mirror as we read each letter than categorize different churches according to the Church Age Theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(1) &amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Ephesus, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven gold menorahs: (2) &amp;ldquo;I know what you have been doing, how hard you have worked, how you have persevered, and how you can&amp;rsquo;t stand wicked people; so you tested those who call themselves emissaries but aren&amp;rsquo;t—and you found them to be liars. (3) You are persevering, and you have suffered for my sake without growing weary. (4) But I have this against you: you have lost the love you had at first. (5) Therefore, remember where you were before you fell, turn from this sin, and do what you used to do before. Otherwise, I will come to you and remove your menorah from its place—if you don&amp;rsquo;t turn from your sin! (6) But you have this in your favor: you hate what the Nicolaitans do—I hate it too. (7) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities. To him winning the victory I will give the right to eat from the Tree of Life which is in God&amp;rsquo;s Gan-`Eden.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ephesus was known as the &amp;ldquo;Queen of Asia&amp;rdquo; for its wealth and beauty. Its location meant it could serve as an essential waypoint from Rome to the eastern provinces, either by sea or land. A network of Roman roads connected the seven messianic assemblies. They also eventually linked up with routes leading to Asia proper, including Israel, the Fertile Crescent, and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/e2148e2e2d165d8bdab7dd37acbd2df6.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
During the Roman Empire, Ephesus was a significant harbor village. On the map inset, you can see estimations of the shoreline from 500 BCE to 60 CE to the present. The change was caused by dramatic silting from the Cayster River, making the modern harbor useless. The photo below the map shows the swampy area of the Roman port today.
&lt;img src=&#34;images/b212f4d346b26eab22e6d7c8d72b8189.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photograph shows the Great Theater (with seating up to 25,000) with the street that led to the now silted harbor. Acts 19:21-41 describes a riot that occurred when devotees of Diana/Artemis said that Paul posed a clear and present danger to their way of life. The theater is where the riot took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The harbor street (shown in the center of the picture) would have been lined with shops on both sides.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There was also a large &amp;ldquo;agora,&amp;rdquo; or marketplace adjacent. &amp;ldquo;This would have been the likeliest place…for Aquila, Priscilla, and Paul to have set up shop for their long stay in Ephesus.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; DeSilva also notes the market &amp;ldquo;was a major note in the flow of goods from the East to Rome. Many of the cargoes listed in Rev 18:12-13 could be found arriving in Ephesus from the East for further transportation west.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We need to imagine how difficult it would have been to live life as a set-apart believer in a thoroughly pagan environment like Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars believe Hittites founded Ephesus in 1400 BCE. Archeologists have excavated remains of an early temple to a mother goddess, a Hittite fertility deity that later morphed into Diana/Artemis. If the name &amp;ldquo;Hittite&amp;rdquo; rings a bell, Uriah, one of David&amp;rsquo;s mighty men, was a Hittite. Uriah had a beautiful wife named Bathsheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ephesus repeatedly picked the wrong side in the Peloponnesian, Persian, and Roman wars. Still, it became a favored city under Rome and competed with Pergamum (and Smyrna to a lesser extent) over which city was most favored by Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;ephesus-and-artemis&#34;&gt;Ephesus and Artemis&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/29cb53aa62f9eec4e1ef5e2b61e9994d.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temple to Artemis/Diana was one of the famous &amp;ldquo;Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.&amp;rdquo; With a footprint of 220&#39; x 425&#39;, It is four times larger than the Parthenon in Athens&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It was first built in the mid-6th century BCE atop previous temples dating to the 8th century (the time of King Hezekiah in Judah). Artemis, called Diana by the Romans, was the virgin goddess of the moon, fertility, and nature. Our &amp;ldquo;mother nature&amp;rdquo; myth likely comes from her. Artemis is the earth goddess, nurturing and fertile. As we can see in the photo,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Artemis is depicted as multi-breasted (or multiple eggs, also a symbol of fertility). She can also be cruel, vindictive, and destructive.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the map above, we can see that the temple was situated about a mile outside the central Roman city. Bolen writes, &amp;quot; This makes sense, given Artemis’s identity as a goddess of the wilds.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Fertility rites involving temple prostitutes were shared, which Paul disrupted in the New Testament period. It appears to have been destroyed around 400 CE. Today not much remains of the site except for a conspicuous pillar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/a7ce2c2fc59b27e13b282f7ef52ee27a.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
This coin[^9] from AD 50 shows how much the city identified with Diana, down to its very economy. This is why the townspeople saw Paul not only as a religious threat but also as an economic one. The reverse shows the cult statue of Diana (Artemis) of Ephesus and identifies it as “Diana of Ephesus” (DIANA EPHESIA). It is believed that this coin was struck at the Ephesus mint around AD 50–51. In addition to the temple to Artemis, there were numerous other temples, including a large structure devoted to the worship of Domitian. We&#39;ve mentioned the persecutions against Christians and Jews, but Domitian was also paranoid that fellow Romans conspired against him. He arrested and terrorized anyone he suspected. As a post-script, Domitian was so hated that upon his death, the citizens of Ephesus tore down the statue of him and scratched his name from inscriptions. 
&lt;p&gt;The population of Ephesus during the New Testament period was believed to have been around 200,000, making Ephesus the fifth largest city in the Roman empire. There was an extensive library there, and the city was known as a center for studying arts and magic. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Of note, there was also an infamous and large brothel in Ephesus.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; All of this possibly gives rise to Paul&amp;rsquo;s comment in Ephesians 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Eph 2:1-3 And you were dead in the trespasses and sins (2) in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience— (3) among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the New Testament period, Ephesus and Miletus rivaled each other for prominence. Still, Miletus was having the same problem of its harbor silting up and turning the area into a malaria-ridden swamp just like Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missler records that the Romans deforested the region, which caused the soil to erode into the rivers, which ended up in the harbor.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today, the coastline is several miles to the west.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The former harbor is an unappealing swamp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ephesus was restored by the Seljuk Turks during the Islamic period but never regained its glory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ephesus-new-testament-history&#34;&gt;Ephesus New Testament History&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church tradition places the Apostle John at Ephesus starting around AD 40. He is believed to have died around 100 and is buried at St. John&amp;rsquo;s Basilica, near the ancient Temple of Artemis. We believe John wrote his epistles and possibly his Gospel from Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common theme of his epistles emphasizes love and warnings about false teachers. The Gospel of John also contains several discourses on love and light. John develops a secondary theme: the Jerusalem establishment is bad shepherds, which is another way of saying false teachers leading the faithful astray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ephesus is likely more familiar to Christians as being connected with Paul and the books of Acts and Ephesians. Acts 18 tells us that Apollos, referenced several times in the New Testament, came to Ephesus knowing only of John the Baptist. Aquila and Priscilla &amp;ldquo;expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.&amp;rdquo; Apollos and Paul narrowly missed each other in Ephesus, having departed for Corinth before Paul arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/d11a5f4ff4359cc074dd9a9438e998d0.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city was also a focus of Paul&amp;rsquo;s third missionary Journey (Acts 19-20, see selected verses below). We can gather that Paul viewed Ephesus as a type of &amp;ldquo;ground zero&amp;rdquo; in the Jewish diaspora. As noted above, Acts 19 records a riot between Paul and those whose livelihood he threatened by turning people towards the one true God. Paul was not afraid to &amp;ldquo;mix it up&amp;rdquo; for the Gospel. This photo shows the Arcadian Way looking back up toward the theater. The acoustics are excellent. Despite the distance of the middle and upper seating sections, a person on the stage speaking in a moderate voice can easily be heard from there. The din of a shouting crowd would have been tremendous. As a testament to Roman engineering, a few excavated and restored theaters are still used today. The Roman theatre at Caesarea in Israel frequently has rock concerts and shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prophetically, Paul told the Ephesian elders to guard against the divisions and false teachings. In Revelation 2, Jesus would later commend the Ephesians for their diligence in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Act 20:27-31 For I did not shrink from proclaiming to you the whole plan of God. (28) &amp;ldquo;Watch out for yourselves, and for all the flock in which the Ruach HaKodesh has placed you as leaders, to shepherd God&amp;rsquo;s Messianic community, which he won for himself at the cost of his own Son&amp;rsquo;s blood. (29) I know that after I leave, savage wolves will come in among you, and they won&amp;rsquo;t spare the flock. (30) &lt;strong&gt;Even from among your own number, men will arise and teach perversions of the truth&lt;/strong&gt;, in order to drag away the talmidim after themselves. (31) So stay alert! Remember that for three years, night and day, with tears in my eyes, I never stopped warning you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeSilva notes the entire book of Revelation, not just the letter to Ephesus, &amp;ldquo;spoke a poignant word to Christians in a city so supportive of the Roman imperial cult and the Roman economy.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We can also understand why Paul faced such a fierce battle here. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t just presenting an alternate worldview as might be when someone converts today. &amp;ldquo;His proclamation of the one and only one God threatened the city&amp;rsquo;s very identity and its claim to fame, not to mention the livelihood of the concessioners like Demetrius whose trade depended on the worship of Artemis.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in Revelation, when John writes of a beast with a religious system that encompassed economic and devotional aspects, his first-century readers would have understood he was communicating Rome and its imperial cult system were thoroughly demonic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ephesus is mentioned 17 times in the New Testament, including twice in Revelation. By contrast, Thyatira is only mentioned one other time in Acts, and Laodicea is mentioned only four other times, all in Colossians. The other four cities are not mentioned elsewhere in the New Testament. Ephesus was the heavy hitter in this group of seven cities. Paul&amp;rsquo;s team likely brought the gospel to these six cities (and beyond) from Ephesus. It is somewhat curious that John and Paul&amp;rsquo;s paths appear not to have crossed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Act 19:1 And it happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the inland country and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act 19:17 And this became known to all the residents of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. And fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was extolled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act 19:26 And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost all of Asia this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great many people, saying that gods made with hands are not gods.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Act 19:34 But as soon as they recognized that he was a Jew, they began bellowing in unison, &amp;ldquo;Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!&amp;rdquo; and they kept it up for about two hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act 19:35 And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, “Men of Ephesus, who is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Artemis, and of the sacred stone that fell from the sky?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act 20:16 For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not have to spend time in Asia, for he was hastening to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(1) &amp;ldquo;To the angel of the (&lt;em&gt;ecclesia)&lt;/em&gt; Messianic Community in Ephesus, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven gold menorahs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mat 18:20 For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.”  Joh 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ecclesia&#34;&gt;Ecclesia&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cities such as Ephesus would likely have had several synagogues. The word &lt;em&gt;ecclesia&lt;/em&gt; reminds us that this is not to a denominational organization or a church building, but a body of believers set apart and called out to be a light in their city. Jesus expects His ecclesia to show evidence they are His, and where they are, there He is among them (Mat 18:20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, he holds them and is present with them. We explored the menorah symbolism previously so we won&amp;rsquo;t repeat it here. We can also draw a comparison to John 1:1 - Jesus is WITH God, meaning alongside and distinct from God the Father, and at the same time, WITH God, meaning He and the Father are indistinguishable. In many ways beyond our explanation, the same relationship is true with Jesus and His ecclesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will find that the English translation of the city name has some significance on the tone and content of each letter. Ephesus means &amp;ldquo;Desired one&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;darling.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This has meaning as later Jesus will say they lost the &amp;ldquo;love they had at first.&amp;rdquo; Commentators often assume Jesus is the darling and once desired One they stopped loving; however, there is another possibility we will explore. Ephesus was also a favored city in the Roman Empire; perhaps this pride had seeped its way into the fellowship. As we noted in the overview, Ephesus was also a place of great learning with an extensive library. However, eternal truth is not found in secular education but in Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;

(3) You are persevering, and you have suffered for my sake without growing weary.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eph&lt;/strong&gt; 4:14 We will then no longer be infants tossed about by the waves and blown along by every wind of teaching, at the mercy of people clever in devising ways to deceive.   Mat 7:23 Then I will tell them to their faces, &amp;lsquo;I never knew you! Get away from me, you workers of lawlessness!&amp;rsquo;   1 John 4:1 Beloved, do not believe every spirit but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 Cor 11:13-15 For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. 14 And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. 15 So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I know your works and your labor&amp;rdquo; is much more to the point. Jesus is passing a judgment on the &lt;strong&gt;results&lt;/strong&gt; of their body of work, what we might collectively call their &amp;ldquo;deeds.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I know what you have been doing&amp;rdquo; sounds like He&amp;rsquo;s only interested in how they have been passing the time. With that said, many Christians might start shaking if Jesus told us, &amp;ldquo;I know what you&amp;rsquo;ve been doing.&amp;rdquo; While that is true in the sense that He sees everything, I think the purpose here is the collective output of the work from the. body of believers. Chuck Missler tells the story of a child panicking when she realizes that Jesus sees her every move. Her grandfather reassured her by saying, &amp;ldquo;Jesus loves you so much, He can&amp;rsquo;t take His eyes off you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice Jesus didn&amp;rsquo;t say &amp;ldquo;I know what you believe&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I know what you profess to be true.&amp;rdquo; While we need to understand God properly, believers won&amp;rsquo;t be judged on how accurate our theology is. We will be judged based on our deeds and whether those deeds were effective for the Kingdom. For believers, this is not a judgment of our salvation but our rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are you and I doing at tolerating wickedness? Do we tolerate it? Wink at it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As discussed in the introduction, the Ephesians headed John&amp;rsquo;s and Paul&amp;rsquo;s warnings to weed out false teachers. Remember that the &amp;ldquo;wicked people,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;liars,&amp;rdquo; the people Paul labels as &amp;ldquo;Savage wolves&amp;rdquo; (Act 20:29), and the people John labels &amp;ldquo;deceivers and antichrists&amp;rdquo; (2 John 1:7) considered themselves to be Christians. It would be unnecessary to test pagans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are folks who called themselves Christians but are not. Later we will meet a group of people who call themselves Jews but are not. The plain sense is obvious. These are imposters, masquerading as members of the faith. Scholars believe this may have been a group called the &amp;ldquo;protognostics&amp;rdquo; or the early gnostics. Gnostics were a heretical offshoot that surprisingly influenced a good portion of early church theology. Note that they were not trying to attack the church but were infiltrating it. More damage to a church is done from within than without. Persecution often causes the true church to grow. It&amp;rsquo;s easier to stand up when you can see the enemy. The problem with church divisions is that the enemy masquerades as a fellow believer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ephesians 4:14, Paul compares a group we might call &amp;ldquo;believers with an agenda&amp;rdquo; to a storm at sea. We aren&amp;rsquo;t told whether they knew they were deceiving or whether their beliefs were genuine but in error. I don&amp;rsquo;t think we can assume all one group or the other. It is probably a mix. The group, along with true charlatans, were self-deceived people, and as a result, they were inadvertently deceiving others. In either case, they came with an agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest person in the whole world to fool is yourself. We said a believer shouldn&amp;rsquo;t fear when reading Revelation, but there is one critically important exception. We need to have a healthy fear of God. Jesus called these believers &amp;ldquo;evil liars.&amp;rdquo; It is to this group; He will speak those terrible words, &amp;ldquo;I never knew you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of which group Jesus had in mind in the first century, a fair question we all should ask from time to time is, &amp;ldquo;I call myself a believer; how do I know Jesus wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call me an evil liar?&amp;rdquo; Am I absolutely sure Jesus won&amp;rsquo;t tell me, &amp;ldquo;depart from me; I never knew you&amp;rdquo;? I see no harm in making sure we are safely NOT in this group. The best companies with nothing to hide still conduct internal and external auditing and monitoring as a way of making certain minor mistakes don’t turn into catastrophic problems. They confidently open their books for inspection. They do not do this from a position of fear. They aren&amp;rsquo;t worried that the auditors might find something. Mature companies EXPECT auditors to find things the company can then correct and become stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no reason, as believers, we should not have the same mindset. This is what Jesus is communicating in the sermon on the mount (Mat 5-7). Allow the Holy Spirit to audit our books. Show us where we are making mistakes so we can be stronger talmidim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ephesians were great external auditors; they could spot fatal flaws in others. However, we&amp;rsquo;re about to find out they were terrible internal auditors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(4) But I have this against you: you have lost the love you had at first. (5) Therefore, remember where you were before you fell, turn from this sin, and do what you used to do before. Otherwise, I will come to you and remove your menorah from its place—if you don&amp;rsquo;t turn from your sin!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jer 2:2 “Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, Thus says the LORD, “I remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride, how you followed me in the wilderness, in a land not sown.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is often described as the loss of love for Jesus, but we must note they were commended for being tested and suffering for His sake without growing weary. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine anyone suffering for Jesus who didn&amp;rsquo;t love him. We don&amp;rsquo;t usually suffer for someone we don&amp;rsquo;t love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternate theory might be as they were testing others, they were all truth and no love. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that they didn&amp;rsquo;t directly love Jesus, but more didn&amp;rsquo;t manifest that love in their treatment of others. They became insular. If we&amp;rsquo;ve been around long enough, we will eventually visit a church like this and probably have met Christians like this. They may teach the word and have the most solid doctrine, but you can feel something is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not just any deficiency. This is a sin that can lead to our light being extinguished. Think about those people who are all rules and have no love. Do you find yourself wanting to be around them? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus says the two greatest commandments are Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 19:18. Both have to do with love. I believe a plausible argument for what was happening at Ephesus was that, in the onslaught of false teachers, they became cynical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sympathetic. They were in an environment where they had to be immediately suspicious of everyone they met. If they weren&amp;rsquo;t believers, were they there to inform against them? If they claimed to be a believer, were they running a con so they could entrap or infiltrate? If their motives were seemingly pure, were they nonetheless one of the false teachers Paul had warned them to weed out? I&amp;rsquo;m not surprised if they tended to become insular and protective. When we are like this, we are not outward-focused. When we are not outward-focused, we are not letting our lights shine. We are not loving our neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is calling them to repent of this and repent now. The mark of a true believer is the ability to repent when he is wrong. The Greek word metanoia, translated as repent, implies changing one&amp;rsquo;s thinking in response in truth. The Hebrew word for repentance, תְשׁוּבָה - teshuva, is more action-oriented. The root means &amp;ldquo;return&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;turn around now!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you do not&amp;rdquo; means we have free will. Although it is difficult to imagine a regenerate believer not responding to Jesus, ultimately we have the freedom to not repent. This verse can be read from several different eternal security perspectives depending on one&amp;rsquo;s pre-established position on the matter. Dr. Fructenbaum points out that, like our fellowships today, 1st-century congregations likely had a mix of true believers and unsaved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;silting&#34;&gt;Silting&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke above how Ephesus lost its prominence, not by majestic conquest, but by gradual silting. The silting occurred gradually; it&amp;rsquo;s doubtful the citizens even noticed. Yet today, what was once a grand harbor is now a marshy swamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Ephesian Christians lost their first love by allowing the silt of spiritual indifference to accumulate over the years. It can happen, can&amp;rsquo;t it? Love for Jesus is the hub from which every other activity (including deeds and doctrine) should flow.&amp;rdquo; – Wayne Stiles&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Psa 26:5 I hate the assembly of evildoers, and I will not sit with the wicked&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two critical questions we must ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who were the Nicolaitans?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we know we are NOT Nicolaitans?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 2:6 (Ephesus) and Revelation 2:14-15 (Pergamum) refer to the deeds and teaching of this group called the Nicolaitans. There&amp;rsquo;s an obvious question: &amp;ldquo;Who were the Nicolaitans?&amp;rdquo; We have no historical record of them before the Revelation. There is also a less obvious question: &amp;ldquo;How do I know I am not a Nicolaitan?&amp;rdquo; Without knowing their deeds and teachings, we could unknowingly be doing and teaching the same things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that anyone could make up anything they wanted to define who the Nicolaitans were after the fact. Here&amp;rsquo;s a hypothetical illustration. Suppose no one had ever heard the term &amp;ldquo;bear left&amp;rdquo; when suddenly it appeared in a set of directions. We could imagine a son asking his father, &amp;ldquo;Dad, what does &amp;lsquo;bear left&amp;rsquo; mean?&amp;rdquo; The answer could be, &amp;ldquo;well son, one time a bear was chasing a man, and he veered slightly to the left. The bear didn&amp;rsquo;t follow, and the man made it to safety. That&amp;rsquo;s what the term bear left means.&amp;rdquo; Of course, that answer is absurd. Just because words sound the same doesn&amp;rsquo;t automatically mean they&amp;rsquo;re linguistically connected (and the root word for bearing or heading has zero connection to the carnivorous mammal). But that&amp;rsquo;s basically what we are left with when trying to figure out who the Nicolaitans were. Scholars assume the definition is contained within the word &amp;ldquo;Nicolaitans&amp;rdquo;; they just aren&amp;rsquo;t sure what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, we know we must limit our conjectures to things that would have made sense to the original audience. While we don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly, we can make an educated guess about the nature of their deeds. The letter to Ephesus gives us no additional information but based on Revelation 2:14, Jesus speaks of the Nicolaitans in the context of sexual and dietary misconduct. For this, we need to dive into Acts 15 for some background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-acts-15-decision&#34;&gt;The Acts 15 Decision&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more Gentiles wanted to join the Jewish sect of the Nazarenes, a division arose among the Jewish leadership. Were these Gentiles going to be required to do a complete conversion to Judaism? In many respects, requiring conversion made sense. Ours is a Jewish sect with a Jewish Rabbi Jewish apostles, worshiping in Jewish synagogues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter, among others, made an impassioned plea that Judaism is a discipline as much as it is a religion or ethnicity. The sages speak of taking on the &amp;ldquo;yoke of the Torah.&amp;rdquo; We see this reference in Acts 15:10. The picture shows a plow where a pair of oxen would be yoked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we grow, we can take on more of that yoke. However, just as one would not attach a heavy load to a baby ox, Peter said we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t put the total weight of the Torah on a new adult gentile believer. The early church fathers agreed that Gentile converts to Judaism would be welcomed, but immediate conversion (signified by circumcision for males) was not required. In other words, Gentile believers were not required to take on the entire &amp;ldquo;yoke.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this said, new believers were to set themselves apart from pagans in four critical areas. These are recorded in Acts 15:28-29:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements: (29) that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these deals with feeding our flesh. The first three pertain to guardrails around the food they ate, and the last one has to do with keeping sexually pure. As we progress through the seven letters, we will see that these two categories are recurring concerns of Jesus (as we see in Rev 2:14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is evidence that these four stipulations were only intended as a starting point. A late 1st-century document called the &lt;em&gt;Didache&lt;/em&gt; appears to be a manual written by the Apostles with further instructions for growing Gentile talmidim, who were be expected to grow in maturity and gradually adopt additional Torah requirements. They did this not as a legalistic &amp;ldquo;got to&amp;rdquo; but as a grateful &amp;ldquo;get to.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind the list of restrictions mentioned in Acts is not a complete set of prohibitions. Were they allowed to steal and murder? Of course not. These four sins were specific challenges to new gentile followers of the Jewish messiah living in a Roman world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also need to discuss some background on &amp;ldquo;food&amp;rdquo; versus &amp;ldquo;not food&amp;rdquo; in the Jewish mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today most gentiles have categories: &amp;ldquo;food&amp;rdquo; is anything we desire to eat, and &amp;ldquo;not food&amp;rdquo; is everything else. Note the individual determines what food is and what is not, not God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Leviticus 11, Observant Jews have three categories, and it is God who determines which is in which type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Unclean Animals = Not food: this includes pork, anything that is a scavenger, and sea creatures without fins and scales. Items in category 1 are not &amp;ldquo;unclean food.&amp;rdquo; They are not food at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Food: vegetation, beef, and other land mammals meeting the requirements, fish, and fowl (unless otherwise excluded)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Unclean Food: the items in category #2, killed or prepared improperly, such as being strangled or found already dead (Lev 22:8), still containing lifeblood (Lev 7:26), or sacrificed to idols (Num 25:2-3). Also, fruit from a tree planted within three years is unclean and not to be eaten (Lev 11:34)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while they did not put the whole yoke of the Torah on new Gentile believers, it does appear they imposed the total weight as it pertains to dietary restrictions and sexual boundaries. Scholars debate this, but it becomes challenging to read Acts 15 any other way (don&amp;rsquo;t take my word for it; do your own research). You must think Jewish. Would it have made sense for a group of observant Jews to say it is OK to eat pork that was not dedicated to an idol, but it is not OK for them to eat the lamb that was so dedicated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to cloud the matter further, but the biblical dietary laws are not exactly the same as &amp;ldquo;keeping Kosher&amp;rdquo; as it&amp;rsquo;s practiced today. Modern rabbis have imposed many additional restrictions not directly in the Bible, such as it is forbidden to have dairy and meat in the same meal. There are no cheeseburgers at Kosher McDonalds in Israel. And there definitely are no bacon cheeseburgers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One additional nuance: Judaism was a recognized religion in the Roman empire, which means they were allowed to keep their dietary regulations. While most food sold in the market had been offered to one or more Roman gods, Jewish food was not. Lizorkin says, &amp;ldquo;Jews had their own slaughtering rules and privileges…food delivery and consumption did not follow the normal route of offerings to the Roman gods.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As mentioned in different contexts, Gentiles did not have this option. Almost everything they bought would have been offered to an idol. In other words, this requirement would have likely caused significant hardship on believing gentiles, but the Church required it because they were called to be separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul addresses many of these same challenges in his letters, particularly 1 Corinthians. Paul, who acknowledged that false gods were nothing, still sided with the Jerusalem council and forbade followers from eating food in any way associated with the Roman imperial cult (1 cor 8). If our view of Paul is that he came to set all rules aside, we may need to double-check our interpretation against Paul&amp;rsquo;s actual words recorded in Scripture. Again we see the importance of Acts 17:11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 15 also includes abstaining from sexual impropriety. Ephesus had a notorious brothel in addition to the male and female prostitutes at the temple of Diana. This picture is from a sidewalk in Ephesus. The heart shape on the upper left is filled with dots, interpreted as money being dropped into either a metaphorical heart or a literal purse. The left footprint is considered a directional indicator so that even the illiterate would know in which direction to go. A building interpreted as a brothel was found on the left side of this same block, in the foot&amp;rsquo;s direction. To the right of the footprint, there is also a drawing of a woman with a crown, usually taken as a representation of a prostitute. The followers of Jesus were to shun all immorality, which was prevalent in their day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food and sexual misconduct are two recurrent themes in the seven letters. These were also two items of Balaam&amp;rsquo;s treachery referenced in 2:14. As Lizorkin states, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to notice that out of four behaviors forbidden to Gentiles, two had to do with the Nicolaitans and the Balaam/Balak issues.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, let&amp;rsquo;s explore the three main conjectures present in most commentaries. According to each theory, their view is related to the supposed etymology of the word &amp;ldquo;Nicolaitans&amp;rdquo; and thus would have been understood by the original audience. Remember our &amp;ldquo;bear left&amp;rdquo; story above as we explore each of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;conjecture-1-an-early-type-of-clergy-that-ruled-the-people-laity-with-a-heavy-hand&#34;&gt;Conjecture #1: An early type of clergy that ruled the people (laity) with a heavy hand&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rationale: the word &amp;ldquo;Nicolaitans&amp;rdquo; comes from νικαω (to rule, conquer) and λαος (people, laity)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, even though the Apostles commissioned bishops, pastors, elders, and deacons, some in these offices let power go to their heads. On the surface, this seems plausible because we know how power can corrupt. Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;The servant is not greater than his lord.&amp;rdquo; John 13:16. Our Lord washed feet. Even his two great disciples, James and John, appeared to jockey for status by asking to sit at Jesus&amp;rsquo; right and left hands. So on the surface, this one sounds excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the more I study the context, the more I have trouble with this one. If this is supposedly leadership ruling over the laity, how is the Ephesian leadership in a position to resist this? In other words, a group wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to advance this position unless they were already in authority, which in Ephesus, the Nicolaitans clearly were not. How could the Pergamum assembly embrace it if they were subjected to inappropriate authority?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no historical basis for this position other than taking the words Nikao and Laos and putting them together. In some ways, it sounds like a contrived dig against the Catholic Church, which of course, would make it anachronistic. There is no way the audience could have foreseen a heavy-handed clergy restricting the rights of the laity when such behavior was probably at least 200 years in the future. While it&amp;rsquo;s true we&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed the bad fruit of such abuses of authority in recent years (and indeed abuses dating back to the middle ages), that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean these abuses were present in the 1st century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to the point, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit the context of the letter to Pergamum, which clearly deals with sexual and dietary misconduct. With that said, many people I greatly respect who are much smarter than I am, promote this view. So, we&amp;rsquo;ll hold in in our realm of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;conjecture-2-a-gnostic-cult-founded-by-nicholas-one-of-the-original-acts-65-deacons&#34;&gt;Conjecture #2: A Gnostic cult founded by Nicholas, one of the original Acts 6:5 deacons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rationale: the word &amp;ldquo;Nicolaitans&amp;rdquo; comes from νικολαον, &amp;ldquo;Nicholas&amp;rdquo; in reference to the deacon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view has historical evidence to support it (documented by Iraneus and others), but again it is documented after the fact so that it could be a &amp;ldquo;bear left&amp;rdquo; type of fable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Nicholas-followers believed all acts of the flesh (specifically sexual and likely dietary) were eternally meaningless. A core tenet of Gnosticism is that only the soul matters, so why not indulge in pleasures of the flesh? They held that Jesus was a spirit being who only appeared to be physical. For example, when he walked, he didn&amp;rsquo;t leave footprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view led to the gnostics ignoring Acts 15. If only the soul matters; they didn&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about physical restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that Gnostics were a heretical group and were a problem for the early church. Much of John&amp;rsquo;s epistles refute Gnosticism, and they are a strong candidate for the people for whom Jesus describes as &amp;ldquo;saying they are apostles but are not.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas Paul admonished us to keep the sinful flesh in check, Gnostics held that &amp;ldquo;anything goes&amp;rdquo; (yes, anything) because the flesh doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. As a result, they lived with unrestrained indulgence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One version has Nicholas himself (interestingly the only Gentile among the seven deacons) teaching strange ways. Another variant of the story is that Nicholas reportedly chose to live a celibate life after his conversion. One slight problem: he was already married. He decided to divorce his wife so that she would be free to marry another. At his divorce, he reportedly said, &amp;ldquo;anyone who desires her may have her.&amp;rdquo; According to Lancaster, this is a relatively standard Jewish language for divorcing his wife to allow her to remarry.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So he what he thought was right but didn&amp;rsquo;t set out to start a heretical sect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, Gnostics, who did not know the Jewish context for the quote and were infamous for twisting words, did exactly that. In their view, the quote was, &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;everyone&lt;/strong&gt; who desires her may have her.&amp;rdquo; The Nicolaitans, these Nicholas-followers, were permissive in all things, notably sexual impropriety, even though they professed faith in Jesus as their savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, the story reads like it is contrived. It&amp;rsquo;s as if someone said, &amp;ldquo;The Gnostics are bad. Let me tell you how bad they are…&amp;rdquo; and then made up this story about Nicholas to connect the evil Gnostics to the mysterious Nicolaitans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, this is probably the leading candidate from a 1st-century context perspective. But there is one other that is intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;conjecture-3-a-heretical-sect-that-claimed-the-jewish-dietary-laws-were-done-away-with&#34;&gt;Conjecture #3: A heretical sect that claimed the Jewish dietary laws were done away with&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rationale: Nicolaitans νικολαιτων is a &amp;ldquo;Hebraism&amp;rdquo;: a transliteration of the Hebrew word &amp;ldquo;נֹאכֵל&amp;rdquo; (nochel - let us/we will eat!) made into a plural noun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, this was the &amp;ldquo;we will eat anything&amp;rdquo; sect. According to Lizorkin, the earliest mention of this theory is John Lightfoot (mid-1600&amp;rsquo;s). Still, Lizorkin claims, the view is &amp;ldquo;is consistent with Revelation as a Jewish, anti-Roman document&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and &amp;ldquo;would make a strong connection in the context of Balaam and Balak.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this view, these &amp;ldquo;nochelaitans&amp;rdquo; possibly said something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;we have freedom in Christ, don&amp;rsquo;t we? Therefore, we can eat whatever we want, and God will bless us.&amp;rdquo; They were the &amp;ldquo;we will eat&amp;rdquo; people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Numbers, Balaam and Balak ensnared Israel by sexual sin and a banquet of idolatry. The Israelites, believers in Israel&amp;rsquo;s God, somehow rationalized that it was ok to partake. In so doing, the Israelites brought God&amp;rsquo;s judgment upon themselves. Jesus says that whoever the Nicolaitans are, they are doing and teaching the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus mentions food several times and is specifically concerned about eating food sacrificed to idols. In the promise to the Ephesians, those who overcome will be allowed to eat from the tree of life (we can read that as PROPER food). The Ballam and Balak incident is about feasting on forbidden idol food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While, in some respects, this sounds like a &amp;ldquo;bear left&amp;rdquo; made-up story, Lizorkin believes this view &amp;ldquo;makes more sense in the natural Jewish context&amp;rdquo; (than the other presumed definitions of Nicolaitans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, all three conjectures are educated guesses. Ultimately, we can&amp;rsquo;t prove who the Nicolaitans were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;nicolaitans-summary&#34;&gt;Nicolaitans summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three conjectures for the Nicolaitans share a common theme: they were a group of people who said, &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;re doing it our way,&amp;rdquo; despite what the Bible says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember the second question we asked at the beginning of this discussion? &amp;ldquo;How do we know we are not Nicolaitans?&amp;rdquo; The Nicolaitans were professing believers that had intentionally or unintentionally gotten off track. Maybe a third question we could ask is, &amp;ldquo;Did the Nicolaitans know Jesus hated their deeds before hearing John&amp;rsquo;s letter to Ephesus?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to think they were surprised. Most cult members sincerely believe in their cult&amp;rsquo;s teachings. One can be sincere in his beliefs and still be very wrong. This means that unknowingly there could be Nicolaitans (at least in the broad sense of Jesus hating their deeds) among us. Indeed, if we have strayed, ever so slightly from Jesus&#39; teachings, WE could also be doing the deeds of the Nicolaitans. Often a cult starts by taking a truth and overemphasizing it to the point of error. For example, many Christians today say, &amp;ldquo;I can do anything because Paul said, &amp;lsquo;all things are lawful.&#39;&amp;rdquo; The problem with this view is that it is out of context. In 1 Corinthians 6:12, Paul is quoting an argument of his opponents. Most assuredly, all things are NOT lawful for believers. The Bible calls us to be set apart from the world around us. Society is, of course, trying to tell the church that all kinds of sexual behavior (heterosexual promiscuity and otherwise) should be tolerated. Still, the Bible tells us to be set apart from the world around us, and that marriage is between one man and one woman forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many conservative Christians know that sexual sin is terrible, but we don&amp;rsquo;t think about what we eat. Perhaps the matter is not as cut and dry as we may think. Jesus links food and sexual appetites. We are supposed to be called out from non-believers and, according to the apostles, our diet is one way we do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a question to see whether there are traces of Nicolaitanism in us: if God gave us a command, but He didn&amp;rsquo;t provide what we thought was a &amp;ldquo;good reason,&amp;rdquo; what would we do? Would we obey as an act of devotion, or would we insist on doing it our way? Doing it our way is the teaching of the Nicolaitans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard a story of a Jew who said something to the effect of &amp;ldquo;Lord, if it were up to me, I would eat the delicious pig. But because you prohibit it, I will honor you and not eat the delicious pig.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may wonder why Jesus would care what we do, provided we believe in our hearts. I can&amp;rsquo;t speak for Jesus&amp;rsquo; reasons, but I only know that He does care. In some sense, everyone He chastises in these letters presumably had their &amp;ldquo;hearts in the right place.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our question is, &amp;ldquo;how will I choose to serve Him today?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;hate-the-sin-love-the-sinner&#34;&gt;Hate the sin; love the sinner.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note how Jesus says, &amp;ldquo;you hate what they do,&amp;rdquo; not &amp;ldquo;you hate the Nicolaitans as people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to get that backward – we hate the person but wink at the sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-27-promise-to-the-overcomer--ears&#34;&gt;Rev 2:7: Promise to the Overcomer / Ears&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(7) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.  To him winning the victory (or &amp;ldquo;him who overcomes&amp;rdquo;), I will give the right to eat from the Tree of Life which is in God&amp;rsquo;s Gan-`Eden.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 3:22-24 Then the LORD God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever—” 23 therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken. 24 He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life. Is 51:3 For the LORD comforts Zion; he comforts all her waste places and makes her wilderness like Eden, her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness will be found in her, thanksgiving and the voice of song.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;he-who-has-an-ear&#34;&gt;He who has an ear&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase can be said to be Jesus&#39; signature line; it frequently appears in the Gospels and each of the seven letters. Recall what we discussed in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://talmidimway.org/commentary/revelation/2-greetings-rev-1-1-11/#rev-13-the-blessing&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;previous lesson about the Hebrew word שָׁמַע (shama),&lt;/a&gt; which implies putting what we hear into action, versus passively listening. Baruch says that this phrase means the messages are directed to the saved.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:21&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-overcomers&#34;&gt;The overcomers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each letter, there will be a promise made to overcomers, or as Paul might say, those who finish the race well. In the last four letters, the promise comes before &amp;ldquo;He who has an ear,&amp;rdquo; whereas the promise comes after in the first three. We aren&amp;rsquo;t told the reason for this inversion, but it is conspicuous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;tree-of-life&#34;&gt;Tree of life&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first mention of the Tree of Life is in Genesis 2:9. &amp;ldquo;The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.&amp;rdquo; Eve then Adam ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and their eyes were opened to sin. God intervened before they could eat from the Tree of Life. Otherwise, they would have lived for eternity in their sinful state. As we see in the verses above, God drove them out of Eden and then blocked the way back. Now fast-forward to the end of the story, and Jesus is ready to open that way back up again; however, we do not want to eat of the tree until our sin state has been fully addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned above, Jesus is apparently stating that there will be a group of people who think they are believers who do not ultimately eat of the Tree of Life. See Matthew 7:21-22 and Luke 6:46. Whether these people lost their salvation or were never really saved is immaterial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is supremely material is that 21st-century believers follow Jesus&#39; instructions and make sure we are in the &amp;ldquo;overcomer&amp;rdquo; category. Our behavior matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, just as there are other Flood accounts, several different cultures, including the Babylonians, Assyrians, Hindus, Arabs, and Greeks have the equivalent of the Tree of Life in their legends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating implies fellowship. Beyond nourishment, the one who overcomes gets to fellowship with Yeshua and share in the Eternal Order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One central theme of the letters is not one of the assemblies viewed itself the way Jesus viewed it. The Ephesians believed that right beliefs and solid doctrine were all that was expected. Jesus demands our affection.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:22&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are the tie-ins to the conjectures mentioned in Lesson 5. Remember these are parallels in a broad sense and we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t hold too tightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name meaning: desired (one) or darling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Church age theory: Apostolic church (70-170)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pauline counterpart theory:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ephesians&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example: Eph 4:14 so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kingdom Parable theory: Four soils – Matthew 13:3-9; 18-23&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 13:3-9 He told them many things in parables: &amp;ldquo;A farmer went out to sow his seed. (4) As he sowed, some seed fell alongside the path; and the birds came and ate it up. (5) Other seed fell on rocky patches where there was not much soil. It sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow; (6) but when the sun had risen, the young plants were scorched; and since their roots were not deep, they dried up. (7) Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. (8) But others fell into rich soil and produced grain, a hundred or sixty or thirty times as much as had been sown. (9) Those who have ears, let them hear!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 13:18-23 &amp;ldquo;So listen to what the parable of the sower means. (19) Whoever hears the message about the Kingdom, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand it, is like the seed sown along the path—the Evil One comes and seizes what was sown in his heart. (20) The seed sown on rocky ground is like a person who hears the message and accepts it with joy at once, (21) but has no root in himself. So he stays on for a while; but as soon as some trouble or persecution arises on account of the message, he immediately falls away. (22) Now the seed sown among thorns stands for someone who hears the message, but it is choked by the worries of the world and the deceitful glamor of wealth, so that it produces nothing. (23) However, what was sown on rich soil is the one who hears the message and understands it; such a person will surely bear fruit, a hundred or sixty or thirty times what was sown.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time, we will look at Smyrna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Smyrna, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the First and the Last, who died and came alive again: (9) &amp;ldquo;I know how you are suffering and how poor you are (though in fact you are rich!), and I know the insults of those who call themselves Jews but aren&amp;rsquo;t—on the contrary, they are a synagogue of the Adversary. (10) Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid of what you are about to suffer. Look, the Adversary is going to have some of you thrown in prison, in order to put you to the test; and you will face an ordeal for ten days. Remain faithful, even to the point of death; and I will give you life as your crown. (11) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities. He who wins the victory will not be hurt at all by the second death.&amp;rdquo; &#39;&lt;/td&gt;

This resulted in economic prosperity, though Smyrna was never as commercially significant as Ephesus. The map below shows Smyrna&amp;rsquo;s location respective to Ephesus and Pergamum. It&amp;rsquo;s about 42 miles north of Ephesus. Like Ephesus, the harbor eventually became silted over and the modern shoreline is a few miles to the west.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Ephesus, which tended to pick the wrong side during the great imperial battles of antiquity, Smyrna did not. In fact, they were steadfastly loyal to Rome. This was true long before Rome came to power. They built a temple to Roma, the deified personification of Rome in 195 BCE, when Smyrna was in Greek hands.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strabo, the great geographer of antiquity, indicated that the ancient Smyrnans believed their city to be the birthplace of Homer and had what they called a Homerium: a temple to Homer and a statue. Strabo also said that Smyrna was &amp;ldquo;the most beautiful city in Ionia.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern Turkish city of Izmir sits atop where we believe ancient Smyrna is. This has significantly limited archaeological excavation. Because of this, we are unable to confirm any Jewish/Christian presence in the city at the time Revelation was written. However as scholars will point out, &amp;ldquo;absence of evidence, is not evidence of absence.&amp;rdquo; Bolen points out the modern city of Izmir, &amp;ldquo;has a long history of Jewish residents, evidenced by the number of synagogues in the area of the historic city…at one time there were nine synagogues located on a single street.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of all the seven cities mentioned in Revelation, only Smyrna (Izmir) survives as a continuously inhabited city.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-roman-imperial-cult&#34;&gt;The Roman Imperial Cult&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Ephesus, the culture of Smyrna was deeply seated in the worship of what is called the Roman Imperial Cult. They were described as &amp;ldquo;being loyal to Rome and its gods, even unto death.&amp;rdquo; This is one of those likely local allusions (or maybe a better word is a &amp;lsquo;pun&amp;rsquo;) Jesus makes in Rev 2:10, when He says, &amp;ldquo;Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/0328930d97a78c3b85e84522af8a2260.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;30%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;We see an example of this in an inscription to Hadrian found at Smyrna. The dedication describes Hadrian as &amp;ldquo;Olympian, Savior, and Founder.&amp;rdquo; (Ὀλυμπίωι σωτῆρι καὶ κτίστηι).&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; By calling him &amp;ldquo;Olympian,&amp;rdquo; they are saying Hadrian is equivalent to Zeus. It is no accident that they used words challenging the status of Jesus as Savior. Even though Hadrian would have been after the time John wrote (this dedication dates to 128 CE), this is still illustrative of the culture the believers in Smyrna found themselves. Even though after the fact, labeling Hadrian as &amp;ldquo;founder&amp;rdquo; is in opposition to Jesus calling Himself &amp;ldquo;the First and the Last.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emperor worship was mandatory. The law required citizens to make an annual offering and acknowledge publicly that Caesar was supreme lord. They received a certificate that they had done so, after which they were permitted to worship whatever gods they wanted. As we have noted, ethnic Jews were in a protected class and exempted from this by law, but gentile believers were not. This led to significant tensions between Jews (both believing and non-believing) and Gentile followers of Yeshua, the Jewish Messiah, with the former group being called to publicly denounce the latter. The lack of &amp;ldquo;proper papers&amp;rdquo; showing this group refused to worship Caesar added to the pressure believers and those protecting them were under (remember in Nazi Germany, those who aided and abetted Jews were sent to camps or killed on the spot the same as the Jews they helped).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in Ephesus, there was a large area called an Agora that served as a civic forum and also had areas for shopping. All of this was under the watchful eye of altars to Zeus, Poseidon, Demeter, and Artemis. It appears that Cybele, the Phrygian mother goddess, was the patron goddess of Smyrna. According to legend, Cybele is the mother of Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. Numerous coins minted in Smyrna bear her image.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Today, we can see many arches that were built to support the Agora following the earthquake in 178 AD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another possible allusion in the letter occurs when Jesus refers to Himself as the one &amp;ldquo;who died and came to life.&amp;rdquo; Smyrna was destroyed and rebuilt multiple times, often by an earthquake. In addition to the quake in 178 CE, A significant temblor in 179 BCE destroyed much of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;new-testament-smyrna&#34;&gt;New Testament Smyrna&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Rev 2:8 is the only mention of Smyrna in the Bible, we believe Paul traveled to Troas passing through Smyrna and Pergamum, on his way to Greece as recorded in Acts 20. Paul also spent more than two years in Ephesus, so he could have made a trip to Smyrna. Acts 19:10 states, &amp;quot; This continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of the Bible, Smyrna is best known in Christian circles as the town where Polycarp was martyred. Polycarp was a disciple of John the Apostle and was the Bishop of Smyrna&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. A later tradition has Polycarp being betrayed by non-believing Jews, but this appears to be an anti-Semitic addition in an anachronistic attempt to libel the Jews with additional crimes against Christians and force-fulfill the prophecy in Revelation 2 regarding the persecution of the Smyrnan believers. History shows this persecution was at the hands of the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest records indicate that Polycarp was brought before the provincial governor. DeSilva writes, &amp;ldquo;the governor might not have known about the Christian faith, but he knew that it drew people away from giving the gods their due.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For this reason, this sect of the Nazarenes was an existential threat to the Roman way of life and had to be dealt with, &amp;lsquo;east of all by &amp;ldquo;Rome&amp;rsquo;s oldest and most faithful of allies.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The martyrdom of Polycarp records the dialogue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City official: What harm is it to say, &amp;lsquo;Caesar is Lord&amp;rsquo; and to offer a sacrifice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polycarp: For eighty-six years I have served Him, and He has wronged me in no way. How then, can I revile my King, who rescued me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this refusal, Polycarp was then attempted to be burned at the stake. The story goes that, like Shadraq, Mishaq, and Abednego in the book of Daniel, the fires danced around Polycarp but did not harm. When fire failed to do the job, Polycarp was then stabbed to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story – how much of it is true we don&amp;rsquo;t know – illustrates Jesus&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;no compromise&amp;rdquo; position to his faithful. No matter how bad things get, &amp;ldquo;even to the point of death&amp;rdquo; we must never deny Him. Conversely, for Christians, we know the end of our lives in this world is not the end of the story. Along with the story of Polycarp, the letter to Smyrna serves as a reminder to keep the heavenly perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(8) &amp;ldquo;And to the angel of the (&lt;em&gt;ecclesia)&lt;/em&gt; Messianic Community in Smyrna, write: ‘The words of the first and the last, who died and came to life.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 41:4 Who has performed and done this, calling the generations from the beginning? I, the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he Isa 44:6 Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: “I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god &lt;br&gt;Isa 48:12 “Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel, whom I called! I am he; I am the first, and I am the last.  &lt;br&gt;Rev 22:13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”  &lt;br&gt;Mat 2:11 And going into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. &lt;br&gt;Mar 15:23 And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. &lt;br&gt;Joh 19:39 Nicodemus also, who earlier had come to Jesus by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds in weight. &lt;br&gt;Isa 60:6 A multitude of camels shall cover you, the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all those from Sheba shall come. They shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall bring good news, the praises of the LORD. &lt;em&gt;(note: no Myrrh)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;myrrh&#34;&gt;Myrrh&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/b13284f70d65fa882b0f9370c6ea72d5.jpg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;Smyrna meaning: related to Myrrh, which is often used as an embalming ointment. As you can see in the photo, it starts out as a resin but must be crushed to activate its full potential. Is there a lesson for us as believers given what we are about to read? Smyrna was one of the chief exporters of Myrrh to the ancient world. We mentioned in the Ephesus lesson how many of the goods listed in Revelation 18 would have passed through the ports of Western Turkey. Myrrh is specifically named in Rev 18:13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myrrh was one of the three gifts the Magi brought at Jesus&amp;rsquo; birth along with gold and frankincense (Mat 2:11). Scholars see these gifts as prophetically speaking of Jesus as King (gold), Priest (frankincense), and His death as a prophet (myrrh, as most biblical prophets died as martyrs). We see it mentioned twice at Jesus&#39; death. Once while He was on the cross (Mark 15:23, here used as an anesthetic) and another in John 19:39 when Nicodemus came to embalm Jesus after His death. Missler pointed out that in Isaiah 60:6, which describes the second coming, there will be gold and frankincense, but no Myrrh. His death is behind Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;description-of-messiah&#34;&gt;Description of Messiah&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The description of Messiah is taken from Rev 1:17-18: &amp;quot; “Don’t be afraid! I am the First and the Last, the Living One. I was dead, but look!—I am alive forever and ever!&amp;rdquo; The First and the Last is a frequent title of Adonai, whom we would call God the Father. It also occurs four times in Revelation, including twice with the addition &amp;ldquo;was dead and am alive.&amp;rdquo; This indicates that just as John 1:1 says &amp;ldquo;…and the word WAS God,&amp;rdquo; there is a blending of God the Father and God the Son. We have some other &amp;ldquo;First and the Last&amp;rdquo; references above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Jas 1:2-3 Regard it all as joy, my brothers, when you face various kinds of temptations; (3) for you know that the testing of your trust produces perseverance.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tribulation – θλιψιν (thliphsis)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/754c8fbe9bcebb37645299cdfe25539e.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;The root word for tribulation means simply &amp;ldquo;pressure&amp;rdquo;. It can be compared to the pressure used to extract juice from grapes or oil from olives. However, it does not necessarily have to denote physical persecution. As we mentioned above, believers in Smyrna clearly had to live their lives as a fringe group. They did not have religious protections like we do today (for now). They would have been ostracized, perhaps not able to hold jobs or purchase necessities, and likely were under constant threat of being arrested. Much of this would have been true for Jewish as well as Gentile believers in Messiah. Non-Jewish believers had the added pressure of being required to participate in the emperor-worship ceremony. Like Tom Bradford, a commentator, stated, &amp;ldquo;you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be beaten to feel beaten down.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being outside of the mainstream economy likely meant that many believers were materially poor. In fact, there are two Greek words for poverty: one means having nothing fancy, and the other means being destitute and reduced to begging. Jesus uses the second one, πτωχειαν ptocheia, here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus reminds them to have the heavenly view. From a kingdom perspective, they are rich. We&amp;rsquo;ve said before that a major theme of these letters is that the recipients didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily see themselves as Jesus sees them. This cuts both ways. Certainly, for the letters containing judgments, we can infer that this material deficiency in their faith that Jesus called out probably came as a surprise. In the same way, the believers of Smyrna thought they were poor, but they held the wrong perspective. We all need to have a kingdom perspective, no matter the circumstances of our earthly situation. Remember a simple motion of worshipping the emperor, which they could have faked, would have given them their papers and alleviated most of the suffering. Were some of them second-guessing that decision? Jesus affirms they made the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Antisemitic interpretations of 2:9&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I need to say how thankful I am for the work of Chuck Missler. While he wasn&amp;rsquo;t perfect in all his analyses (indeed none of us are), he took a firm stance against Replacement Rheology. In the early 90s, shortly after I came to faith, a co-worker told me I had to listen to Chuck. He was on the radio in Orange County every afternoon at 4. He labeled replacement theology what it was: a heresy that should have no place in our churches. Replacement Theology is the view that national Israel has been &amp;ldquo;replaced&amp;rdquo; by the church and that all the promises made to the nation, most of which were unconditional, have been forfeited. This view makes God a liar. This heresy took root early on and the church has had a long history of antisemitism. The atrocities against the Jews under the banner of &amp;ldquo;Christ&amp;rdquo; sicken the stomach. Honestly, if I were a traditional Jew and knew this history, I would want nothing to do with Christianity either. This has also been a tragedy for the church as we have disconnected ourselves from the Jewishness of our faith (last time I checked, our founder was an observant Jew!) and we have also discounted the value of the Old Testament, which is over 2/3 of God&amp;rsquo;s Word that we claim to hold as inerrant. The only bad thing about my being taught to avoid this from practically day 1 of my walk with Jesus is that I was thoroughly unprepared for how pervasive this view is in the church today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point in this preface is that if you come across a definition of &amp;ldquo;Jews who are not&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;synagogue of Satan&amp;rdquo; as referring to all non-believing Jews throughout history, you need to know this interpretation is from the enemy – even if the commentator is a believing Christian with the best of intentions. The term &amp;ldquo;synagogue of Satan&amp;rdquo; has become a favorite anti-semitic slur. None other than Billy Graham used this term as an anti-semitic racial slur in a recorded conversation with President Nixon in 1972.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lizorkin elaborates: &amp;ldquo;the standard interpretation forces the reader to use later anachronistic categories while reading first-century texts,&amp;rdquo; namely Christians reading Jewish persecution into the story of Polycarp (which itself happened many decades after the letter to Smyrna), when this version of the facts is dubious at best. &amp;ldquo;History helps, but only if it is contemporaneous to John&amp;rsquo;s words.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Lizorkin and other commentators have noted antisemitic bias on the part of bible translators. In James 2:2, the word sunagogeh is used but it is rarely if ever translated as synagogue. Translators prefer &amp;ldquo;assembly&amp;rdquo; when the word is neutral or positive. In other words, &lt;em&gt;sunagogeh&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ecclesia&lt;/em&gt; mean exactly the same thing. They are synonymns. However, when sunagogeh has a negative connotation as it does here in Rev 2:9, they choose &amp;ldquo;synagogue&amp;rdquo; as it brings to mind a uniquely Jewish affiliation. As we have pointed out, the early &amp;ldquo;Christians&amp;rdquo; met in synagogues through the early second century at the earliest, possibly even longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with all of this lengthy preface, let&amp;rsquo;s come up with a non Replacement Theology position on &amp;ldquo;those who call themselves Jews but aren&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Synagogue of Satan.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to avoid antisemitism with this verse? Absolutely. All we have to do is simply follow the primary rule of Bible interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary Rule of Bible Interpretation: When the plain sense of Scripture makes common sense, seek no other sense (or you&amp;rsquo;ll end up with a pretense that is likely nonsense).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, as Dr. Fructenbaum says, &amp;ldquo;we take every word at face value unless the facts or immediate context CLEARLY indicate otherwise. A literal interpretation does not rule out figures of speech but even these have a literal background.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This is a rule that if you ask every serious Bible commentator, they will agree with it. Yet MOST of these same commentators completely throw this out the window when it comes to prophesy in general, and these two verses regarding the Jews specifically. They will concoct some scheme that it is true Jews who are not are really Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the letter to Ephesus, we had a nearly identical phrase, &amp;ldquo;those who call themselves apostles (Christians) but are not.&amp;rdquo; In that case, the meaning was seemingly obvious. These people are imposters. They claim to be Christians, but their behavior tells a different story. They are Christians in name only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the only question to ask is &amp;ldquo;what is the plain sense reading of &amp;lsquo;those who call themselves Jews but aren&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rdquo;? Answer: these are people who are NOT Jews. They are imposters, being dishonest about their affiliation. They claim to be Jews, but their behavior tells a different story. They are Jews in name only. And in this case, this group of imposters is slandering the believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was that so hard? I am baffled why commentators go to great lengths to allegorize this passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, do we already have an example &lt;em&gt;from scripture,&lt;/em&gt; of such a group of people calling themselves Jews but not acting like Jews? As a matter of fact, yes. John 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joh 8:39-44 They answered him, “Abraham is our father.” Jesus said to them, “If you were Abraham&amp;rsquo;s children, you would be doing the works Abraham did, (40) but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did. (41) You are doing the works your father did.” They said to him, “We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father—even God.” (42) Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but he sent me. (43) Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word. (44) You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father&amp;rsquo;s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we discussed in Gospel Backgrounds, Jesus is not speaking to or about all Jews in John 8. He is not even speaking to all Pharisees. He is speaking to a narrow subset of Pharisees who were involved in a plot to kill him. We can prove that not all Pharisees are implicated because there were several Pharisees who believed in Jesus - namely Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea. As an aside, there is some historical reason to believe that Jesus might not have been speaking to any Pharisees here, but general members of the Jerusalem corrupt temple establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Jews were not responsible for His crucifixion. It occurred very early in the morning on a feast day. The vast majority of Jews were at home, probably sleeping. No, this was a sly crime at the hands of very few, probably much fewer than we may realize. Tens of thousands of Jews came to faith after the Resurrection and thousands of Jews are coming to faith in Yeshua as their messiah today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it is wholly incorrect to say that the Jews who are not, refers to all Jews throughout history. We know that Rev 2:2 is not speaking about all Christians. Just as there are corrupt Christians whom we might call Christians in Name only, there were and are corrupt Jews who are &amp;ldquo;Jews in name only&amp;rdquo; but who really have Satan, the accuser as their father. Therefore, Jesus is basically saying that their father is not Abraham but Satan, and they don&amp;rsquo;t worship in a proper synagogue, but a Synagogue devoted to their father. Not necessarily one filled with satanic rituals as we might think of them, but one built on accusations, such as informing against one&amp;rsquo;s brethren to the authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Lancaster, informing and accusing one&amp;rsquo;s neighbor is expressly prohibited by the Torah. Jews who were doing this were behaving exactly like the Jews Jesus was contesting in John 8. They were not upholding the high ethical standards God expects of His followers.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Leviticus 19:18 says to love your neighbor as yourself. While Jews debated as to who their neighbor was (see the Good Samaritan parable), unquestionably fellow Jews and gentiles who worshipped alongside each other in Synagogue would have been their neighbor whom they were to love, not accuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other views that are equally plausible. Lizorkin sees fake converts trying to avoid persecution.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This view fits given Jesus&amp;rsquo; command to hold fast. This group caved and perhaps renounced Jesus, if only for show. Fructenbaum sees Rome and their anti-Messiah emperor as impersonating the one true God and His Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is not correct is to affix this label to those who really are Jewish and have done nothing to disavow that status. Also keep in mind that as of this letter, there was no separate Gentile Christian religion separate from Judaism. Jesus and Paul both make it clear that the Kingdom is for the Jew first. We gentiles are included only by God&amp;rsquo;s grace. Paul even warns us not to become proud (and our inclusion is supposed to provoke them to jealousy, not make them want to have nothing to do with us!). I encourage a careful study of Romans 9-11.&lt;/p&gt;

will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;judgment-but-i-have-this-against-you-omitted-for-smyrna&#34;&gt;Judgment &amp;ldquo;But I have this against you&amp;rdquo;: OMITTED FOR SMYRNA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our lesson on the sevenfold structure, we mentioned that the standard outline for these letters has seven elements including a section on Judgment. That is the rule, but there are two exceptions. Smyrna is one of the two cities that receives no Judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep this in mind whenever we are going through a trial. We often feel as if God has abandoned us and maybe feel that we must have done something for God to judge us by sending us this trial. The letter to Smyrna corrects that thinking. Just because there is tribulation doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that it is God&amp;rsquo;s judgment. In Smyrna&amp;rsquo;s case it clearly was not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Lizorkin points out, the concept of things not truly being as they appear is a trademark of apocalyptic literature.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As we mentioned in the early lessons, a reason for God giving a revelation was to communicate that even though things seem bad on earth, God is still in control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(10) Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid of what you are about to suffer. Look, the Adversary is going to have some of you thrown in prison, in order to put you to the test; and you will face an ordeal for ten days. Remain faithful, even to the point of death; and I will give you life as your crown.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fear not&amp;rdquo; ~150x 2Ti 3:12 And indeed, all who want to live a godly life united with the Messiah Yeshua will be persecuted,   Jas 1:2-3 Regard it all as joy, my brothers, when you face various kinds of temptations; (3) for you know that the testing of your trust produces perseverance.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not fear is a major theme of Revelation. Even though things are bad, do not fear. In fact, things are going to get worse. Even though you may be unjustly thrown in jail, do not fear. Even though you may die, do not fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus reminds them that it is Satan, the accuser or the adversary who is behind all of this. We only see earthly combatants, but God shows us there is a much bigger picture spiritually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars don&amp;rsquo;t know what the &amp;ldquo;ten days&amp;rdquo; means. If we take it literally, there could have been a period of ten days where there was a wave of intense persecution. This would be something like a pogrom.  Others, particularly those who hold to the Church Age theory, see ten Roman Emperors who specifically persecuted believers.  See callout below for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;10 Roman Emperors?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proponents of the church-age theory see a list of ten Roman emperors between 50-311 who persecuted the church&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;54-68 Nero (Paul and Peter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;95-96 Domitian (John (attempted, then exiled))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;104-117 Trajan ( Ignatius)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;161-180 Marcus Aurelius (Polycarp)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200-211 Septimus Severus (Iraneus)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;235-237 Maximinus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;249-251 Decius&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;257-260 Valerian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;270-275 Aurelian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;303-311 Diocletian (worst of all!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Foxe&amp;rsquo;s book of Martyrs, it is reported that 5 million believers died for Christ during this period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The priests of the various deities in Smyrna wore a laurel (crown of leaves) in honor of their service. Jesus says His faithful will receive a crown in honor of their service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(11) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities. He who wins the victory will not be hurt at all by the second death.&amp;rdquo; &#39;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev_20:6 Blessed and holy &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years. Rev_20:14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. Rev 21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will find out more about the second death once we get to Revelation 20. There is a quip attributed to DL Moody, &amp;ldquo;born twice, die once; born once, die twice.&amp;rdquo; Born-again believers are spared the second death, while the unrepentant are not born again get to die once on this earth and then will be cast into the second death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we move on to our three speculation areas: the church age theory, the Pauline letter tie in and the parable tie in. Proponents of the church age theory see Smyrna as representative of the Persecuted church from 170 to 312, as exemplified by the 10 Roman emperors with state sponsored persecution we listed earlier. This all came to an end with the edict of Toleration (Christianity decriminalized if we want to look at it that way) around 311 between Emperors Galerius and Constantine (yes there were two. There were actually three). The full legalization of Christianity occurred in 313, but that ushered in a whole new set of problems which we&amp;rsquo;ll get to when we look at the church of Pergamum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;25 but while people were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, then went away.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;26 When the wheat sprouted and formed heads of grain, the weeds also appeared.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;27 The owner&amp;rsquo;s servants came to him and said, &amp;lsquo;Sir didn&amp;rsquo;t you sow good seed in your field? Where have the weeds come from?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;28 He answered, &amp;lsquo;An enemy has done this.&amp;rsquo; The servants asked him, &amp;lsquo;Then do you want us to go and pull them up?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;29 But he said, &amp;lsquo;No, because if you pull up the weeds, you might uproot some of the wheat at the same time.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;30 Let them both grow together until the harvest; and at harvest-time I will tell the reapers to collect the weeds first and tie them in bundles to be burned, but to gather the wheat into my barn.&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1:14 And most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1:18-21 What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice, (19) for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, (20) as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. (21) For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1:27-28 Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel, (28) and not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1:29 For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;2:2 complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;2:3-4 Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. (4) Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. (speaks to the importance of being who you say you are – if say we follow God, we need to act like it).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;2:7-8 but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. (8) And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;2:15-16 that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, (16) holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. (and get your crown!)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;2:17 Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;3:7 But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;3:10-11 that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, (11) that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;3:14 I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;3:20-21 But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, (21) who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;4:4-8 Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice. (5) Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand; (6) do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. (7) And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. (8) Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Pergamum, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the one who has the sharp double-edged sword: (13) &amp;ldquo;I know where you are living, there where the Adversary&amp;rsquo;s throne is. Yet you are holding onto my name. You did not deny trusting me even at the time when my faithful witness Antipas was put to death in your town, there where the Adversary lives. (14) Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: you have some people who hold to the teaching of Bil`am, who taught Balak to set a trap for the people of Isra&amp;rsquo;el, so that they would eat food that had been sacrificed to idols and commit sexual sin. (15) Likewise, you too have people who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans. (16) Therefore, turn from these sins. Otherwise, I will come to you very soon and make war against them with the sword of my mouth. (17) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities. To him winning the victory, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give him a white stone, on which is written a new name that nobody knows except the one receiving it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pergamum (aka, Pergamon or Pergamos) is inland about 70 miles north of Smyrna. Archaeologists believe the city was founded in the third millennium BCE. The town likely owes its beginnings to geography, as there is a conspicuous hill 900 feet above the valley below. It was once thought to be impregnable. Later, Lysimachus, one of Alexander the Great&amp;rsquo;s four succeeding generals, built a military fortification on this hill called an acropolis. Lysimachus also built Ephesus, and the two cities would vie for power and favor throughout the Roman period. Ultimately Ephesus, with its harbor, became the economic power, while Pergamum became the religious center. Since religion and politics were one and the same, Pergamum became the Roman capital of Asia minor.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The second photo shows a closer look at the acropolis with labels from Dr. Bolen. Note the theater with seating for 10,000 built into the hill. It is the steepest of all Roman theaters excavated in Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The library was massive by standards of the day with 200,000 volumes, barely second to the library at Alexandria, Egypt. Stiles notes that after relations with the Romans and Egyptians soured and the empire no longer had access to papyrus, Pergamum&amp;rsquo;s people developed parchment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;emperor-worshiproman-imperial-cult&#34;&gt;Emperor Worship/Roman Imperial Cult&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/468f7c93bbb74a67b807c9a9cf792d4e.png&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 250 BCE, Bolen writes, &amp;ldquo;Pergamum became a leading cultural center, especially in art and science. The acropolis underwent a massive restoration, and the Aesculapian was founded.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Missler writes that Pergamum &amp;ldquo;became the center of the official religion of emperor worship. The first temple of this cult was erected at Pergamos in 27 BCE.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In his commentary, Missler also traces several pagan myths founded in Babylon that eventually were incorporated at Pergamum during the Greek period and eventually to Rome during the Roman period. As was common to all seven cities, numerous pagan statues, shrines, and temples were built in homage to the Roman Imperial Cult. It is also depicted on their coinage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/b43ad60e966f33f3df7bb0b269ade942.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt; As discussed previously, this put the gentile believers in a difficult position. Emperor worship was compulsory unless you were Jewish. Although not explicitly stated, we can speculate that many in Pergamum went through the motions of the emperor worship procedures (compared to Smyrna, where they did not). Jewish believers and nonbelievers were still in an uncomfortable position, of course. The Torah prohibits graven images, such as the one on this coin and the many statutes erected around the town. Many probably simply got used to it; in other words, they compromised. The genuinely devout would have continued to be bothered by it. As we discussed in the Smyrna lesson, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be beaten to feel beaten down. DeSilva notes, &amp;ldquo;Antagonism towards the Christian movement appears to have been particularly high (in Pergamum), resulting in the murder (whether as a result of official proceedings or back-alley action) of a Christian named Antipas.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This was life for the believers in the Roman empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener also notes that local rulers were first worshipped and revered in Pergamum, and emperor worship is reflected on coins. &amp;ldquo;Pergamum was one of the first cities of Asia to build a temple to a Roman emperor, making it a center of the cult.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; DeSilva notes that &amp;ldquo;the temple of Roma and Augustus in Pergamum is a manifestation of the cult of the beast and its image.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In any case, we can infer that Pergamum was exceedingly wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;altar-to-zeus&#34;&gt;Altar to Zeus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/f7f18007082f93aa77df3052250281ce.png&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeus (or Jupiter to the Romans) is believed to be the chief of the Greek gods. In Pergamum, there was a massive temple to Zeus. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In a 1st century Jewish mindset, he would be the chief of the false gods, making him equivalent to Satan. Where there is a temple to a god is where his throne is. This leads many to conclude Zeus&amp;rsquo; temple is &amp;ldquo;where Satan has his throne.&amp;rdquo; The altar is in Berlin today; although it is commonly believed that Hitler had it moved, Bolen notes that it was moved in the 19th century.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Today all that remains in Pergamum are stairs and the altar&amp;rsquo;s foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aesculapius was a god who had healing and resurrection powers by using the blood of Medusa. The latter is how he came to be associated with snakes. Note the counterfeit themes of healing, resurrection, and blood. Aesculapius is almost always portrayed with a snake, Propylon, who gave him healing powers.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  As an aside, Asclepius had two noteworthy daughters, Hygia and Panacea, where we get our words hygiene and panacea today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also see the serpent imagery proudly displayed on this coin from Pergamum. As we&amp;rsquo;ve said before, we need to put ourselves in the shoes of those believers living in that time and realize how difficult life was to be a pure and undefiled believer in Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early medicine was directly associated with serpent worship. It was more superstition than science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed is the serpent symbolism, such as the modern logo of the American Medical Association, the professional organization for physicians in the United States. Many health related agencies use the serpent on a pole symbolism.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;The original serpent on a pole: Numbers 21&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/9030f3e7d0839a48c6007c8b1f3eed4d.jpg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;The serpent on a pole is likely a corruption of Numbers 21. When the Israelites in the wilderness grumbled against God and Moses, they had a lack of faith and believed they were led out in the wilderness to die. We may not utter those words, but how often is our attitude precisely like this. God wants to build us, and that can be painful at times. He&amp;rsquo;s using that two-edged sword to excise tumors in our lives. In Israel&amp;rsquo;s case, the Lord sent fiery serpents, perhaps cobras, as a curse, and many died. Those who survived prayed for relief. Here God tells Moses to do something that admittedly is very odd. Num 21:8 And the LORD said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent (out of bronze) and set it on a pole, and everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.” Moses made the serpent out of brass. In Hebrew, there is a deliberate play on words as snake/serpent and brass are linguistically connected נְחַ֣שׁ נְחֹ֔שֶׁת. Brass is a symbol of judgment, and in this case, the snakes were a judgment. IN the Garden, the snake brought judgment. Interestingly, 700 or 800 years later, this pole is still around and yet has become an item of idolatry (idolatry is the very thing Jesus has most against the assembly at Pergamum). During his religious reforms, Judean King Hezekiah, one of the good kings who &amp;ldquo;did what was right in the eyes of the LORD…smashed the bronze serpent Moses had made, for until those days the people of Israel had made offerings to it (it was called Nehushtan).&amp;rdquo; (2 Kings 18:4) Walton notes, &amp;ldquo;Nehushtan appears to have been diety of healing.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is not too much of a stretch to see that what started as a legitimate symbol of God&amp;rsquo;s healing became paganized into Asclepius.&lt;/p&gt;

Archeologists have identified around 400 of these, but the largest was in Pergamum. The Asclepion in Pergamum was a large complex with healing chambers, sacred pools for mud baths, a medical library (using the phrase loosely), and a 3500-seat theater. It was believed that a combination of Aesculapius worship, sedative or hallucinogenic drug use, and snakes (sometimes snake bites) would bring about healing. It was something like an entertainment center, late 60&amp;rsquo;s Haight-Ashbury district, hospital, a pagan temple, and spa rolled into one. Emperor Hadrian was once a patient at the Asclepium in Pergamum. Lancaster reports that patients were given a drug, then they would enter the complex by way of an 86-yard dark tunnel where they would hear voices (actually priests standing above the tunnel), then he or she would lie in a bed, and snakes would slither over the patient and speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aesclepium in Pergamum was the most famous, but there were other such centers throughout the Greco-Roman world; archeologists have identified 400 Aesclepia. Biblical scholars and archeologists believe there was such a place in Jerusalem, called the Pools of Bethesda. John 5 takes on an entirely new level of understanding once we realize this was not a place where an angel of the Lord stirred the waters.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It was a pagan and demonic healing center where Jesus proved Himself greater. See our video from &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/G6XOcfHcchQ&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gospel Backgrounds #11&lt;/a&gt; for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given Satan&amp;rsquo;s association with the serpent from Genesis 3, the Asclepion is another strong candidate for &amp;ldquo;Satan&amp;rsquo;s throne,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;new-testament-pergamum&#34;&gt;New Testament Pergamum&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation contains the only two mentions of Pergamum in the New Testament.  After the apostolic period, Bolen notes intense persecution of Christians broke out under the rule of Decius (249-251), but the Edict of Milan in 313 declared Christianity legal, and by 379, &amp;ldquo;it had become the state religion; pagan temples were converted into churches.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the present city of Bergama lies near ancient Pergamum. Bergama has a population of around 20,000, compared to ten times that many in Roman times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Pergamum, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the one who has the sharp double-edged sword:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 1:16 In his right hand, he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in full strength.  &lt;br&gt;Joh 1:17 For (just as) the law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.  &lt;br&gt;Isa 11:4 but with righteousness, he shall judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth; and he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked.  &lt;br&gt;Isa 49:2 He made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand he hid me; he made me a polished arrow; in his quiver, he hid me away.  &lt;br&gt;2 Th 2:8 And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming. &lt;br&gt; 2 Ti 3:16-17 All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, (17) that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pergamum&lt;/strong&gt; meaning: directly it means height or elevation, which given the geography fits. Indirectly, it could be related to marriage (monogamy, polygamy). In medical terms, &lt;em&gt;per&lt;/em&gt; usually means through (percutaneous, through the cutaneous layer of the skin; perforate is to tear or make a hole through). In this sense while &amp;ldquo;through marriage&amp;rdquo; Pergamum could connote a &amp;ldquo;strange or abnormal marriage&amp;rdquo;, one that is penetrated or perforated inappropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/7f2c14d943c86419e27335e4e929d7e5.png&#34; width=&#34;30%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;A literal &lt;strong&gt;sword&lt;/strong&gt; is a weapon that can be used either offensively or defensively. It protects, separates, and, if necessary, kills. In antiquity and today with Islam, the sword is synonymous with the power to execute judgment, specifically capital punishment.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Therefore, Jesus&amp;rsquo; selection of the sword image could be related to the event He&amp;rsquo;s about to recount regarding Antipas&#39; capital punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The congregation in Pergamum was in a challenging location, where &lt;strong&gt;Satan dwells&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s no accident (and in the Bible, nothing is there by accident) that Jesus has the sharp two-edged sword. They are in a spiritual battle, and the weapons need to be sharpened for use. We are in spiritual warfare too, so this letter is for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that the sword is described as sharp. So it&amp;rsquo;s not just a double-edged sword; it&amp;rsquo;s a SHARP double-edged sword. If you were a surgeon, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a very good one if you operated with a dull scalpel. In the Bible, the sword is a well-established metaphor for the word of God. How sharp is your sword? When we read the letter to Ephesus, we looked at the armor of God passage in Ephesians 6. There is one crucial point to make, and it relates to having a sharp sword. The time to get fitted for the armor is before the battle. If you wait until you&amp;rsquo;re already in the middle of a fight, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to say it&amp;rsquo;s too late because better late than never; but doing it before the battle is the way to go. In the same way, you make sure your sword is sharpened before you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Christians believe that the double-edges refer to the Old and New Testaments, but we must remember that there was no New Testament in John&amp;rsquo;s day. The beginnings of a New Testament are still well over 100 years away. More precisely, it is the Law of Moses and the grace/Gospel of Jesus, as we see in John 1:17. Note that if your translation has a &amp;ldquo;but&amp;rdquo; after Moses, that word is not in the original, completely changing the meaning. Remove it from your thinking. Law, grace, and truth are not opposites. You can&amp;rsquo;t have grace and truth unless you have a standard of reference, which is the law. The opposite of law is lawlessness, as we see in 2 Thessalonians 2:8. The opposite of the Torah is to be without the Torah, i.e., without teaching the Scriptures. The opposite of grace is disgrace. As we see in Revelation 1:16 and 2:12, law and grace are two sides of the same sword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should always remember 2Ti 3:16-17: &amp;ldquo;All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, (17) that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luke 21:17 You will be hated by all for my name&amp;rsquo;s sake.  &lt;br&gt;Jude 1:4 For certain people have crept in unnoticed who long ago were designated for this condemnation, ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.  &lt;br&gt;2 Ti 2:12 if we endure, we will also reign with him; if we deny him, he also will deny us;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t know precisely what Jesus was referring to when He said &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Satan&amp;rsquo;s throne&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo; The worship of the Emperors, Zeus, and Aesculapius would each be viable candidates.  He could also have been referring to Pergamum in general, as a city that was the epicenter of false religion (second only to Rome in that regard).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;&amp;lsquo;The Unseen Realm&amp;rsquo;: Are Satan and the serpent one and the same?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Heiser&amp;rsquo;s book, The Unseen Realm, has a fascinating discussion on the distinction between the devil/serpent of Genesis 3 and &amp;ldquo;the Satan&amp;rdquo; of, say, Job 1. Heiser describes that in the earliest Jewish writings, &amp;ldquo;the Satan described in (Job 1) is not the devil. Rather he&amp;rsquo;s an anonymous prosecutor fulfilling a role in God&amp;rsquo;s council.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In other words, it appears the Satan&amp;rsquo;s (the accuser&amp;rsquo;s) role was to serve at God&amp;rsquo;s pleasure to test (in the sense of purifying) God&amp;rsquo;s people. Later, Jewish writings began to conflate the devil and the Satan. &amp;ldquo;The dark figure of Genesis 3 was eventually thought of as the &amp;lsquo;mother of all adversaries,&amp;rsquo; and so the label &lt;em&gt;satan&lt;/em&gt; got stuck to him. He deserves it.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heiser&amp;rsquo;s book is a scholarly yet most readable examination of the supernatural realm, with which most Christians are not familiar. It fits with a study of Revelation, and I highly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people&amp;rsquo;s first instinct would be to get away from such a city. It&amp;rsquo;s natural to want to be safe and comfortable, but we as believers have a different calling. Jesus said He came to seek the lost, and His instructions to us are to make talmidim disciples from all nations. A modern example might be Las Vegas. Many believers say they have no desire to go there. Suppose the purpose is not to participate in the sinful entertainment economy; that&amp;rsquo;s fine and wise in many cases. But if we think that God doesn&amp;rsquo;t or can&amp;rsquo;t love the people in that city caught up in sin, we are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminded me of a story. I grew up in a suburb of Los Angeles, and in the mid-70s, a former Los Angeles Dodger named Maury Wills came to speak at my elementary school. He played shortstop. He said there were two kinds of ballplayers. Those who said, &amp;ldquo;please, I hope he doesn&amp;rsquo;t hit the ball to me,&amp;rdquo; and those who said, &amp;ldquo;hit the ball to me. Hit the ball to me.&amp;rdquo; What type of Christian are you? What type am I? It&amp;rsquo;s natural to want things to be safe and comfortable, but the Bible nowhere promises this. Some of us need to first get in the game. Then once we are there, we need to say, &amp;ldquo;God, hit the ball to me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holding on to His name&lt;/strong&gt; does not mean they merely claimed to be Christians. As we&amp;rsquo;ve studied, the meaning of an English word such as &amp;ldquo;name&amp;rdquo; might be abstract, and the underlying Hebrew thought generally implies action. The word for name means one&amp;rsquo;s character and reputation. If we hold fast to His name, we aren&amp;rsquo;t just paying lip service. We are positively representing Him by our conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t know who &lt;strong&gt;Antipas&lt;/strong&gt; was except to say that was a prevalent name. Herod Antipas was the Herod who beheaded John the Baptist (Mar 6:22), hunted Jesus during His earthly ministry (Luke 13:31), and mocked Jesus at one of His trials (Luke 23:11), so obviously, this is a different Antipas. Church tradition holds that John appointed Antipas as bishop over Pergamum and that he healed people and expelled demons. He was put to death because he threatened the Asclepius cultic and economic system. As he was dying, he reportedly said, &amp;ldquo;your faith in gods is a false one.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The legend fits almost a little too perfectly with Pergamum, so we can&amp;rsquo;t discount the fact that some liberties might have been taken with the historical Antipas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(14) Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: you have some people who hold to the teaching of Bil`am, who taught Balak to set a trap for the people of Isra&amp;rsquo;el, so that they would eat food that had been sacrificed to idols and commit sexual sin. (15) Likewise, you too have people who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.&lt;/td&gt;

They have followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved gain from wrongdoing,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This letter gets our attention since Smyrna had zero things against and Ephesus had only one. When Jesus says, &amp;ldquo;I have &lt;strong&gt;a few things&lt;/strong&gt; against you,&amp;rdquo; it&amp;rsquo;s time to buckle up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;sexual immorality&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; as used in Rev 2:14 is most certainly literal, the Old Testament frequently sees idolatry as spiritual infidelity against God. It&amp;rsquo;s beyond our scope to give this the treatment it deserves, but many scholars see the Torah as a contact, specifically a marriage contract between God and His people (just as believers in Messiah are referred to as His Bride). Breaking that contract to follow another god is the same as breaking one&amp;rsquo;s wedding vows by sexual sin. Likely both are in view here at Pergamum. People claiming to be believers and followers of Jesus, his Bride, are &amp;ldquo;whoring&amp;rdquo; after the Roman gods, if for no other reason than to fit in with the rest of the society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the many cryptic references in these letters (and we assume they were not cryptic to the original audience), we know precisely what Jesus meant when He referred to &lt;strong&gt;Balaam and Balak&lt;/strong&gt;. The story spans Numbers 22-25, with a post-script in Numbers 31. Interestingly, this story immediately follows the episode of the bronze serpent (Num 21:4-9). Perhaps Jesus&#39; audience (at least the Jewish members) would have realized the connection.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Balaam and Balak&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/ace797f1b4043e5ae12ebd2d30e54349.png&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Balak was the king of the Moabites. Ammon and Moab were sons of Lot via incestual relations with his daughters. In other words, the Moabites were related to the grand-nephew of Abraham, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly get off to a stellar beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The territorial land of Moab is in the southern section of modern Jordan today. The Moabites and Israelites became foes when Israel asked to pass through Moab on their way to the Promised Land but were refused (a shocking violation of the usually obligatory middle eastern hospitality). In the photo, the Israelites were asking to pass through the land where the &amp;ldquo;Moab&amp;rdquo; label is. Balak feared a military incursion, but the Israelites genuinely only needed to use the well-traveled Kings Highway to reach a point to cross the Jordan and enter their land. Balak hired a well-known prophet named Balaam to curse the Israelites. He would be reimbursed for his troubles. Balaam, who appears to have had some sort of genuine line of communication with Adonai, the God of the Israelites, agreed, leading to his description as a &amp;ldquo;prophet for hire&amp;rdquo; or, as I like to say, &amp;ldquo;the for-profit prophet.&amp;rdquo; Repeatedly, as Balaam went to curse Israel, God intervened, and he was unable. This led Balak to think that maybe Balaam had been outbid by the Israelites to bless instead of curse. Balak offered an even sweeter compensation package, to which Balaam naturally agreed. This led to a literal &amp;ldquo;come to Jesus&amp;rdquo; meeting between Balaam, and the angel of the LORD, whom most Christians would say is a pre-incarnate appearance of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balaam&amp;rsquo;s donkey sees Jesus before Balaam does in a rather humorous episode. When the donkey stopped, Balaam kicked her and struck her. Then the donkey said, &amp;lsquo;what have I done to you that you have struck me these three times?&amp;rsquo; Not impressed that his donkey talked, he answered &amp;lsquo;because you have made a fool of me. I wish I had a sword in my hand, then I would kill you.&amp;rsquo; … Then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the lord with His drawn sword.&amp;quot; Despite explaining to Balak the situation, Balaam did what a lot of us do when we get an answer we don&amp;rsquo;t like from God. We keep asking. In the end, Balaam could do none other than blessing Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 24 ends with Balaam and Balak going their separate ways and a casual reading might lead us to believe that all of these shenanigans came to nothing. Chapter 25 begins with a seemingly unrelated episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Num 25:1-3 While Israel lived in Shittim, the people began to whore with the daughters of Moab. (2) These invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods. (3) So Israel yoked himself to Baal of Peor. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the episode Jesus references in Revelation 2:14 about eating food sacrificed to idols and practicing sexual immorality. As an aside, Numbers 25:4 and following describes what is known as the &amp;ldquo;zeal of Phinehas&amp;rdquo; who slew both the men of Israel and the Moabite women, thus stopping the plague that ultimately killed 24,000. This was no minor plague. This is where the term Zealots originated from as used in the New Testament. The Zealots were a group that agitated for the violent overthrow of Rome. Despite Jesus not aligning with this philosophy, many zealots aligned with Jesus thinking He might be a means to the end they wanted to achieve. Because of the number of people following Jesus, the Jewish and Roman authorities constantly feared a riot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then don&amp;rsquo;t read anything about Balaam until he is killed in a raid in Numbers 31:8. The Holy Spirit wanted us to know that Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba were killed, &amp;ldquo;and they also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword.&amp;rdquo; There is an exciting sword theme running through this section, isn&amp;rsquo;t there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t find out until Numbers 31:16 connects-the-dots for us that the episode in chapter 25 happened because Balaam told Balak how he could bring a curse upon Israel. If Moab made their pretty young ladies available to the Israelite men, the men wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to resist. Note that God didn&amp;rsquo;t directly curse the Moabites. After all, we could say they were acting like Moabites (which is why the book of Ruth the Moabitess is so astounding and a powerful picture of a gentile coming to faith in Israel&amp;rsquo;s God). God cursed the Israelites who were not acting the way Israelites should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what excuses they made. &amp;ldquo;just this once.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;no one will know.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Everybody&amp;rsquo;s doing it.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;God wants me to be happy.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I have freedom in Christ.&amp;rdquo; Ok maybe the Israelites didn&amp;rsquo;t use that last one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that is the story of Balaam and Balak. What Satan can&amp;rsquo;t accomplish externally through force and persecution, he can often achieve from within by leveraging the corruptible natures of the believers. If we are in Christ we are saved from the penalty of sin but, as long as we are alive on this earth and until He comes again, we must continually work to deal with the power of sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2nd Peter 2:15 tells us those who follow the way of Balaam love gain from wrongdoing. All of 2nd Peter chapter 2 is worth reading for additional context, but key verses would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Pe 2:1-3 But false prophets also arose among the people, &lt;strong&gt;just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them&lt;/strong&gt;, bringing upon themselves swift destruction. (2) And many will follow their sensuality, and the way of truth will be blasphemed because of them. (3) And in their greed, they will exploit you with false words. Their condemnation from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Pe 2:12-15 But these, like irrational animals, creatures of instinct, born to be caught and destroyed, blaspheming about matters of which they are ignorant, will also be destroyed in their destruction, (13) suffering wrong as the wage for their wrongdoing. They count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions, while they feast with you. (14) They have eyes full of adultery, insatiable for sin. They entice unsteady souls. They have hearts trained in greed. Accursed children! (15) Forsaking the right way, they have gone astray. &lt;strong&gt;They have followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved gain from wrongdoing&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Pe 2:19-21 They promise them freedom, but they are slaves of corruption. For whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved. (20) For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and &lt;strong&gt;overcome&lt;/strong&gt;, the last state has become worse for them than the first. (21) For &lt;strong&gt;it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are contemptuous words to be sure. If we don&amp;rsquo;t read carefully, it would be easy to think that verses 12-15 are talking about pagans.  However, verses 1 and 21 are clear. These people are &lt;strong&gt;PROFESSING BELIEVERS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These false teachers had slipped into the congregation(s) at Pergamum. Keener believes these false teachers &amp;ldquo;may be advocating compromise with the imperial cult&amp;hellip;and may have used their prophecies to commend themselves to elements of pagan universalism.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve already examined the Nicolaitans in the letter to Ephesus, but note Ephesus resisted while Pergamum tolerated. Jesus seems to equate whatever the Nicolaitans were doing with the sexual and dietary sins in the Balaam incident, which is why I believe the Nicholas (unrestrained sexual perversion no matter what the Bible says) or &amp;ldquo;Nochal&amp;rdquo; (we will eat all no matter what the Bible says), theories fit the context better &amp;ldquo;conquerors of the laity&amp;rdquo; theory for who the Nicolaitans were. To put it another way, the Nicolaitans used the same strategy to undermine the congregation at Pergamum that Balaam and Balak used to undermine Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the people to whom Jesus is directing verse 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-216-repent&#34;&gt;Rev 2:16 &amp;ldquo;Repent!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Revelation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(16) Therefore, turn from these sins. Otherwise, I will come to you very soon and make war against them with the sword of my mouth.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rev 19:15 And out of his mouth comes to a sharp sword with which to strike down nations—&amp;ldquo;He will rule them with a staff of iron.&amp;rdquo; It is he who treads the winepress from which flows the wine of the furious rage of Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies.  &lt;br&gt;Rev 19:21 The rest were killed with the sword that goes out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the Balaam references, the sword imagery is conspicuous (Num 22:23, 29, 31; 31:8, Joshua 13:22). In effect, Jesus is saying if the people are going to act like Balaam, they will meet with a similar ending. Jesus isn&amp;rsquo;t wielding a literal sword; He doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to. His literal words are plenty powerful. Also, there is the just punishment recorded in the Torah for those who follow in the way and the teaching of Balaam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we are starting to see the connection Jesus is building. When we take a more expansive view, the two judgments for the unrepentant (Ephesus and Pergamum) would seem to involve a forfeiture of eternal life. At Ephesus, Jesus said He would remove the menorah from its place. Since Jesus is in the midst of the menorah, he is talking about removing the unrepentant from His presence. Here, the unrepentant will receive the sword of judgment, which we can see fulfilled in Revelation 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the same lines, all the promises to the overcomers involve gaining eternal life. Ephesus would get to eat from the Tree of Life, Smyrna will be exempted from the second death, and below, Pergamum will eat of the &amp;ldquo;hidden manna.&amp;rdquo; We&amp;rsquo;ll describe the connection to eternal life in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the overcomers get to do these things, then we can logically assume that non-overcomers, the unsaved, do NOT get to do these things. Also, the Tree of Life was literal. The manna in the wilderness was literal food. We can assume the second death is also literal. In other words, Jesus is not merely speaking symbolically that believers will go to heaven and the unbelievers will go to hell. There is much more involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pergamum-gets-no-secondary-encouragement&#34;&gt;Pergamum gets no secondary encouragement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical letter has a judgment sandwiched between two separate words of praise and encouragement; a &amp;ldquo;praise sandwich&amp;rdquo; if you will.  Right here is the point where we would expect the secondary encouragement (e.g., &amp;ldquo;but you have those &lt;who are doing something good&gt;&amp;quot;).  This is absent for Pergamum.   Pergamum&amp;rsquo;s letter is open-faced, not a sandwich. An open faced sandwich is good if you&amp;rsquo;re trying to cut back on carbs, but not so good if you want to do good deeds that please your Master. Pergamum receives a praise and a judgment, but no closing secondary praise or encouragement. SO we get a clue that while the situation is not quite as dire as with Sardis and Laodicea, who get no praise, we do get the sense that something is fundamentally wrong with Pergamum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-217-promise-to-the-overcomer--ears&#34;&gt;Rev 2:17: Promise to the Overcomer / Ears&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(17) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities. To him winning the victory, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give him a white stone, on which is written a new name that nobody knows except the one receiving it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Exo 16:31-35 Now the house of Israel called its name manna. It was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. (32) Moses said, “This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations, so that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’” (33) And Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar, and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the LORD to be kept throughout your generations.” (34) As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the testimony to be kept. (35) The people of Israel ate the manna forty years, till they came to a habitable land. They ate the manna till they came to the border of the land of Canaan. &lt;br&gt;Joh 6:31 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the scholars I read describe some plausible conjectures but ultimately are forced to throw up their hands. There is a Jewish tradition regarding the hidden manna that both Keener and Lancaster note in their comments. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at each of these three elements as best we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;hidden-manna&#34;&gt;Hidden manna&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, I would refer anyone interested in unpacking this to review Craig Keener&amp;rsquo;s notes in the IVP Bible Background Commentary, New Testament, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bethimmanuel.org/audio/hidden-manna-and-white-stone&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Daniel Lancaster&amp;rsquo;s audio teaching&lt;/a&gt;. In summary, when God provided manna from heaven for the people to eat during the wilderness wanderings, he also instructed Aaron to take an omer of the manna (about two quarts) and keep it before Adonai. See Ex 16:31-36. After the Ark of the covenant was built, it was placed inside, with Aaron&amp;rsquo;s rod that budded in front of Pharoah and the copy of the 10 Commandments. As has been popularized by a very famous movie, the Ark seemingly vanished without a trace around the Babylonian conquest of 586 BCE. This has led to several speculations and traditions about where the ark and its contents might be. A Jewish tradition holds that Elijah will present the jar of the hidden manna to the Messiah at the start of the millennial kingdom.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Keener doesn&amp;rsquo;t go to this detail, but he notes that the pot of hidden manna will &amp;ldquo;be restored at the end time.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Lancaster is confident that Jesus is confirming this legend. In his view, it would have been impossible for Jesus&#39; first-century audience to have interpreted the phrase &amp;ldquo;hidden manna&amp;rdquo; as anything other than this legend.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the connection to the millennial kingdom, it is another way of saying those who get to partake of the hidden manna will receive eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is Jesus going to feed everyone from just one omer of manna? Apparently, another feeding miracle is still to come; only this time, it will hopefully be much more than 5000! Lastly, don&amp;rsquo;t miss the fact that the letters to Ephesus and Pergamum both mention the Nicolaitans, and both mention that the overcomers would eat clean and proper food. This may or may not be significant, but I think it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;white-stone&#34;&gt;White stone&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/cf5f12d5721fb19bdee09cb7ce67f7ae.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photo is a white stone with an inscription. It&amp;rsquo;s located in Pergamum, which calls to mind Revelation 2:17&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most commentators believe this was some kind of judicial procedure where a white stone signifies one is innocent and a black stone means one is guilty. Others said it was a type of admission ticket. So here, Jesus is simultaneously proclaiming the overcomers as innocent, which grants them admittance to the Messianic Banquet. Lizorkin speculates that of the twelve stones on the High Priests robe, the white one represented the tribe of Zebulun. Zebulun&amp;rsquo;s tribal allotment was Galilee of the nations, leading to the famous passage in Isaiah 9:1-7 about a child being born and a son given.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So the secret white stone could be the Messiah himself. For sure, these speculations may fit varying degrees, but as we will see later in our study, just because something fits doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that&amp;rsquo;s what God was communicating. I like the way the Believer&amp;rsquo;s Bible Commentary concluded their discussion. After listing all of the usual theories, &amp;ldquo;it seems clear that it is a reward given by the Lord to the overcomer and expressing individual approval by Him.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; That, my friends, is about all we can be sure of!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Civic pride and the Imperial Cult&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many visitors to Pergamum note the photo above and the inscription on a white stone. This recalls Jesus&#39; words. This photo above is a dedication to the town&amp;rsquo;s ancient gymnasium honoring the facility&amp;rsquo;s director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We mentioned in the Ephesus lesson that Ephesus and Pergamum had a bit of a rivalry. I grew up in Los Angeles, so that I can compare it to the LA San Francisco rivalry. Maybe New York and Boston is another example. The Romans would award a neokoros, which essentially means &amp;ldquo;temple warden.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s sort of like being selected to host the Olympics today. It was an honor and a big deal for that city. We mentioned earlier that Pergamum was the first to be named neokoros for its consecration and worship of Augustus. Later Smyrna and Ephesus would also gain that title for their temples. deSilva notes that Ephesus began to flaunt its recent title, which upset Pergamum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inscription on this stone says Pergamum was the FIRST to be awarded neokoros. Then when Pergamum received the honor of the temple to Trajan (after Revelation was written), they paraded the title &amp;ldquo;twice awarded neokoros.&amp;rdquo; Then after Ephesus won a second neokoros, Pergamos was then &amp;ldquo;first to be twice awarded.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may seem like a silly and fun rivalry, but DeSilva notes it ran much deeper. This demonstrates &amp;ldquo;how strong were the connections between civic pride and support for the imperial cult…at the very time that Christian witness against the legitimacy of (the)cult and resistance to participation was becoming sharper.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-new-name-that-nobody-knows&#34;&gt;A new name that nobody knows&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster and other commentators pointed out that the &amp;ldquo;new name&amp;rdquo; is the more important of the two. When God changed a name in the Old Testament, it indicated His approval and acceptance, and a promise usually accompanied it. As we mentioned above, a term in Hebraic thought denotes one&amp;rsquo;s character and, in some respects, one&amp;rsquo;s destiny. Review Genesis 49 and Jacob&amp;rsquo;s prophecies to the 12 tribes. He frequently invokes a translation of the son&amp;rsquo;s name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, note that this is the third and final letter where the promise to the overcomer occurs after the &amp;ldquo;those who have ears&amp;rdquo; statement. For the last four letters, the order will be reversed. We can speculate, but we are not told why this is. The more important aspect is remembering the Hebrew meaning of shamah and hearing. It means not just listening (or reading) but understanding and obeying what Jesus has to say. In fact, it is through obedience that we become overcomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The believers in Pergamum didn&amp;rsquo;t directly deny their Lord, which is to their credit, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t do the opposite either. They worshipped other gods alongside the One True God. Lizorkin writes of Pergamum, &amp;ldquo;only one God can be worshipped and adored,&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:21&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or as Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;no one can serve two masters.&amp;rdquo; Just like the rich young ruler, we must make a choice. In our day, Satan likes to trick us, believers, into thinking that we aren&amp;rsquo;t worshipping whatever it is we actually are worshipping (the sports team, the car, the job, or the toys or websites that captivate our attention; or the doctors and the medicines that supposedly heal us and save us from sickness). After all, it&amp;rsquo;s not like we&amp;rsquo;re bowing down to them or holding them up in the air while praying to Baal, Aesculepius, or some other god. Keep in mind the thing we worship doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have to be sinful. In our economy, a job is necessary. But when one becomes married to their job, it becomes an idol. We need a car to get from place to place. But when we use a vehicle to communicate our status, it becomes a problem. There is nothing inherently wrong with money. Money is not the root of all evil. That is a misquote. The Bible says, &amp;ldquo;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.&amp;rdquo; Stiles notes, &amp;ldquo;today there is a false god for anything and everything, and they offer immediate satisfaction. But they are not the truth.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:22&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In contrast, Jesus doesn&amp;rsquo;t always offer immediate satisfaction. He requires trust, faith, and obedience. With the constant references in these letters to our being rewarded in the afterlife, believers must be willing to exchange a comfortable, instant gratification life today for the promise of not just greater, but the most significant rewards later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this in mind, think about where you and I are worshiping other gods alongside God?. Where are you (and I) married to the world? These are questions each of us must wrestle with and ask God to expose any areas where we need correction. As we said in a previous lesson, ask God to audit the books of your life. Each letter ends with &amp;ldquo;he who has an ear let him hear….&amp;rdquo; These letters are written for us today to examine ourselves and correct where needed so we can walk in faithful obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;church-age-theory&#34;&gt;Church age theory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proponents of the church age theory see Pergamum as representative of the State church, married to the world&amp;rsquo;s system of idolatry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In history, this started in 311, with the &amp;ldquo;Edict of Toleration,&amp;rdquo; which decriminalized Christianity and ended the official Roman persecution. Later Constantine would officially recognize Christianity, with the emperor himself &amp;ldquo;converting&amp;rdquo; to Christianity and legalizing Christianity in 313 with the Edict of Milan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are right to question the genuineness of his conversion, with skeptics viewing it as a pragmatic move to unify the people. In 285, Emperor Diocletian believed the Roman empire was getting too large. Hence, he not only divided it between east and west, each region would also have co-regents to help with administrative tasks. The senior administrator held Augustus&amp;rsquo;s title, while the junior administrator was titled, Caesar. There were four emperors, called a Tetrarchy. As Cargill rhetorically asked his class, &amp;ldquo;how many of you think this is going to work well?&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:23&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:23&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s like a family arrangement that starts as a good idea. When someone dies, and there are issues of succession and inheritance (and ego), it turns into a mess. This is exactly what happened. Constantine was the son of Constantius, who was the Caesar of the western half. He wanted it all and ultimately went to war with Maxentius, his counterpart in the East. Missler writes, &amp;ldquo;in 312 A.D: Constantine set out to defeat the forces of Maxentius, his rival, for supreme power in the empire. It is said that on the next day he saw a shining cross (or a &amp;ldquo;chi-rho&amp;rdquo;) in the sky with an inscription above it: &lt;em&gt;in hoc signo vinces:&lt;/em&gt; “In this sign, thou shalt conquer.” He defeated Maxentius at the Milvian bridge and immediately declared his conversion to Christianity.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:24&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:24&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus&#39; pacifist message of &amp;ldquo;turn the other cheek&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;My kingdom is not of this earth&amp;rdquo; was now replaced by a conquering Christian army who will now maim and kill in the name of Jesus. Keep this in mind when we get to the parable of the Mustard seed becoming something it was never intended to be in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, what was once a wholly Jewish faith, first called &amp;ldquo;the way&amp;rdquo; (דֶרֶך in Hebrew) is now being infiltrated by Greco-Roman philosophy to the point where it was now not only unrecognizable and incompatible with the Judaism Jesus taught, but many different gentile Christian splinter groups formed that were largely incompatible with each other. For example, groups debated the nature of Jesus and His relationship to the father. Some held he was a spirit being only (which has its roots in Gnosticism). Others held He was fully man and was only later adopted by God. Nearly everyone didn&amp;rsquo;t like the fact that He was Jewish. We can imagine the debate and infighting. This was often along geographic lines between those in the eastern and western parts of the empire, and these divisions are still around today. Constantine, pragmatically, saw an opportunity to unify the empire by bringing all these groups together to define Christian orthodoxy. In 324 was the Council of Nicaea, which resulted in the Nicene Creed and the doctrine of the Trinity. We can argue that the Creed is a good thing, but we can&amp;rsquo;t discount the fallout. Those who didn&amp;rsquo;t believe exactly the way the Council decided were now no longer Christians. This included Jewish believers. They were heretics, and heretics are burned at the stake. Ironically today, we have just as many if not more divisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Missler says, &amp;ldquo;The underground Christians exchanged the rags of oppression for the silks of the court.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:25&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:25&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few decades later, Theodosius made Christianity the official state religion of the Roman Empire. It was now not only the &amp;ldquo;in thing&amp;rdquo; to be a Christian, it was required. This led to many otherwise unregenerate people getting baptized. On that note, infant baptism was instituted, and now one was a Christian from birth no matter how they lived. Christianity didn&amp;rsquo;t immediately replace the Roman Imperial cult but existed alongside it. So the pagan practices of eating food sacrificed to idols and sexual immorality co-existed along with Christian traditions. Think of the pagan temple as a corner convenience store that now has a sign &amp;ldquo;under new management.&amp;rdquo; There may be some cosmetic changes, but it&amp;rsquo;s still the same convenience store. Temples were now Christian churches, and the pagan priests were now &amp;ldquo;Christian&amp;rdquo; priests. Pagan festivals such as spring fertility and winter solstice (longest night) were morphed into Easter and Christmas. As Missler says, &amp;ldquo;The underground Christians exchanged the rags of oppression for the silks of the court.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:25&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:25&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might be surprised how many practices from this time are still around today. Interestingly, it was the Jewish Christians who spoke out against this. For this, they now became the persecuted ones. Saturday worship was forbidden; Resurrection Sunday, instead of being the Jewish feast of Firstfruits, was intentionally disassociated from Passover (which remains today). Eating ham on Easter Sunday was instituted to isolate Jewish believers further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler points out that during this period is when symbolic and allegoric interpretations of scripture came to the forefront. In some respects, this might make sense. Jerusalem has been destroyed, which was predicted by Jesus, who often said that His kingdom was not of this world. There was also an ulterior motive by those in charge. In other words, the world&amp;rsquo;s corrupt rulers couldn&amp;rsquo;t edit out the part of the Bible that said Jesus is coming back to rid the world of its corrupt rulers. This was when the amillennial interpretation of the end times was popularized. Jesus is not coming again physically; He will rule in our hearts. This is a remnant of Gnostic philosophy that held that the physical is bad—only the spiritual matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another significant difference between the amillennial and those who hold a millennial worldview is the mission and destiny of the church. Amillennialists believe the church will grow and grow by political might to become an unstoppable force for good. Things will get better and better until, eventually, we will achieve Eden once again. The millennial kingdom is just another way of saying the church. Those who believe in a literal millennial kingdom would read the Bible that Satan oversees this world. The church is here to spread the Gospel, make disciples, and be a light in a dark world. Ultimately the world goes from bad to worse until Jesus intervenes. One group says it gets better and better, and the other group says it goes from bad to worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cargill sums up this period by saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Constantine is responsible for much of what we know as modern Christianity, for better and for worse.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:26&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:26&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;parables-pergamum--mustard-seed-mat-1331-32&#34;&gt;Parables: Pergamum = Mustard Seed (Mat 13:31-32)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
Mat 13:31 Yeshua put before them another parable. &#34;The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed which a man takes and sows in his field.
&lt;br&gt;Mat 13:32 It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it grows up, it is more significant than any garden plant and becomes a tree, so that the birds flying about come and nest in its branches.&#34;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garden plant:
:What the ecclesia should be according to Jesus. Typically, a mustard plant is a bush only a few feet high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tree:
:Many Christians see this as the church as growing and growing in greatness. In the context of something that should only be the size of a garden plant, having this grow into a tree represents a monstrosity. The thing has grown into something it was never intended to become. A compromised and carnal church that tolerates pagan practices of idolatry and sexual immorality and has made Christianity something Jesus never taught or intended it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birds of the air:
:Ministers of Satan (Matthew 13:19). The &amp;ldquo;birds of the air&amp;rdquo; from the first parable are ministers of Satan; it would be most unusual if Jesus changed the symbolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nest in its branches:
:The ministers of Satan set up shop, became this church&amp;rsquo;s leaders, and led the people astray just like Balaam/Balak did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning
:The suggestion is that what started small and was supposed to be a plant has become a monstrosity. It has become something it was never intended to be. It is so large that ministers can not just land but make nests, i.e., make a home, in its branches.
:Jesus said to carry a weapon for defense only, and even this was unusual. When He was arrested, He told the disciples to put their swords down. For all intents and purposes, Jesus&#39; earthly ministry was a model of pacifism.
:Now with the advent of Constantine, we see the church as a conqueror, both politically and militarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;paul-pergamumcorinthians&#34;&gt;Paul: Pergamum=Corinthians&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler sees the Pauline tie-in for Pergamum as the letters to the Corinthians.  1st Corinthians in particular deals with the carnal church, as exemplified by 1 Cor 5:1.  Below are a few verses to illustrate similar issues happening in both Corinth and Pergamum.  We recommend a thorough study of 1/2 Corinthians in conjunction with our study of Pergamum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Co 2:12 Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Co 3:1-3 But I, brothers, could not address you as spiritual people, but as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ. (2) I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not ready for it. And even now you are not yet ready, (3) for you are still of the flesh. For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh and behaving only in a human way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Co 3:4 For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not being merely human? (&lt;em&gt;Greek culture divinized human heroes into gods.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Co 3:16-17 Do you not know that you are God&amp;rsquo;s temple and that God&amp;rsquo;s Spirit dwells in you? (17) If anyone destroys God&amp;rsquo;s temple, God will destroy him. For God&amp;rsquo;s temple is holy, and you are that temple. (&lt;em&gt;This correlates to the dietary and fleshly fornication happening at Pergamum.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1Co 4:2 Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1Co 4:5 Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive his commendation from God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1Co 5:1 It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, for a man has his father&amp;rsquo;s wife. (&lt;em&gt;Chapter 5 is all about sexual immorality.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1Co 5:11 But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler—not even to eat with such a one. (&lt;em&gt;Paul sounds awfully judgmental here.  Are we sure the Paul of the New Testament is the same Paul we have been taught?&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1Co 6:12-13 “All things are lawful for me,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful for me,” but I will not be dominated by anything. 13 “Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food”—and God will destroy both one and the other. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. (&lt;em&gt;The ESV does an excellent job of setting off the quotes. Paul is not saying these directly. He is quoting the arguments of his opponents. Read this carefully. Just as Paul is not saying sexual fornication is lawful (God forbid!), he neither is saying all food is OK. Could &amp;ldquo;we eat all because all things are permissible&amp;rdquo; be a teaching of the Nicolaitans we have all fallen for? Asking for a friend!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

We can also see the serpent imagery proudly displayed on this coin from Pergamum.

&lt;th&gt;Revelation 2:18-29&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Thyatira, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the Son of God, whose eyes are like a fiery flame and whose feet are like burnished brass: (19) I know what you are doing, your love, trust, service, and perseverance. And I know that you are doing more now than before. (20) But I have this against you: you continue to tolerate that Izevel woman, the one who claims to be a prophet, but is teaching and deceiving my servants to commit sexual sin and eat food that has been sacrificed to idols. (21) I gave her time to turn from her sin, but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to repent of her immorality. (22) So I am throwing her into a sickbed; and those who commit adultery with her I am throwing into great trouble unless they turn from the sins connected with what she does; (23) and I will strike her children dead! Then all the Messianic communities will know that I am the one who searches minds and hearts and that I will give to each of you what your deeds deserve. (24) But to the rest of you in Thyatira, to those who do not hold this teaching, who have not learned what some people call the &amp;lsquo;deep things&amp;rsquo; of the Adversary, I say this: I am not loading you up with another burden; (25) only hold fast to what you have until I come. (26) To him who wins the victory and does what I want until the goal is reached, I will give him authority over the nations; (27) he will rule them with a staff of iron and dash them to pieces like pottery, (28) just as I have received authority from my Father. I will also give him the morning star. (29) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.&amp;rdquo; &#39;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;thyatira-background&#34;&gt;Thyatira Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/159dbe0ff890eaf317e21c9759ccb3e3.png&#34; cap=&#34;Thyatira map&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thyatira is located 42 miles inland on a flat plain. Its location was bad from a military perspective but good from a trade perspective. Thyatira was strategically located on a highway connecting it with Pergamum and Troas (and today Istanbul) to the north, Smyrna to the west, and Sardis to the south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thyatira is related to θυγάτηρ, thygater, or &amp;ldquo;daughter.&amp;rdquo; After Seleucus I (Nicator) took control of the city in 301 BCE, he named the location θυατειροις (Thyateirois) in honor of his daughter.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many devotional (as opposed to scholarly) commentaries reflect that the name means &amp;ldquo;continual sacrifice,&amp;rdquo; but only one scholarly reference that I could identify confirmed this, and this author did so without providing any references supporting the Greek interpretation.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m skeptical of this interpretation. It sounds more to me like Protestant commentators contrived these meanings as a dig towards Catholics to support the &amp;ldquo;Church Age Theory&amp;rdquo; linking Thyatira to the Catholic/Papal church and the Doctrine of the Mass. Despite differences Protestants may have with Catholic doctrine (and vice-versa), we must be devoted to the truth, not Protestant folklore. I will be glad to post a correction to this paragraph should I come across a hard source supporting one of these alternate names as a potential interpretation of the Koine Greek. Until this time, I would encourage readers to be equally skeptical. &amp;ldquo;Daughter&amp;rdquo; appears to be a straightforward Greek interpretation and is entirely consistent with the extra-biblical historical narrative. Remember Acts 17:11, which is our charge to accept the truth and reject falsehoods, no matter how much they may &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo; or how much we may wish they were true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does have more scholarly support, though still disputed, is that a former name of the city was &amp;ldquo;Semiramis,&amp;rdquo; a mythical goddess common to multiple ancient cultures. Again, in what is likely to be a Protestant misunderstanding (taking a charitable view of it), a book written in 1853 puts forth the suggestion that Semiramis was the mother of Nimrod, the Bible&amp;rsquo;s first apostate, and they had an incestuous relationship resulting in Tammuz and the Babylonian pagan system which ultimately found their way into the Catholic Church&amp;rsquo;s practices. There is no historical record supporting the book&amp;rsquo;s claims, yet to this day, they are passed on as true by many Protestant commentators. So while it was true that Thyatira was likely named Semiramis, the mythical Semiramis&amp;rsquo; connection to the Catholic church seems entirely fabricated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can speculate that the reasons protestant commentators go to such lengths to force a connection between Thyatira and the Catholic Church are twofold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is where the Church-Age Theory (largely a Protestant creation) starts to feel contrived.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People can feel the need to force evidence to support a theory where no evidence exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not to say that there aren&amp;rsquo;t any parallels. Instead of spreading urban legends, all they needed to do was focus on the historical Jezebel (which WE will do once we get to verse 20!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we hold to the theory, the next church, Sardis, would represent the Reformation period. There is NOTHING good said about Sardis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not saying connections aren&amp;rsquo;t there, but let&amp;rsquo;s not oversell them. Our job is to be true to the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter to Thyatira is the longest of the seven letters, but it is the city we know the least about. It seems fair to perhaps label it the &amp;ldquo;least significant&amp;rdquo; of the seven cities, but we don&amp;rsquo;t know what secrets the earth holds. This is because archaeological excavations have been limited by the modern city of Akhisar (~ 30,000 people).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/a9b38e7232457060274689fa53494404.jpg&#34; cap=&#34;Thyatira Greek Inscription mentioning wool workers &#34; width=&#34;30%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentary evidence, including the Book of Acts, does demonstrate that the city was known for its trade guilds. Various inscriptions found, such as the one in the photo, list some of these guilds: wool workers, linen-workers, makers of outer garments, dyers, leather-workers, tanners, potters, bakers, slave-dealers and bronze-smiths.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Evidence indicates that the city was at the height of its prosperity in the very late 1st century, exactly when they would have received this letter. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guilds gathered at the temple of Apollo.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In Greek mythology, Apollo is also the twin brother of Artemis, which we studied at Ephesus, and the father of Asclepius at Pergamum. He is the god of music and the arts and also the Sun. As we have learned in the previous letters, just about everything in Roman society was connected with the worship of the Roman gods. The worship of Apollo included lots of sex, eating, and drinking.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, guild worship wasn&amp;rsquo;t simply an annual or quarterly business meeting where one could pinch his nose and suffer through it. &amp;ldquo;Each guild had its own god, pagan feasts, celebrations, and other rituals.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In other words, it was inescapable, ongoing worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/348bc9668852b3e79fde186f3fb02ab4.jpg&#34; cap=&#34;Thyatira arches along colonnaded Roman street tb01217839&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus will again reference sexual immorality and eating things sacrificed to idols. Thyatira may have been committing the same sins but for different reasons. At Thyatira, believers involved with one of the trades represented by the guilds were placed in a seemingly impossible situation. If he didn&amp;rsquo;t participate in the Apollo worship (or whichever other god a given trade venerated), he would be expelled from the guild.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The equivalent today would be having your business license revoked or being blacklisted by those in power. You would not be allowed to practice your trade or craft. If you went along with it, even half-heartedly, you were a compromiser, and we know from the previous letters how Jesus feels about compromisers versus those who remain true to His name. While whoever &amp;ldquo;Jezebel&amp;rdquo; was evidently was advocating compromise, Jesus told them it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth it, literally. It&amp;rsquo;s too expensive in that there is too much at state eternally.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;images/bf20910f6a8d217c1326880130576481.jpeg&#34; cap=&#34;Skins dyed with madder root (Rubia tinctorum)&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thyatira receives only one other mention outside the book of Revelation. Acts 16:14 tells us that Paul met Lydia in Philippi, and she was his first convert in that city. Lydia was a Jew from Thyatira and was a seller of the rare purple (or scarlet) dye mentioned by Homer in the Iliad. While there is a theory that holds the dye is made from sea muscles, Thyatira&amp;rsquo;s inland location would support the alternative theory that the dye is plant-based from the madder root.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The photo shows skins dyed with madder root (Rubia tinctorum).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Bolen adds, &amp;ldquo;The process of extracting the dye was not a simple or quick one, causing the dyed cloth to be expensive.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears the area was largely unoccupied (or at best an insignificant outpost) for most of the middle ages, with Akhisar being refounded in the Ottoman period. Since 1922 there have been no Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;prelude&#34;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/c050e87a7820537411de7a3f4275a9e6.jpeg&#34; cap=&#34;(Modern Akhisar) Thyatira Pasha Mosque plaza, tb041505725&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to find that the issues of following in the ways of Balaam/Pergamum and Jezebel/Thyatira are very closely related in that they both involve compromise. Balaam wants to come alongside God and offer you something extra. Balaam couldn&amp;rsquo;t curse Israel, but he did entice and ensnare them. Balaam says it&amp;rsquo;s ok to have one foot worshipping Israel&amp;rsquo;s God as long as you have one foot in the world, worshipping the things of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jezebel is in opposition and wants to corrupt God. In other words, even the one foot that you are following God with is changed into something it&amp;rsquo;s not supposed to be. Both are bad. Satan will use either one or any combination to attack you and me and keep us from worshipping Him how He requires. This includes our ability to deceive ourselves into thinking ___ is ok (fill in the blank), even though God has said it&amp;rsquo;s not. &amp;ldquo;The danger to the church at Thyatira arose from within the church itself – all the more serious and dangerous to deal with.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler noted three &amp;ldquo;tares&amp;rdquo; in the early church based on the letters so far:&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legalism– this is a denial of Christ&amp;rsquo;s work
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Legalism&amp;rdquo; means a certain work is required &lt;em&gt;in order to merit salvation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holding ourselves to a high standard of behavior and performance as a RESPONSE TO Christ&amp;rsquo;s work is not legalism
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accusers of the brethren disparage good works as &amp;ldquo;legalism.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;td&gt;18 &amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Thyatira, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the Son of God, whose eyes are like a fiery flame and whose feet are like burnished brass:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Psa 2:7 I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, “You are my Son; today I have begotten you.  &lt;br&gt; Dan 10:6 His body was like beryl, his face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude. &lt;br&gt; Mal 3:2-4 But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner&amp;rsquo;s fire and like fullers&amp;rsquo; soap. (3) He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, and they will bring offerings in righteousness to the LORD. (4) Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD as in the days of old and as in former years.  &lt;br&gt; Mat 3:17 and behold, a voice from heaven said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”  &lt;br&gt; Mat 16:15-16 He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” (16) Simon Peter replied, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”  &lt;br&gt; Joh 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be surprising to learn that this is the only instance of &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Son of God&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; mentioned in Revelation. A local allusion may be in reference to the Apollo worship in the city. Apollo is the Son of Zeus. In English (but not in Greek), there is an unintended pun in that Apollo is also the sun god. There are lots of verses in both Testaments referencing God&amp;rsquo;s Son. We have a few listed here. Although it sounds counter-intuitive, the Bible uses the phrase &amp;ldquo;Son of God&amp;rdquo; to emphasize one&amp;rsquo;s humanity, while the Son of Man (except for the book of Ezekiel) represents the messiah&amp;rsquo;s divinity. The &amp;ldquo;one like a son of man&amp;rdquo; is always a diety in Daniel and also here in Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is noteworthy that Son of God is not a title mentioned in Revelation 1. Note that we aren&amp;rsquo;t just relying on an angel, messenger, or human. This is the Son of God. The Son is an Heir to all things. Messiah is fully divine and fully human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eyes like a fiery flame&lt;/strong&gt; could refer to the fact that He has been watching the goings-on in Thyatira as He watches all assemblies. This letter is notable in that there is no offer for the wicked to repent because &amp;quot; I gave her time to turn from her sin, but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to repent of her immorality.&amp;rdquo; Likely it was a leader of the congregation who pointed out these heresies of the one called Jezebel, but Jesus, like the second witness required by the Torah, says, &amp;ldquo;I saw everything that happened. You&amp;rsquo;re guilty, and you know it.&amp;rdquo; Lest we get smug, He could say that to us too; let us repent of whatever we need to repent of while we still have time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire,&lt;/strong&gt; in this case, could mean either the fires of judgment (for the unbeliever) or purifying fires that refine for believers. A refiner&amp;rsquo;s fire removes things in our life that don&amp;rsquo;t need to be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burnished brass&lt;/strong&gt; is likely a local allusion to the bronzesmith&amp;rsquo;s guild in Thyatira. Thyatira was a leading manufacturer of bronze helmets for the Roman army. In conjunction with fire, brass withstands fire up to 1800 degrees Fahrenheit. Biblically, it is often used as a symbol of judgment, as with the bronze serpent we reviewed in the letter to Pergamum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While five of the seven letters describe a judgment, this letter seems to have a unique emphasis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(19) I know what you are doing, your love, trust, service, and perseverance. And I know that you are doing more now than before.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Job 17:9  Yet the righteous holds to his way,  and he who has clean hands grows stronger and stronger.&lt;br&gt;  Pro 4:18  But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn,  which shines brighter and brighter until full day.&lt;br&gt;  John 15:2 Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.&lt;br&gt; Gal 5:22-23 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, (23) gentleness, self-control; against such things, there is no law. &lt;br&gt;Th 1:3 We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers, as is right, because your faith is growing abundantly, and the love of every one of you for one another is increasing.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He concludes a longer list of positive things by saying He knows they are doing more than before. This contrasts with Ephesus, who started strong but fell off. Everyone can start well; it takes determination to finish well. Coasting is not consistent with the Christian walk. If you think you&amp;rsquo;re coasting, you&amp;rsquo;re actually moving backward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is natural to continue to verse 20 without reflecting on verse 19. These are the things we need to focus on as believers. Several are duplicates of the Fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5. This parallel is noteworthy as some scholars see Galatians as the Pauline tie-in for Thyatira.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gal 5:22-23 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, (23) gentleness, self-control; against such things, there is no law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love – Love for God and love for one another needs to be the first priority of our works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trust/Faith – confidence and faithfulness to God – clinging to the promises that are as yet unseen despite our circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Service – sacrificial selflessness in giving our time, talents, and possessions to one another in His name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perseverance – longsuffering for the Master, various trials without bitterness or retaliation. Patient endurance with one another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving – they are getting better at doing all of the above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What wonderful words to hear from Jesus. I read a &amp;ldquo;lifehack&amp;rdquo; a while ago. The instructions were to write two obituaries for yourself. Make the first one painfully truthful – describe you as you truly know yourself, including the stuff you hide from others (or what you may THINK you are hiding, but maybe not hiding so well). Make the second one the one you would want to be read at your funeral. Are there differences between the two versions? If so, make course corrections will you still have time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would definitely want it said I exemplified these five things, especially by Jesus. Which of these do you do I need to work on? Are there areas where we used to be stronger, but we have fallen off? Redeem the time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one warning with perseverance or patient endurance, and it comes in verse 20. It is possible to be TOO patient with people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(20) But I have this against you: you continue to tolerate that Izevel woman, the one who claims to be a prophet, but is teaching and deceiving my servants to commit sexual sin and eat food that has been sacrificed to idols.  &lt;br&gt;(21) I gave her time to turn from her sin, but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to repent of her immorality.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deu 13:1-5 “If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or a wonder, (2) and the sign or wonder that he tells you comes to pass, and if he says, ‘Let us go after other gods,’ which you have not known, ‘and let us serve them,’ (3) you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams. … (5) But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death because he has taught rebellion against the LORD your God…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toleration&lt;/strong&gt; is the great buzzword of our age. In fact, the world tells us that tolerance is the greatest virtue ever in the history of humankind. In typical Satan fashion, he takes a verse like &amp;ldquo;love your neighbor&amp;rdquo; and tells us that the command means we must accept every sin and vice imaginable in the name of &amp;ldquo;tolerance.&amp;rdquo; Of course, those same people become most intolerant of people who don&amp;rsquo;t think as they do. And those targets are often Christians and Jews, which tells me right there that the battle is spiritual, not physical. Jesus says the wrong kind of toleration is not just a sin but evidence of a lack of salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this is exactly what happens when someone rises up and divides a community of believers – everyone tolerates it. Note the bigger sin is not Jezebel herself but those who tolerate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Izevel&lt;/strong&gt; could mean &amp;ldquo;what garbage&amp;rdquo; in Hebrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely the Thyatiran false prophetess was literally named Jezebel, as that would be an unusual name in that region. Some commentators speculate that this may be a corrosive philosophy, not a literal person, but we must note Jesus says that they tolerate &amp;ldquo;that woman.&amp;rdquo; This appears to be a continuation of the deeds of the Nicolaitans. The order is inverted compared to Pergamum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Rev 2:14 so that they might eat food sacrificed to idols and practice sexual immorality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Rev 2:20 seducing my servants to practice sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As discussed with Pergamum, sexual immorality may be physical or spiritual. Anytime God&amp;rsquo;s people are unfaithful and allow other idols to be worshiped, He views that as spiritual cheating. It is clear that Jezebel and those at other fellowships are preaching that the requirements of Acts 15:28-29 are to be ignored. Lancaster describes, &amp;ldquo;this teaching allows you to live in both worlds. You could have your salvation AND eat food sacrificed to idols and participate in the lax moral standards of society, ignoring the stricter rules of monogamous Jewish fidelity.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; She is teaching others to set aside the authority (a term used below) of the Apostles. Jesus will say what actual authority is in verse 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, this is an allusion to the Jezebel of the Old Testament. Jezebel would undoubtedly be among the top 5 greatest Old Testament villains. She was a Phoenician princess who married the Kings of Israel to secure a profitable trade alliance. &amp;ldquo;Of all the women seen in the Old Testament, none was more cunning, daring, or unscrupulous&amp;rdquo; than Jezebel.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In contrast to Balaam, who brought paganism alongside the worship of Israel&amp;rsquo;s god, Jezebel brought paganism instead of the worship of Israel&amp;rsquo;s God. It&amp;rsquo;s a fine line, but it might help to think of Balaam (technically not an Israelite) as an external attack and Jezebel (an Israelite by marriage) as representing an internal attack. In either case, the outcome is the same. God&amp;rsquo;s people compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Jezebel&amp;rsquo;s Religious System: Elijah at Mt. Carmel&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;images/24239523d7c57137ed25e082d72fccb5.jpeg&#34; cap=&#34;amaria Jezreel Valley Map, PLBL 2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When we go to Israel, we typically visit Mount Carmel and remember Elijah&amp;rsquo;s famous showdown with the priests of Baal recorded in 1 Kings 18. Elijah proposed a duel between Adonai and Baal; whichever god could bring fire from heaven and consume a sacrifice, that god would be the true god. The other fact is Elijah was the underdog of sorts. There were 450 prophets of Baal versus only Elijah. Baal was up first. Despite the pleadings and theatrics from Baal&amp;rsquo;s priests, along with some Monty Python-esque taunting from Elijah, nothing happens. Then it&amp;rsquo;s Adonai&amp;rsquo;s turn. Elijah even gives himself a handicap by dousing his altar with water multiple times. God delivers. Of course, those who are cheering for the home team are happy and celebratory.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;img src=&#34;images/cac94a62e71f3125c1cc36c13bc976e4.jpeg&#34; cap=&#34;Muhraqa statue, tb n011400 sr&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Elijah reminds us that this is not a football game. This is serious. 1Ki 18:40 &amp;ldquo;And Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.” And they seized them. And Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon and slaughtered them there. &amp;quot; Comingling of foreign gods must not be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode started by mentioning that Jezebel sought to exterminate the Prophets of Adonai, the true prophets (1 Kings 18:13). This location is a reminder that our faith must be pure and unadulterated. We follow the Bible. There is another story that we might say is &amp;ldquo;quintessential Jezebel.&amp;rdquo; It is the story of Naboth&amp;rsquo;s Vineyard in 1 Kings 21.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Quintessential Jezebel: Naboth&amp;rsquo;s Vineyard&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1Ki 21:1-23 Now Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel, beside the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. (2) And after this Ahab said to Naboth, “Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near my house, and I will give you a better vineyard for it; or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its value in money.” (3) But Naboth said to Ahab, “The LORD forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers.” (4) And Ahab went into his house vexed and sullen because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had said to him, for he had said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” And he lay down on his bed and turned away his face and would eat no food. (5) But Jezebel, his wife, came to him and said to him, “Why is your spirit so vexed that you eat no food?” (6) And he said to her, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, ‘Give me your vineyard for money, or else, if it please you, I will give you another vineyard for it.’ And he answered, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’” (7) And Jezebel, his wife, said to him, “Do you now govern Israel? Arise and eat bread and let your heart be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.” (8) So she wrote letters in Ahab&amp;rsquo;s name and sealed them with his seal, and she sent the letters to the elders and the leaders who lived with Naboth in his city. (9) And she wrote in the letters, “Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people. (10) And set two worthless men opposite him, and let them bring a charge against him, saying, ‘You have cursed God and the king.’ Then take him out and stone him to death.” (11) And the men of his city, the elders and the leaders who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent word to them. As it was written in the letters that she had sent to them, (12) they proclaimed a fast and set Naboth at the head of the people. (13) And the two worthless men came in and sat opposite him. And the worthless men brought a charge against Naboth in the presence of the people, saying, “Naboth cursed God and the king.” So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death with stones. (14) Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, “Naboth has been stoned; he is dead.” (15) As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, “Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money, for Naboth is not alive, but dead.” (16) And as soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;img src=&#34;images/049ccecfdf8ed8f7935214dd354741be.jpeg&#34; cap=&#34;Jezreel with grapevines, tb053005443&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;(17) Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, (18) “Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria; behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession. (19) And you shall say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD, “Have you killed and also taken possession?”’ And you shall say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD: “In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your own blood.”’” (20) Ahab said to Elijah, “Have you found me, O my enemy?” He answered, “I have found you because you have sold yourself to do what is evil in the sight of the LORD. (21) Behold, I will bring disaster upon you. I will utterly burn you up and will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel. (22) And I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the anger to which you have provoked me, and because you have made Israel to sin. (23) And of Jezebel, the LORD also said, ‘The dogs shall eat Jezebel within the walls of Jezreel.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is Jezebel. Pure evil. Those of a particular political persuasion see some parallels between Jezebel and a certain contemporary American politician, but we won&amp;rsquo;t get into that here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is one reason some commentators link the Letter to Thyatira with the Roman Catholic church. They acquired many of their lands through means like these and killed many of their enemies through false accusations. The most notorious episode is the Spanish Inquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About all, we can deduce from the Revelation text is that the Jezebel of Thyatira advocated for continuing worship at the trade guilds when Jesus would have His people remain pure and undefiled. This Jezebel didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have to be a rotten human being, but her doctrine definitely was wretched. However, as we can see from 1 Kings, calling someone &amp;ldquo;Jezebel&amp;rdquo; was NOT a compliment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because she calls herself a &lt;strong&gt;prophetess&lt;/strong&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that she is one. We are called to test the spirits and discern. Prophetesses were frequently leaders of Roman cults, but we see prophetesses in the New Testament as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teaching and deceiving my servants.&lt;/strong&gt; Deuteronomy 13 deals with the punishments for those who encourage the worship of other gods. Generally, it&amp;rsquo;s death. We are to have NO TOLERANCE for those who do such things. It is worth reading the chapter in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;

For the LORD your God is testing you, to know whether you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul. (4) You shall walk after the LORD your God and fear him and keep his commandments and obey his voice, and you shall serve him and hold fast to him. (5) But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he has taught rebellion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the house of slavery, to make you leave the way in which the LORD your God commanded you to walk. So you shall purge the evil from your midst. (6) “If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son or your daughter or the wife you embrace or your friend who is as your own soul entices you secretly, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods,’ which neither you nor your fathers have known, (7) some of the gods of the peoples who are around you, whether near you or far off from you, from the one end of the earth to the other, (8) you shall not yield to him or listen to him, nor shall your eye pity him, nor shall you spare him, nor shall you conceal him. (9) But you shall kill him. Your hand shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. (10) You shall stone him to death with stones because he sought to draw you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. (11) And all Israel shall hear and fear and never again do any such wickedness as this among you. (12) “If you hear in one of your cities, which the LORD your God is giving you to dwell there, (13) that certain worthless fellows have gone out among you and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods,’ which you have not known, (14) then you shall inquire and make search and ask diligently. And behold, if it be true and certain that such an abomination has been done among you, (15) you shall surely put the inhabitants of that city to the sword, devoting it to destruction, all who are in it and its cattle, with the edge of the sword. (16) You shall gather all its spoil into the midst of its open square and burn the city and all its spoil with fire, as a whole burnt offering to the LORD your God. It shall be a heap forever. It shall not be built again. (17) None of the devoted things shall stick to your hand, that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger and show you mercy and have compassion on you and multiply you, as he swore to your fathers, (18) if you obey the voice of the LORD your God, keeping all his commandments that I am commanding you today, and doing what is right in the sight of the LORD your God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God demands exclusive loyalty. Those who mix in paganism will be judged swiftly and publicly.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note exceptions: usually, in the judgment section, there is the opportunity to &lt;strong&gt;repent&lt;/strong&gt;. Not here. A true believer would want to repent. At some point, salvation is about a believer being fed up with their sin and wanting to do things differently. When confronted with evil, he or she would answer a call to repentance. This is not what Jezebel (or a Jezebel type) does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They are throwing her into a sickbed&lt;/strong&gt;. This is likely used in the sense of Romans 1:26. Sometimes when a person has become so callous in his or her sin, the only thing God can do (usually after trying to get their attention in other ways) is to let them have at it in the hopes that they will hit rock bottom and repent. There was a scene where the children of Israel in the wilderness complained about the Manna, so God obliged. He sent them quail to eat. He sent them a lot of quail. So much that they gorged themselves and repented that they had asked for the quail, it&amp;rsquo;s the same with Jezebel. Whether the bed is literal or metaphoric, Jezebel has been using it for adultery, and now she&amp;rsquo;s going to be confined to it. This is the same sentiment as our English phrase, &amp;ldquo;you made your bed now lie in it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great trouble,&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;great tribulation&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s important to note there is no definite article in Greek. It is not THE great tribulation; it is just &amp;ldquo;great tribulation.&amp;rdquo; Θλιψιν μεγαλην. This literally means hardship that is grand in scope and does not directly denote a time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, scholars have pieced together the various &amp;ldquo;end times&amp;rdquo; passages and would say there is THE Great Tribulation that references a time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel 9 records a 70-year prophecy, where we presume a year is a week of years. There is a notable gap between the 69th and the 70th weeks. So the last week is equivalent to seven years. This is known by many names, including &amp;ldquo;the tribulation period, and &amp;ldquo;the time of Jacob&amp;rsquo;s trouble.&amp;rdquo; The seven years are further subdivided into two three-and-a-half-year periods. The first period is when Satan is spreading havoc on the earth. The second of these 3.5 year periods is God&amp;rsquo;s wrath. This is the period known as &amp;ldquo;The Great Tribulation.&amp;rdquo; The thought is people who don&amp;rsquo;t repent, if they are still living, will be cast into the Great Tribulation of God&amp;rsquo;s wrath poured out upon the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Searches&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;perceives&lt;/strong&gt; – the Greek implies a thorough investigation. Jesus reiterates that He is omniscient and sees all (in connection with verse 18).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children&lt;/strong&gt; – possibly natural illegitimate offspring, but more likely, &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo; means Jezebel&amp;rsquo;s disciples and the product or the result of this philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dead&lt;/strong&gt; – not just physical death, but given the context, the Second Death is also in view. This is the death reserved for unbelievers. For this is what those &lt;strong&gt;deeds deserve&lt;/strong&gt;. Deuteronomy 13 describes the punishment, and in 1 Kings 18, Elijah carries this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind and heart&lt;/strong&gt; – the Greek is nephrous kai kardias, which is a Hebrew idiom. Nephro, like nephrologist, pertains to the kidneys, and you probably recognize cardias from Cardiac, related to the heart. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit different than we think of in English, but Hebraiclly, the heart would be man&amp;rsquo;s conscious thoughts, the way we use the term &amp;ldquo;mind&amp;rdquo; in English. The kidneys, Hebraically, represent the subconsciousness: one&amp;rsquo;s deepest desires, closer to the way we would use &amp;ldquo;heart&amp;rdquo; in English. So &amp;ldquo;Mind and heart&amp;rdquo; is a fair translation of nephros and cardias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(24) But to the rest of you in Thyatira, to those who do not hold this teaching, who have not learned what some people call the &amp;lsquo;deep things&amp;rsquo; of the Adversary, I say this: I am not loading you up with another burden; &lt;br&gt;(25) only hold fast to what you have until I come.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Act 15:28-29 For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements: (29) that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.” 1Co 2:10 these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This teaching&lt;/strong&gt; – those who say they are going to feed their body digestively and sexually, however they want, regardless of what God&amp;rsquo;s word says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep things&lt;/strong&gt; – a tenet of Gnosticism is that they believed they had uncovered secret meaning. A plain reading of the Bible is not enough; one has to have the more profound knowledge that, conveniently, only they have. &amp;ldquo;Depths of Satan&amp;rdquo; is also fair. The teaching is satanic. Similar to &amp;ldquo;Jews who say they are not&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Synagogue of Satan,&amp;rdquo; this could also be a reversal. Jezebel is claiming to teach the more profound things of God, but Jesus said she is teaching the things of Satan. She could be misapplying 1 Corinthians and claiming that the Spirit taught her &amp;ldquo;deeper things of God.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve said it before, but we need to be very cautious with the phrase &amp;ldquo;I have freedom in Christ,&amp;rdquo; for this could be a teaching of Jezebel. Believers have standards and boundaries established by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another burden&lt;/strong&gt; seems to recall Acts 15:28 since this entire chapter, including Ephesus, Pergamum, and Thyatira, appears to be alluding to the Acts 15 council and four additional restrictions placed on the Gentile followers of Israel&amp;rsquo;s God and Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a possible pun here in Greek. The word for &amp;ldquo;deep things&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;bathos,&amp;rdquo; and the word for burden is &amp;ldquo;baros.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Until I come:&lt;/strong&gt; this is the first of the seven letters that have an explicit promise of His return, and it is expressed in each of the last four letters. From an application perspective, this is the proof from the Bible we need to interpret these letters as going beyond the original first-century context. We can&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;go there&amp;rdquo; on our own and come up with an interpretation that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have made sense to the original audience, but if the Bible itself makes it clear, then we can proceed, albeit with extreme caution. Jesus did not return to the Church of Thyatira or anywhere else in the first century. Therefore we know that some aspect of the letter to Thyatira is yet future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Rev 2:26-29 To him who wins the victory and does what I want until the goal is reached, I will give him authority over the nations;  &lt;br&gt;(27) he will rule them with a staff of iron and dash them to pieces like pottery,  &lt;br&gt;(28) just as I have received authority from my Father. I will also give him the morning star.  &lt;br&gt;(29) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.&amp;rdquo; &#39;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Psa 2:1-12 Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain? (2) The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and against his Anointed, saying, (3) “Let us burst their bonds apart and cast away their cords from us.” (4) He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord holds them in derision. (5) Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying, (6) “As for me, I have set my King on Zion, my holy hill.” (7) I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, “You are my Son; today I have begotten you. (8) Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession. (9) You shall break them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces like a potter&amp;rsquo;s vessel.” (10) Now therefore, O kings, be wise; be warned, O rulers of the earth. (11) Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. (12) Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the faithful and trustworthy overcomers, those who acknowledge God&amp;rsquo;s authority in this life, God will give tremendous authority in the kingdom. In Psalm 2, God the Father grants this authority to His Son. In Revelation 2, the Son delegates this authority to the Overcomers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Goyim versus Righteous Gentiles&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power over the nations was the goal of Jezebel, and for those who subscribe to the church age theory, it was also the goal of the Medieval Catholic Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might help to understand how a Jew sees the world. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple. There are Jews, and there are non-Jews. Non-Jews, i.e., gentiles, are called &amp;ldquo;goyim,&amp;rdquo; for nations. Goyim is the word used in Psalm 2:1. Traditionally and broadly, goyim are opposed to Jews and the God of Israel. In Matthew 18:17. The term &amp;ldquo;goyim&amp;rdquo; is generally used derisively on account of the historic mistreatment of Israel by the Nations since Egypt. In the Bible, Israel is set apart from the Nations, it is not one of the nations. We see a type of this in Genesis 11, which is the table of the Nations, and then Genesis 12 starts with the story of Abraham, who is called out of the nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an exception called &amp;ldquo;Righteous gentiles,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;righteous among the nations.&amp;rdquo; Specifically, these are the Europeans who risked their lives sheltering Jews from the Germans during the Holocaust. This is a formal title given by the state of Israel to such heroes. The term for &amp;ldquo;righteous gentile&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;ger toshav,&amp;rdquo; which we might translate as a resident alien, drawing from those in the Bible who attached themselves to the Israelites, or Chassid Umot ha-Olam, &amp;ldquo;Pious people of the world.&amp;rdquo; According to Judaism, a ger toshav is assured of a place in the world to come. What I find interesting is that neither expression uses the term &amp;ldquo;goyim.&amp;rdquo; As Gentile believers, I would say we are called out of being goyim, the kind of gentiles Jesus references in Matthew 18:17 who behave according to the teachings of the Nicolaitans, Balaam, and Jezebel. We are called to be Righteous Gentiles, grafted in and not trying to attain power over the nations. One of our rewards for this is being given the authority to judge the goyim in the age to come. This may not sound that thrilling but note that it is important enough to God that He mentions it several times, including Psalms 2 and here in the letter to Thyatira.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morning star&lt;/strong&gt;. Some commentators connect 2 Peter 1:19; however, a different Greek word is used in Revelation 2:28. Jesus states that He is the bring morning start in Revelation 22:16. Lizorkin references an apocryphal work, Sirach 50:5-7, and concludes the intended meaning is a &amp;ldquo;promise (to the overcomer) of a glorious future and great good yet to come. They will share it &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; Christ Himself.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Keener adds, &amp;ldquo;the morning star, Venus, heralded the dawn and was a symbol of sovereignty among the Romans. To be given authority was to share Christ&amp;rsquo;s rule over creation.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We focus on Jezebel because that certainly grabs our attention. It&amp;rsquo;s slightly cryptic, so we want to do our homework as best as possible and make sure we understand. However, the critical verses for Believers are not necessarily 20-29, but verse 19. If we want to please our Master, we need to exhibit good deeds and be known for our love, faith, service, patient endurance. Further, no matter how well we may be doing these things today, there will be another opportunity to do better tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toleration is the world&amp;rsquo;s philosophy, not God&amp;rsquo;s. We need to remember Galatians 1:8: But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck Missler paraphrased the famous expression (probably incorrectly) attributed to St. Augustine: &amp;ldquo;In essentials, unity; in non-essentials, liberty; in all things, agape.&amp;rdquo; We need to hold fast to the truth of God&amp;rsquo;s word and never allow it to be mixed in with non-biblical philosophies. We must always do so in love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;church-age-theory-thyatiraroman-church&#34;&gt;Church age theory: Thyatira=Roman Church&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/599819d1749ed236d0f257e50963e0c9.png&#34; cap=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the promise to hold until He returns that occurs in the last for letters, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea are seen all in existence today. The statement that &amp;ldquo;he who has an ear&amp;rdquo; is now after the promise to the overcomer also hints that there is something different about the last four compared to the first three churches. There is another variation that would hold that All seven churches have always been present, but one type of church has dominated in its given time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first universal pope was named in 606, so that is the date many commentators list as the start of the Thyatirian church age. Essentially this is the medieval church, which as we know was dominated by the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Missler says, &amp;ldquo;Protestant commentators have a field day linking Thyatira to the Catholic Church.&amp;rdquo; The history of the Catholic church has been bloody, and several Popes have been some of the most corrupt and morally depraved world leaders that history has ever witnessed &amp;ndash; much like Jezebel herself. Everything they did was all in the name of &amp;ldquo;Christ.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/b046f1d15cef93cacfc0f6c1c94e35d1.png&#34; cap=&#34;Denarius depicting Julius Caesar as pontifex maximum&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of the Catholic church has been bloody, and several Popes have been some of the most corrupt and morally depraved world leaders history has ever witnessed. Critics see the worship of Mary as a connection to the pagan &amp;ldquo;queen of heaven&amp;rdquo; that started back in the Babylonian days. The Pope is known as &amp;ldquo;Pontifex Maximus&amp;rdquo;, which were titles deified emperors such as Augustus in the Roman Cult. To be fair, in the Greek Old Testament, the equivalent term is used to describe the Jewish High Priest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/37ad82b2168894efb65d6f1751c64575.jpg&#34; cap=&#34;Statue of Peter at Capernaum&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protestants would say there is also a lack of biblical support for Peter as the first pope. There is no historical evidence that Peter was ever a Bishop of Rome and Peter&amp;rsquo;s own words counter any such political office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Pe 5:1-3 So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the glory that is going to be revealed: (2) shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you; not for shameful gain, but eagerly; (3) not domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler notes that there was a Babylonian priest &amp;ldquo;who interpreted the esoteric doctrines of the Babylonian mysteries called Peter, meaning the interpreter. He wore an insignia of two keys of Janus and Cybele, which still appear on the Papal arms as symbols of spiritual authority.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:21&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Janus is where we get the name of the first month of the year. As we tend to do in January, he is depicted as having two heads (looking forward and looking back). In fairness, Catholics would say these represent the symbolic &amp;ldquo;keys to the kingdom&amp;rdquo; given to Peter at Caesarea Philippi. This photo was taken at Peter’s hometown in Capernaum. Bolen writes, &amp;ldquo;with the property now owned by the Franciscans, it is not surprising that they would honor this apostle with a statue showing him holding a key and a staff.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:22&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 21, 1995, the Pope asked forgiveness for all wrongs and crimes committed and permitted by the Catholic Church throughout history. Many Catholic leaders will have a lot to answer for, both historically and in our times today. But you know what? Regardless of their religious affiliation (or lack thereof), all people will have to answer for their decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this said, Catholics and Protestants need not be enemies. One of my very best friends is Catholic, and we&amp;rsquo;re both confident we&amp;rsquo;ll both be together in the age to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/edcc1ea14f5b0e9b312b1f39bc569811.jpeg&#34; cap=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is said that Secret Service agents are trained to spot counterfeit currency, not by studying all the possible iterations of fake bills, but by intimately studying a legitimate bill. Every fiber, every mark (seen and unseen), every dot. I&amp;rsquo;m told they spend hours handling the real thing so that when they come across a fake bill, it&amp;rsquo;s pronounced as night and day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked this as a lesson for believers. The best way to spot a Jezebel with counterfeit beliefs is not by devoting our lives to studying everything wrong with that particular system. Leave that work to historians. The best way to spot the results of a Jezebel is to be intimately familiar with the truth. The word of God. I want it to be said of me what Paul said in acts 20:27: &amp;ldquo;for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, Protestants can&amp;rsquo;t get too smug about Thyatira. The letter representing the Protestant Reformation is Sardis and Jesus had NOTHING good to say about Sardis. In contrast, Thyatira receives the longest positives of all seven letters. The Catholic Church has done much good for humanity over the centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;parables-thyatira--mustard-seed-mat-1333&#34;&gt;Parables: Thyatira = Mustard Seed (Mat 13:33)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mat 13:33 And he told them yet another parable. &amp;ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with a bushel of flour, then waited until the whole batch of dough rose.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaven
:Usually, though not always, it represents sin or evil. &lt;strong&gt;1 Co 5:6&lt;/strong&gt; Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bushel/three measures of flour
:From Genesis 18:6, a fellowship meal, by extension the grain offering. According to Leviticus 2, grain offerings are supposed to be unleavened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till all was leavened
:The leaven corrupted the whole batch, which was supposed to remain unleavened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Meaning&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;In the Mustard Seed parable, the birds of the air nested, representing an external threat. The corruption came from within the dough itself in the Woman with Leaven. Missler finds it conspicuous that this is the only one of the seven parables that mentions a woman, and the letter to Thyatira also is the only one that mentions a woman. Jezebel was an internal threat that introduced corruption.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;paul-thyatiragalatians&#34;&gt;Paul: Thyatira=Galatians&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thyatira was the church that mixed the woman&amp;rsquo;s leaven, Jezebel&amp;rsquo;s false and pagan practices, with the true gospel. Paul admonishes the Galatians for the same things in the letter to the Galatians. He also uses the term &amp;ldquo;leaven&amp;rdquo; to describe this phenomenon in Galatians 5:9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some misconceptions arise when we fail to read Galatians as a Jewish book. Paul was a Jew writing to a predominately Jewish congregation, which had just begun to have Gentiles come to faith. If we read it as a gentile author writing to Gentile believers, we can get the impression that Paul is anti-Jewish. God forbid!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important to remember what legalism is and is not. Legalism is the doing of good deeds to merit salvation from God. A Judaizer says that a gentile must convert to and follow the Jewish law to earn salvation from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very different from doing good deeds as a thank you back to God. We can use the example of Messianic Jews. I have another good friend who absolutely knows he is saved by faith in Yeshua. Yet because he is Jewish, he observes Shabbat, keeps kosher, and observes the Jewish holidays instead of the Christian ones. He is not being legalistic. This is not being a Judaizer. In contrast, certain churches (Catholic as well as protestant) teach that believing in Jesus is not enough. One needs to do other things to get saved. This is what Galatians is focusing on, as Stern says, &amp;ldquo;the perversion of the Torah into a legalistic system.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:23&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:23&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
Gal 1:6-10 I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel— (7) not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. (8) But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. (9) As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed. (10) For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ.
&lt;p&gt;Gal 2:16 yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gal 3:1-3 O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified. (2) Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith? (3) Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gal 3:11 Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for “The righteous shall live by faith.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gal 5:9 A little leaven leavens the whole lump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gal 5:19-25 Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, (20) idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, (21) envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. (22) But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, (23) gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. (24) And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. (25) If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(1) &amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Sardis, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the one who has the sevenfold Spirit of God and the seven stars: &amp;ldquo;I know what you are doing—you have a reputation for being alive, but in fact you are dead!  (2) Wake up, and strengthen what remains, before it dies too! For I have found what you are doing incomplete in the sight of my God.  (3) So remember what you received and heard, and obey it, and turn from your sin! For if you don&amp;rsquo;t wake up, I will come like a thief; and you don&amp;rsquo;t know at what moment I will come upon you.  (4) Nevertheless, you do have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes; and they will walk with me, clothed in white, because they are worthy.  (5) He who wins the victory will, like them, be dressed in white clothing; and I will not blot his name out of the Book of Life; in fact, I will acknowledge him individually before my Father and before his angels.  (6) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.&amp;rdquo; &#39;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sardis is about 17 miles south of Thyatira and 60 miles east of Smyrna.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founding of Sardis likely dates to before the time of Abraham (c 2000 BCE). It was the ancient capital of the Lydian empire. Its patron deity was the Goddess Cybele, which in Greco-Roman times became Artemis/Diana, who was also the patron deity of Ephesus. Cybele&amp;rsquo;s son was Midas, whom we may know as the one where everything he touched turned to gold. This is a great lesson in the need to think things through. Everything he touched, included things such as food. Before the Greek period, Sardis was rumored to have &amp;ldquo;gold-bearing sands.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Historically, it was an extremely wealthy city all the way through New Testament times.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;img src=&#34;images/f19e90f43b6db3fa14d444c2d16c7b40.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temple to Diana was the fourth largest Ionic-style temple existing in the ancient world.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There were eight massive columns on each end with 20 columns on each side. One of these columns is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. For scale, note the people on the ground in the photo.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; At one point, prior to it being excavated by archaeologists, the entire temple was underground, with just the columns sticking up out of the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/c099e2a7ce04345047ade1d97b1b57e9.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Pergamum, ancient Sardis sat atop a hill rising 1000 feet from the valley below.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; By appearances, it was impregnable. Geologically, the cliffs were predominately clay, which cracked and eroded. Egotistically, the citizens referred to their city as &amp;ldquo;Sardis the Impregnable,&amp;rdquo; so did little to guard.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; One tradition holds that in 549 BCE, Cyrus was approaching with his Persian army. Only one person was designated to watch the one entrance up the cliff and that person fell asleep and dropped his helmet partway down the cliff. The Persians saw the man and the path he took were able to follow that same path to victory. Then in 214 BCE, a nearly identical thing happened. A man was asleep at his post, this time allowing Antiochus I and his Seleucid Greeks to take over. The city was conquered three other times during that period (501, 334, and 322). In the New Testament times, the city was devastated by a severe earthquake in 17 CE. We could say that they had a name that they were impenetrable but were very much vulnerable. Jesus appears to be drawing on this history when He says, &amp;ldquo;wake up!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;burial-place-of-gog&#34;&gt;Burial place of Gog?&lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;img src=&#34;images/a4603cdc9c4d9950a7c830d14c79cd2d.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Sardis tumulus, tb041505694&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight miles north of Sardis are dozens of these burial mounds (called tumulus) dating from the 8th-6th centuries BCE. This is the mound of Gyges, the first king of Lydia (687-652 BCE), thought by many to be the biblical Gog from Ezekiel 39-39&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We will meet Gog again in Revelation 20:8. &amp;ldquo;and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Thyatira, archeologists have been able to uncover many findings at Sardis. Most date from the 2nd century through the Byzantine period. Stiles reports that along a street where 27 shops have been excavated, 10 of these belonged to Christians, clearly indicating integration into mainstream society. This is in remarkable contrast to the previous four cities we have studied, where persecution was expected. The photo shows what archaeologists believe to be a paint shop. The slabs with the crosses inscribed was a water basin.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a large, well-preserved Jewish synagogue that could accommodate 1000 people. This attests to a significant Jewish/Christian population. Bolen writes, &amp;ldquo;The approximately eighty inscriptions found…reveal that many Jews held high positions, serving on the city council or as wealthy citizens of Sardis.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 100 years earlier, Sardis was one of the first cities in the Empire that upheld the rights of Jews to be exempt from Emperor worship, so it appears the Jews held special favor here. For Gentiles, such worship was enforced here as it was everywhere in the Empire, yet as we saw, gentile Christians appear to have been as integrated into Sardis&amp;rsquo;s society just as much as Jews were, and both groups were prosperous. Given this background, one of the dangers the letter to Sardis represents is apathy stemming from wealth and comfort. Keener states, &amp;ldquo;Despite the city&amp;rsquo;s paganism, the Christian community seems to have experienced no persecution—and hence no spiritual life.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do have one bit of potentially good news to report on Sardis from a spiritual perspective. There is a large basilica that was built right next to the temple of Artemis, as a testament that the gospel outlasted the false gods of Rome.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Wayne stiles notes, &amp;ldquo;The ruins of this Christian building offer a model of hope of the Grace of God to all Christians who are struggling with compromise.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Bolen adds, &amp;ldquo;Sardis remained a center of Christianity well into the 14th century.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As Jesus will tell the Laodiceans, &amp;ldquo;Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline, so be zealous and repent&amp;rdquo; (Rev 3:19). Perhaps the longevity of the Church in Sardis is evidence that the believers there heeded Jesus&amp;rsquo; warnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(1) &amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Sardis, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the one who has the sevenfold Spirit of God and the seven stars:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Joh 15:26-27 “But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me. (27) And you also will bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.  &lt;br&gt;1Pe 1:10-12 Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired carefully, (11) inquiring what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories. (12) It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you, in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look. &lt;br&gt; Zechariah 4:6 Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the LORD of hosts.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Thyatira, Sardis&amp;rsquo;s meaning is well known. We may be familiar with the &amp;ldquo;sardius stone.&amp;rdquo; This is what Sardis means. It is a reddish-yellow stone, which was the 1st stone on the 1st row of the breastplate of the high priest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus&amp;rsquo; description of himself (and remember the text does not directly tell us Jesus is talking; we infer it) is taken from chapter 1:20. He&amp;rsquo;s holding all the churches in his hand. Missler, who is a proponent of the church age theory sees a deeper connection. In this theory, Sardis speaks of the Protestant Reformation. Most Protestant churches tend to be uncomfortable with the Holy Spirit. We know He is there, but if we were asked to write a description of the duties of the spirit, most of us wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have much beyond &amp;ldquo;helper&amp;rdquo; (John 15:26). In fact, the topic of the Spirit is a cause of major division among Protestants. Conversely, there are some denominations who emphasize the spirit, perhaps to an excess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;zechariah-41-10&#34;&gt;Zechariah 4:1-10&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book of Zechariah, the prophet receives several visions, including the one in Chapter 4 about the rebuilding of the 2nd temple, which is often called &amp;ldquo;Zerubbabel&amp;rsquo;s temple.&amp;rdquo; Zerubbabel was the heir to the Davidic throne and served as governor of Judah under the Persian king Darius I. He was not truly a king but more of an administrator. Many people assume that the Davidic line was broken at the time of the Babylonian captivity. They would be correct in the sense of that&amp;rsquo;s when the Davidic kingship ended. Technically, the Davidic line continued upon the people&amp;rsquo;s return, albeit in a weakened state, after the Babylonian captivity. Based on passages like Zechariah 4, some assumed Zerubbabel would be the promised Messiah. This obviously was not to be, and the Davidic line &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; stop with Zerubbabel as the next administrator after him was not of the royal line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Zechariah 4:1-10: And the angel who talked with me came again and woke me, like a man who is awakened out of his sleep. (2) And he said to me, “What do you see?” I said, “I see, and behold, a &lt;strong&gt;lampstand all of gold, with a bowl&lt;/strong&gt; on the top of it, and &lt;strong&gt;seven lamps&lt;/strong&gt; on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it. (3) And there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.” (4) And I said to the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” (5) Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, “Do you not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.” (6) Then he said to me, “This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: &lt;strong&gt;Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the LORD of hosts&lt;/strong&gt;. (7) Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain. And he shall bring forward the top stone amid shouts of ‘Grace, grace to it!’” (8) Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, (9) “The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also complete it. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. (10) For whoever has despised the day of small things shall rejoice, and shall see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. “&lt;strong&gt;These seven are the eyes of the LORD&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;which range through the whole earth&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll definitely have more to say about this passage as we progress through Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/99182ebc8b48e3cf451a1c910c04df16.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever specifically was wrong with Sardis it is, of course, no accident that the Author of these letters in Revelation (who for simplicity we&amp;rsquo;ll call Jesus) describes Himself as the one with the Sevenfold Spirit. Perhaps the people of Sardis were resting in their own accomplishments and had no use for the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know from Chapter 1, Jesus&#39; description has a connection to the Temple Menorah. The photo is from Jerusalem at the government building called the Knesset. At the Knesset, there is a large Menorah that has 29 separate reliefs showing the History of Israel, with Jacob and Rachael, to Moses, all the way to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. Along the outer branches, reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;לא בחיל ולא בכח כי אם־ברוחי אמר יי צבאות&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zechariah 4:6: &amp;ldquo;not by might, nor by power but by my Spirit says Adonai Tzavaot.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is reminding Sardis of this verse. Perhaps they were being fooled into thinking they had things under control in their own strength. We run this risk as well. Zechariah 4:6 is an important verse for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;no-positives&#34;&gt;No positives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some commentators view &amp;ldquo;you have a name for being alive&amp;rdquo; as the positive. I suggest this statement is at all a positive because what good is having a good reputation if it&amp;rsquo;s not really true under the surface? &amp;ldquo;You have a name for being alive&amp;rdquo; might be what we would call a backhanded compliment. Jesus knows that the so-called accolade is empty because it&amp;rsquo;s not really true under the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I recommend the entire sentence, &amp;ldquo;I know what you are doing—you have a reputation/name for being alive, but in fact, you are dead&amp;rdquo; as the complete statement of judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;judgment&#34;&gt;Judgment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(1) &amp;ldquo;I know what you are doing—you have a reputation for being alive, but in fact you are dead!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 Sa 16:7 But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the LORD sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.”  &lt;br&gt;Pro 21:2 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but the LORD weighs the heart. &lt;br&gt;Deu 12:8 “You shall not do according to all that we are doing here today, everyone doing whatever is right in his own eyes, &lt;br&gt;Jdg 17:6 In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the harshest criticism yet leveled at any of the cities and is only surpassed by Laodicea, the 7th and final letter. It is fitting that Laodicea and Sardis are the only two cities of the seven that are uninhabited today.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name/Reputation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the Hebrew word שֵׁם, the Greek word ονομα (onoma) means not only your legal name but also your reputation. One can have a good name or a bad name. In Sardis&#39; case, they appear to outsiders that they have it all together but deep down they were being hypocritical. Lizorkin speculates that, unlike the other churches we have studied, the believers in Sardis may have been wealthy. It is still true today that many people believe material wealth indicates blessing from God. We can conclude that the believers in Sardis were self-deceived. Perhaps these good deeds were financial gifts to others, for which the donors took pride. &amp;ldquo;They may have been behind much of the funding that the first-century followers of Jesus distributed to those in need.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus doesn&amp;rsquo;t just say they are sickly and need to get better; He says they are &amp;ldquo;dead.&amp;rdquo; We can imagine that the people of Sardis believed themselves spiritually impregnable and put on a façade. They didn&amp;rsquo;t know that Jesus who is amidst the churches was not fooled. He knows they are dead. There is good and bad news associated with this statement. The bad news is that if you are dead, there is nothing you can do to change your situation. The good news is that it helps to know someone who can do something about your situation. Jesus is in the resurrection business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/bd3c3cecf327b2b447b1b2759eabac38.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of verses in the Old Testament and New Testaments that speak to the fact that God knows a man&amp;rsquo;s thoughts and expects inward purity, not just an outward pretense. We will look at a few of these below, but one example is 1 Samuel 16:7, where the prophet Samuel is seeking David. His father Jesse, doesn&amp;rsquo;t even bother bringing David out. He&amp;rsquo;s the youngest, and perhaps not as outwardly impressive as his older brothers. Samuel responds with the famous quote, &amp;ldquo;the LORD sees not as man sees. Man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/b489dafd2dbf3f0581233e1cd064a338.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related to this is the concept of doing what is right in our own eyes. We see this prohibited in Deuteronomy yet acted out repeatedly in the book of Judges. If we are not anchored to the King, we are apt to wander. When we wander, we can think we are on the right path, but actually, be hopelessly lost. Samson is a perfect example of this. He was called to be set apart for God, even taking a Nazirite vow to abstain from things that were otherwise permitted. In the same way, we might give something up for Lent today. It&amp;rsquo;s a form of self-affliction or fast meant to draw us closer to God. Samson rejected all this in favor of doing whatever pleased him at the moment, all the while thinking he was right with God.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(2) Wake up, and strengthen what remains, before it dies too! For I have found what you are doing incomplete in the sight of my God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Joh 11:11 After saying these things, he said to them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him.”  &lt;br&gt; Mar 14:38 Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”  &lt;br&gt;Jas 1:22-24 But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. (23) For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. (24) For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wake up and strengthen!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/aa949def2af0b3d4729891fe707e3601.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebraic thought, to say that one &amp;ldquo;sleeps&amp;rdquo; could also denote death. Jesus saying, &amp;ldquo;wake up,&amp;rdquo; could be akin to calling a dead Lazarus from the grave (and like Lazarus, apparently this church also &amp;ldquo;stinketh&amp;rdquo;). This is also the same Greek word He used in Mark 14:38 in the Garden of Gethsemane after he came upon the disciples literally sleeping.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If you know anyone named &amp;ldquo;Greg&amp;rdquo;, the name comes from this Greek word for watchful or vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either case, He&amp;rsquo;s calling this church to get up. The work isn&amp;rsquo;t finished yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, with Sardis military history, they were literally asleep when they should have been keeping watch for enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incomplete&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We mentioned previously that gentiles were still subject to the annual emperor worship requirement. We&amp;rsquo;re speculating but perhaps their wealth curried favor with the Roman leadership. Were they able to buy their way out of the requirement? If so, the hypocrisy could involve the same types of mixing and corruption we saw in Pergamum and Thyatira. Jesus demands purity. Stern also notes that a hypocrite is also one whose doctrine may be exactly spot on, but otherwise live with a lack of faith and produce no fruit.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Perhaps the believers in Sardis were missing Jesus by 18&amp;rdquo; (the distance from the head to the heart). Hence, this could be one application of &amp;ldquo;Incomplete in the sight of God.&amp;rdquo; They were mixed every bit as much as Pergamum and Thyatira were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another speculation is that they had fled serious study of God&amp;rsquo;s Word (which, remember in the first century was the Old Testament only), in view of man-made doctrines and activities. At best, like James 1:22 says, they were hearers only, not doers. Sardis could speak of the church that has a Statement of Faith that no one could argue with but inside, replaces doing God&amp;rsquo;s word with other religious activity that everyone assumes must be pleasing to God. James continues to say that such a person or such a church is not anchored in the reality of Scripture, or worse, they customize their own version of Scripture, which may be in direct conflict with what is actually written. &amp;ldquo;Not knowing Holy Scripture means we cannot know God&amp;rsquo;s will for us. And if we do not know God&amp;rsquo;s will, then we cannot do God&amp;rsquo;s will.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:21&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(3) So remember what you received and heard, and obey it, and turn from your sin! For if you don&amp;rsquo;t wake up, I will come like a thief; and you don&amp;rsquo;t know at what moment I will come upon you.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deu 6:3-9 Hear therefore, O Israel, and be careful to do them, that it may go well with you, and that you may multiply greatly, as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.  (4) “Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.  (5) You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.  (6) And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart.  (7) You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.  (8) You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.  (9) You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.  &lt;br&gt;Mat 24:42-43 So stay alert, because you don&amp;rsquo;t know on what day your Lord will come. (43) But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into.   &lt;br&gt;1Th 5:2 because you yourselves well know that the Day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.   &lt;br&gt;Rev 16:14-16 For they are demonic spirits, performing signs, who go abroad to the kings of the whole world, to assemble them for battle on the great day of God the Almighty. (15) (“Behold, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake, keeping his garments on, that he may not go about naked and be seen exposed!”) (16) And they assembled them at the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember what you received and heard, and obey!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There could be any number of things Jesus was referring to when He said, &amp;ldquo;remember what you received and heard, and obey.&amp;rdquo; Considering the enforced pagan worship, Lizorkin speculates that a logical assumption is the great Shema, in Deuteronomy 6:4 and following. This is the oath of allegiance to which the Apostle John would have followed and would have taught his Jewish and Gentile believers to follow. Again, the Shema speaks to the purity of worship God expects. Lizorkin writes, &amp;ldquo;Israel&amp;rsquo;s God alone must be worshipped. For His worshippers, there can be no other Gods.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:22&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In terms of what Jesus expected them to repent and turn towards, we need simply look back at Thyatira and remind ourselves of that great list of positives they received: Love, trust, service, and perseverance, and their last works were better than the first. The image says &amp;ldquo;Shema Israel&amp;rdquo; and is inscribed on the beautiful menorah at the Israeli Knesset. The Knesset is the &amp;ldquo;capitol hill&amp;rdquo; of Israel. The menorah depicts Israel&amp;rsquo;s Biblical and modern history in a series of reliefs.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:23&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:23&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the existence of the physical church in Sardis through the 14th century is evidence that they heeded Jesus&#39; words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repent or I will come as a thief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stern judgment is, fortunately, accompanied by a call to repent and be resurrected. For those who fail to heed that call, He will return for the final judgment exactly like a thief strikes. More good news: He evidently does NOT come as a thief for those who repent. Coming as a &amp;ldquo;thief in the night&amp;rdquo; was the repeated downfall of Sardis. Sardis&#39; acropolis was never taken by enemy force so much as it was yielded by apathy and inattention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus told MANY parables expressing this sentiment of being watchful and staying on task. We can broadly label them &amp;ldquo;man goes on a journey&amp;rdquo; parables. There are several variations (study Gospel Backgrounds with us to learn more!), but essentially, a man with wealth needs to go on a journey. He leaves a few of his hired hands or family members in charge of the business. He then returns unexpectedly and demands an immediate audit of the books. Depending on the parable, there are two groups: one group slacked off and did nothing, while the other was focused on the task. The former group is punished while those who grew the business were rewarded. The parable of the 10 Virgins in Matthew 25 is another variation on this theme. The groom goes away and returns unexpectedly. Five virgins are ready while the other five were not ready. Jesus will revisit the thief imagery in Revelation 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thief in the night vs thief in the day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Torah clearly promotes private property rights and prescribes penalties and remediation for theft or negligent loss of someone else&amp;rsquo;s property. The right of people to defend themselves and their property from harm or theft is also attested. Sometimes this results in the slaying of the would-be thief. Lancaster notes that there are two different classifications in the Torah depending on whether the act happened at night or during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exo 22:2-3 If a thief is found breaking in and is struck so that he dies, there shall be no bloodguilt for him, (3) but if the sun has risen on him, there shall be bloodguilt for him. He shall surely pay. If he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At night, the slaying of a thief is always assumed to be self-defense. The property owner has no way of knowing whether the thief is armed and dangerous. During daylight, the owner is expected to assess and grade the level of threat. Deadly force should only be used in the face of a deadly threat. In matters of excessive use of force, the property owner could be found guilty of murder if it was determined that he knew or should have known his life was not in immediate danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this relate to Yeshua saying, &amp;ldquo;I come as a thief?&amp;rdquo; During His first coming, Jesus was the &amp;ldquo;thief&amp;rdquo; metaphorically speaking who came in the daylight. He was murdered based on trumped-up charges and false accusations. His life was taken without proper diligence. This act resulted in blindness and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During His second coming, as he states repeatedly, He will come as a thief in the night. Unsuspecting people will not be ready. This is not to say Jesus is a thief worthy of death. Many times in the Gospels, He compares Himself or God the Father to all sorts of disagreeable characters (including a grumpy neighbor who reluctantly opens the door and a dishonest bookkeeper who fraudulently reduces his master&amp;rsquo;s receivables) to make a point. If imperfect people do a certain thing, how much more will a perfect God make things right. If a dishonest thief comes at night and surprises the unsuspecting, how much more will the son of Man come in righteous judgment when the unsuspecting are not prepared (Mark 24:43).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(4) Nevertheless, you do have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes; and they will walk with me, clothed in white, because they are worthy.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 61:10 I will greatly rejoice in the LORD; my soul shall exult in my God, for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation; he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest with a beautiful headdress, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.  &lt;br&gt;Rev 19:8 it was granted her to clothe herself with fine linen, bright and pure”— for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.  Ecc 9:8 Let your garments be always white. Let not oil be lacking on your head.   &lt;br&gt;Isa_61:10 I will greatly rejoice in the LORD; my soul shall exult in my God, for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation; he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest with a beautiful headdress, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. &lt;br&gt;Mat 23:27 “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people&amp;rsquo;s bones and all uncleanness.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/c322a130ed27148ce4334692c765ed74.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Sardis shepherd with his sheep, tb n010700&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence indicates that Sardis was known for its luxury textile and clothing trade, perhaps providing a local backdrop for verse 4.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:24&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:24&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Themes of purity recur throughout the book of Revelation, which is symbolized by white clothing. The believers in Sardis may have thought they were wearing white, and may have appeared to others that they were wearing white, but to Jesus&#39; eyes, they were soiled. Culturally, white robes were also worn by priests and sometimes worshippers of pagan deities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/5a6c1cb2f6efc2e3ba094ae0bceb26e2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus had a lot to say about pretentious external religiosity. In Matthew 23:27, Jesus states “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people&amp;rsquo;s bones and all uncleanness.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:25&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:25&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; During the days leading up to Jewish feasts where ritual purity was commanded, volunteers would mark gravesites with white paint. This was done so that celebrants didn&amp;rsquo;t inadvertently come into contact and defile themselves. In context, the whitewash is actually calling attention to something unclean, so Jesus&#39; comparison is all the more stinging. Jesus knew their works, just like He knows our works. When we study the Gospels, it is helpful to put ourselves in the shoes of everyone Jesus interacts with. In other words, we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t point fingers at the scribes and the Pharisees. We should introspectively examine how you and I can be like whitewashed tombs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(5) He who wins the victory will, like them, be dressed in white clothing; and I will not blot his name out of the Book of Life; in fact, I will acknowledge him individually before my Father and before his angels.

&lt;td&gt;Exo 32:30-33 The next day Moses said to the people, “You have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.”  (31) So Moses returned to the LORD and said, “Alas, this people has sinned a great sin. They have made for themselves gods of gold.  (32) But now, if you will forgive their sin—but if not, please blot me out of your book that you have written.”  (33) But the LORD said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me, I will blot out of my book. &lt;br&gt;Psa 69:27-28 Add to them punishment upon punishment; may they have no acquittal from you.  (28) Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; let them not be enrolled among the righteous.  &lt;br&gt;Dan 12:1 “At that time shall arise Michael, the great prince who has charge of your people. And there shall be a time of trouble, such as never has been since there was a nation till that time. But at that time your people shall be delivered, everyone whose name shall be found written in the book.  &lt;br&gt;Mal 3:16 Then those who feared the LORD spoke with one another. The LORD paid attention and heard them, and a book of remembrance was written before him of those who feared the LORD and esteemed his name.  &lt;br&gt;Rev 20:12 And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done. Rev_20:15 And if anyone&amp;rsquo;s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.  &lt;br&gt;Rev 20:12 And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done. Rev_20:15 And if anyone&amp;rsquo;s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.  &lt;br&gt;Luk 12:8-9 “And I tell you, everyone who acknowledges me before men, the Son of Man also will acknowledge before the angels of God,  (9) but the one who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of God. Mat_26:75 And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” And he went out and wept bitterly. .&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancient cultures had official rolls to which citizens could be added or erased,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:26&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:26&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but likely more in view is the Jewish concept of the eternal book of life (see the Exodus, Daniel, and Malachi verses above). The Jewish holiday of Rosh HaShanah (also knows as the feast of trumpets, from Leviticus 23:24, which commands the shofar blown on this day) is literally the Jewish first of the year, i.e. new year&amp;rsquo;s day on the Hebrew calendar. This begins a 10-period day of intense reflection and f repentance, leading up to the most solemn day of the year, Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement (see Leviticus 16). On Rosh HaShana, Jews bless each other by saying, &amp;ldquo;may your name be inscribed in the book of life.&amp;rdquo; In other words, the Book of Life is an entirely Jewish concept. In Exodus 32, Moses is willing to take the place of the people so their names would not be blotted out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not blotting out one&amp;rsquo;s name can be problematic from an eternal security perspective. By a plain sense reading, for a name to be blotted out, it had to first be written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than debating that argument, we need to focus on what Jesus is saying to US personally. Do we think we are dressed in white when we may be soiled? Self-deception – thinking they were right with God when they really were not - is a recurring theme among the churches with judgments. Let us not be so smug as to think we are immune from this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Malachi, the criteria for inscription in the Book of Life is straightforward. Fear the Lord with awe-filled reverence, and honor His name by being a worthy ambassador and talmid/disciple.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:27&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:27&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I will acknowledge him&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/9671e74e8d0da4fad0e39e10fca87bc2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statue is at the Church of St. Peter in Gallicantu, south of the Old City in Jerusalem.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:28&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:28&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It depicts Peter with three of his accusers and Peter denying three times on the night Jesus was arrested. The Latin inscription at the base (Non novi illum) means “I do not know Him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all need to be thankful for Peter&amp;rsquo;s denial. At this location in Jerusalem, we remember that we ALL at some point in our lives have denied Him or otherwise have not represented Him in a way that is worthy of His sacrifice for us. So are all of us going to be denied by Jesus in Heaven? This is a scary proposition, but we have good news. We know from Peter&amp;rsquo;s experience that Luke 12:9 is not necessarily an absolute truth. The general rule is &amp;ldquo;deny Me and I&amp;rsquo;ll deny you,&amp;rdquo; but we have a blessed exception. For this, we travel to another location in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/0d4a01fc2e54cc77c42999c744ba42c3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;We travel to Tabgha in the Sea of Galilee, where we look at John 21 and Peter&amp;rsquo;s restoration. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:29&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:29&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus asks Peter three times, &amp;ldquo;do you love me&amp;rdquo;, one time for each denial. Jesus recommissions Peter&amp;rsquo;s apostleship. This restoration allows us to go back to Luke 12:9 and if our hearts are broken about those times we deny Him, and we repent, He will restore us just as He did Peter at Tabgha. We, therefore, escape the judgment of Luke 12:9 and Revelation. Conversely, if a person&amp;rsquo;s denial carries a nuance of willful unrepentance and defiance, it might be &amp;ldquo;game over.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the reasons, if not THE reason that makes Tabgha in Israel such a special place is that is where tradition tells us that Peter was restored in John 21. We call it &amp;ldquo;Restoration Beach.&amp;rdquo; When I really mess up and let Him down, I go to that beach in my mind and receive His forgiveness and restoration. In fact, this is the theme running through all seven promises to the overcomer. To be an overcomer, we repent of our sins and let Jesus restore us to living in His will instead of ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sardis is a problem. Unlike Ephesus, Pergamum, and Thyatira, there were zero outward signs at Sardis that anything was wrong. There was no eating of prohibited food, evidently not having wild sex parties, nor were they comingling with paganism. It&amp;rsquo;s clear the believers themselves thought they were right where God wanted them to be. They were deceived. This is a huge warning to us. Could we be similarly deceived? As we&amp;rsquo;ve noted previously, we must open our books for God&amp;rsquo;s inspection. One thing as an auditor you have to prepare for when delivering your findings is the fact that sometimes management will push back during your exit report. They will argue with you that your findings are not that bad and present rationales supporting their position. Often this means they have deceived themselves that things are ok when they really are not ok. In contrast, astute managers will take even the slightest ding on an audit report very seriously and fix what may be a small problem, so that it does not become a big one. Let us be like that second group. These Seven Letters show that it&amp;rsquo;s critically important that we see ourselves the way Jesus sees us. The letters also show that how we see ourselves is typically not reflective of the greater reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;church-age-sardis--protestant-reformation&#34;&gt;Church Age: Sardis = Protestant Reformation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek word for &amp;ldquo;name, reputation&amp;rdquo; is ονομα (&lt;em&gt;onoma)&lt;/em&gt; and the word &amp;ldquo;denomination&amp;rdquo; is linguistically related. Ονομα occurs three times in this brief letter. Protestants would view the Reformation as a tremendous force for good within the church as it corrected a number of errors and non-biblical corruptions. This also corresponded to the time frame where Guttenberg invented the movable type printing press (in 1455), which results in millions receiving and reading God&amp;rsquo;s Word for themselves. So why would a church like Sardis, where nothing positive is mentioned, be a fit for the Protestant age in the 16th and 17th centuries? There are several suggestions made by different commentators. Ultimately, it&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that the Church Age theory is not in the Bible, so it&amp;rsquo;s open to much speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler suggests two reasons. First, the reformation did nothing to correct amillennial theology and the error of interpreting passages symbolically that were meant to be interpreted literally. The letter to Sardis states explicitly that He is returning and they better be ready. But the church that doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe He is coming back will not be ready. In this respect, they are like the group of workers in the &amp;ldquo;man goes on journey&amp;rdquo; parables who did nothing to prepare for the Master&amp;rsquo;s return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/678a4ccf12a54b3c9af9e58d752bb58d.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the Reformation did nothing to correct replacement theology. Luther claimed to cite Romans, but Romans contains the passages that state in no uncertain terms that God is not done with Israel. In his earlier years, Luther appears to have been favorably disposed to Jews because he thought his teachings would lead them to recognize their messiah. When this failed, Luther published some wildly antisemitic papers, that Lutherans don&amp;rsquo;t like to talk about. The photo is what is called a &amp;ldquo;judensau&amp;rdquo; that depicts Jews doing unspeakable things with a pig. Of course, pigs are considered unclean animals to Jews. Like we said previously, Pork is not unclean food. To a Jew, pork is not food at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely a godly man such as Luther would have denounced this disgusting attack, let alone one that adorns a church building, right? Wrong! Here is what Luther proudly said, &amp;ldquo;Here on our church in Wittenberg a sow is sculpted in stone. Young pigs and Jews lie suckling under her. Behind the sow a rabbi is bent over the sow, lifting up her right leg, holding her tail high and looking intensely under her tail and into her Talmud, as though he were reading something acute or extraordinary.&amp;rdquo; God said to Abraham in Genesis 12 &amp;ldquo;I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse those who curse you.&amp;rdquo; I think Luther and other protestant anti-Semites are on the wrong side of that equation. Let US not be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korman adds that the error with both Pergamum and Thyatira was that they were state churches.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:30&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:30&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The Reformation did nothing to untangle this web. Formerly Catholic state churches now became Protestant state churches. Calvin essentially ran the City of Geneva. He was also virulently anti-Semitic and is recorded as executing people he did not agree with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned earlier, some proponents of various flavors of Protestantism seem more interested in winning an argument than in saving souls. Missler used to say that Christians are the only group he&amp;rsquo;s aware of who form their firing squads in circles. How do we think Jesus would react to this constant intellectual debating? My wife and I had an experience early in our marriage where a pastor from one branch of historic Protestantism proudly said &amp;ldquo;we aren&amp;rsquo;t in fellowship with them,&amp;rdquo; referring to another branch of that same denomination. This is not to say that we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t hold firm on positions of doctrine, particularly in modern times when many denominations are embracing anti-biblical positions. Yet at the same time, there is a definite lack of love, faith, service, and patient endurance with one another (Rev 2:19) that is palpably absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one joke first told in 1980s, that has earned the title &amp;ldquo;funniest religious joke of all time.&amp;rdquo; It is a funny, yet sad indictment of the Sardis church, and particularly the Protestant church in America:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I saw this guy on a bridge about to jump. I said, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t do it!&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;Nobody loves me.&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;God loves you. Do you believe in God?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said, &amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;Are you a Christian or a Jew?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;A Christian.&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;Me, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protestant or Catholic?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;Protestant.&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;Me, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What franchise?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;Baptist.&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;Me, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Northern Baptist or Southern Baptist?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;Northern Baptist.&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;Me, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Northern Conservative Baptist or Northern Liberal Baptist?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;Northern Conservative Baptist.&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;Me, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region, or Northern Conservative Baptist Eastern Region?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region.&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;Me, too!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region Council of 1879, or Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region Council of 1912?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region Council of 1912.&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;Die, heretic!&amp;rdquo; And I pushed him over.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:31&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:31&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;parables-sardis--treasure-in-the-field&#34;&gt;Parables: Sardis = Treasure in the field&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Matthew 13:44&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Meaning&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mat 13:44 “The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A double sense- We could say Sardis is the treasure for whom Jesus gave up everything, but we ALL are the treasure for whom Jesus gave everything. A second meaning is that Jesus is the treasure Sardis had taken and buried so that no one could find it. They had head knowledge, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t manifest into loving God exclusively. The strongest adherents to reformation theology often want to win arguments about this position or that position, instead of realizing that we are all sinners in need of saving.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;paul-sardis--romans&#34;&gt;Paul: Sardis = Romans&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luther cited Romans frequently - it&amp;rsquo;s the definitive statement on Christian doctrine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It also mentions &amp;ldquo;death&amp;rdquo; 24x and &amp;ldquo;dead&amp;rdquo; 16x - more than in any other book of Paul&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used both of Christ&amp;rsquo;s death and the unbeliever&amp;rsquo;s dead state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sardis shows it is possible to call oneself a believer and still be dead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Romans speaks to a right understanding of our position in Christ and towards each other, yet many of these were left undone by the Reformers
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Position of Israel - Romans 9-11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Position of Gentiles with respect to Israel -Romans 11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not judge other believers who may not think exactly as you do - Romans 14&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appeal to avoid divisions - Romans 16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we believe Sardis had a happy ending. Their church endured into the 14th century, well into the second Islamic period. This suggests that they took Jesus&#39; judgments seriously and claimed the promises in Romans 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rom 8:28-30 And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. (29) For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. (30) And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rom 8:37-39 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors (&amp;ldquo;overcomers&amp;rdquo;) through him who loved us. (38) For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, (39) nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Philadelphia, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message of HaKadosh, the True One, the one who has the key of David, who, if he opens something, no one else can shut it, and if he closes something, no one else can open it. (8) &amp;ldquo;I know what you are doing. Look, I have put in front of you an open door, and no one can shut it. I know that you have but little power, yet you have obeyed my message and have not disowned me. (9) Here, I will give you some from the synagogue of the Adversary, those who call themselves Jews but aren&amp;rsquo;t—on the contrary, they are lying—see, I will cause them to come and prostrate themselves at your feet, and they will know that I have loved you. (10) Because you did obey my message about persevering, I will keep you from the time of trial coming upon the whole world to put the people living on earth to the test. (11) I am coming soon; hold on to what you have so that no one will take away your crown. (12) I will make him who wins the victory a pillar in the Temple of my God, and he will never leave it. Also, I will write on him the name of my God and the name of my God&amp;rsquo;s city, the new Yerushalayim coming down out of heaven from my God, and my own new name. (13) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.&amp;rdquo; &#39;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ancient city of Philadelphia lies under the modern city of Alasehir, Turkey. The abundance of seismic activity tied with the city’s history has created a chaotic situation in relation to excavations. There have been few inscriptions found and almost no significant excavations have been attempted. The remains of the Byzantine Church of St. John the Theologian, built around AD 600, are the most substantial archaeological remains currently visible.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Massive pillars suggest the 6th-century church was enormous.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Archaeologists have also found evidence of a stadium, only a part of which is visible today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphia is about 25-30 miles southeast of Sardis; it had the nickname &amp;ldquo;Gateway to the East&amp;rdquo; because of its access to trade routes, including commanding a junction on a Roman Road between Laidocea and Pergamum.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Through Philadelphia, &amp;ldquo;Hellenization&amp;rdquo; spread to the east. Hellenism sought to apply Greek manners and customs, first voluntarily, then forced. Missler sees this Hellenistic &amp;ldquo;missionary&amp;rdquo; activity as support for Philadelphia being a type of the missionary church age (1750-present).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eumenes II, king of Pergamum, had a younger brother Attalus II, who reigned from 159-138 BC. The name means “lover of his brother” and refers to Attalus’s loyalty to his brother in refusing to overthrow him, even amidst encouragement from advisors to do so.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In the same way, we believe the assembly of brothers and sisters in Philadelphia held fast in their loyalty to Jesus in the face of opposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Sardis, possibly the oldest city among the seven, Philadelphia is the newest. The city&amp;rsquo;s growth was impeded by frequent earthquakes, including those in 17 CE that severely damaged Sardis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A possible local allusion in the Letter to Philadelphia is that the city&amp;rsquo;s name was changed twice in the 1st century. At one point, it was named Neo Caesarea after emperor Tiberius, and then to Flavia Philadelphia, after the wife of Vespasian.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Philadelphia is the name that stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All cities of this time would have had enforced pagan worship. Zeus Helios and Anaitis, a person God related to Cybele and later, Artemis, were the patron deities. Temples and coins also featured Zeus, Dionysus, Aphrodite, Asclepius, Cybele, and Nike.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Wilson states enforcement of the required Roman oath may have been especially strict here.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Dionysus was an essential deity as grape production was an important industry. See the vineyards in the photo.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ldquo;Many religious festivals were held at the temple to Dionysus.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As a biblical type, wine is symbolic of marriage and celebration (cf. the Wedding at Cana), and by extension the Messianic Kingdom, also known as the marriage supper of the Lamb. There is a possible allusion to the vineyards of Philadelphia as being the church that will be ushered into the kingdom in the Age to Come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphia is not attested to elsewhere in the New Testament. No remains of a synagogue have been found. Still, there was an inscription referencing a &amp;ldquo;synagogue of the Hebrews,&amp;rdquo; and the legs of a table had menorahs and the four species of Sukkot (aka the Feast of Tabernacles) carved. Church tradition records that John appointed Demetrius as the city&amp;rsquo;s first Bishop. Eleven Christians from Philadelphia were martyred with Polycarp in Smyrna around 156, which is interesting given the cities&amp;rsquo; connection as the only two churches of the seven that had no condemnation. Like Sardis, the Church at Philadelphia held out until the 14th century, including withstanding sieges by the Turkish armies on two occasions. They held fast until about 1390, when they were finally driven out by the Islamic Ottoman Turks. There are a few Christian assemblies there today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Lev 19:2 “Speak to all the congregation of the people of Israel and say to them, You shall be holy, &lt;strong&gt;for I the LORD your God am holy&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;br&gt;Isa 47:4 Our Redeemer—the LORD of hosts is his name— is the &lt;strong&gt;Holy One of Israel&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joh 14:6&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and &lt;strong&gt;the truth&lt;/strong&gt;, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.  &lt;br&gt;1 Jn 5:20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may &lt;strong&gt;know him who is true&lt;/strong&gt;; and we are &lt;strong&gt;in him who is true&lt;/strong&gt;, in his Son Jesus Christ**. He is the true God and eternal life**.  &lt;br&gt;Isa 22:20-22 In that day I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, (21) and I will clothe him with your robe, and will bind your sash on him, and will commit your authority to his hand. And he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. (22) And I will place on his shoulder the &lt;strong&gt;key of the house of David&lt;/strong&gt;. He shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open. &lt;br&gt;Luk 1:31-35 And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. (32) He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the &lt;strong&gt;throne of his father David,&lt;/strong&gt; (33) and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom, there will be no end.” And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be since I am a virgin?” (35) And the angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called &lt;strong&gt;holy&lt;/strong&gt;—the Son of God. &lt;br&gt;Mat 16:19 I will give you the &lt;strong&gt;keys of the kingdom of heaven&lt;/strong&gt;, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”   &lt;br&gt;Act 15:15-18 And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written, (16) “‘After this, I will return, and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen; I will rebuild its ruins, and I will restore it, (17) that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles who are called by my name, says the Lord, who makes these things (18) known from of old.’ (Quoting Amos 9:11-12 and referencing Isaiah 16:5)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy One (as a show of respect, observant Jews will typically say, &amp;ldquo;the Holy One, blessed be He&amp;rdquo;) typically refers to God the Father, yet here it would seem to be speaking of Jesus. We can see many verses speak of God as Holy, or the Holy One, and True.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Isaiah 22, Eliakim was given the Key of David. Eliakim was a servant of Hezekiah. For Him to be given the Key of David meant that Eliakim had the authority to act with the full and legal authority of Hezekiah. In the same way, we can infer that the Father gave the Key of David to Jesus, meaning Jesus acts on the Father&amp;rsquo;s full authority. Again we see an example of John 1. The Bible tells us Jesus is with God, meaning distinct from the Father, and Jesus is God, meaning inseparable. (John 1:1). We know that Jesus also shares these keys with Peter in Matthew 16:19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Tent of David&amp;rdquo; from Acts 15 may also be in view. Lizorkin explains, &amp;ldquo;The prophets of old imagined a time when the house of David would be open to all the nations of the earth. The ultimate Davidic servant of God would rule over them in justice and righteousness. The (open door) welcomes gentile followers of the Jewish Christ into the tent of David.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Boaz Michael from the ministry First Fruits of Zion has written a book on this subject called &amp;ldquo;The Tent of David: Healing the vision of the messianic gentile.&amp;rdquo; He describes the Tent of David as &amp;ldquo;the apostle&amp;rsquo;s dream of a unified expression of faith in which Jew and Gentile worship the God of Abraham together and serve Him in the redemption of the world.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Based on the reference in Acts 15, Michael argues that this was the goal for gentiles in the early church, but we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten off-track by erasing the Jewishness of Jesus from our faith. Interestingly, he says that Baptists and non-denominational evangelical churches (essentially Baptist churches without the title) are the closest among the protestant divisions to realize this vision.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars are divided on whether these represent the same keys as in Rev 1:18. If we take the words literally, these are not the same keys; however, either way, the keys refer to authority over eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;davidic-covenant&#34;&gt;Davidic Covenant&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;David,&amp;rdquo; in this context, typically refers to the House of David, i.e., the Davidic kingdom. Christians may miss the Jewishness of Gabriel&amp;rsquo;s prophecy to Mary in Luke 1. This refers to what we call the &amp;ldquo;Davidic Covenant&amp;rdquo; in 2 Samuel 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
2 Sa 7:8-16 Now, therefore, thus you shall say to my servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people Israel. (9) And I have been with you wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth. (10) And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and plant them, so that they may dwell in their place and be disturbed no more. And violent men shall no longer afflict them, as formerly, (11) since I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover, the LORD declares that the LORD will make you a house. (12) When your days are fulfilled, and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and establish his kingdom. (13) He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. (14) I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, I will discipline him with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men, (15) but my steadfast love will not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before you. (16) And your house and kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever.’”
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This passage is an excellent reminder of how difficult it can be for us to interpret unfulfilled prophecy. If we were living in 700 BCE, we would read this and say, &amp;ldquo;This is talking about the line of Solomon and his descendants, including our wonderful king Hezekiah. This line will go on forever.&amp;rdquo; If we lived in 550 BCE, we&amp;rsquo;d be in Babylon wondering what happened. Had God&amp;rsquo;s word failed? Had we sinned so bad we forced God to break his promise? If we&amp;rsquo;re followers of Jesus in the late 20s CE, we&amp;rsquo;re wondering if this Jesus will be our political king who restores the throne of David, which will then continue forever? Today, with our hindsight, we can see that there STILL is no earthly king of David ruling from Jerusalem, but we believe we can confidently say that Jesus, not Solomon, is the son of David whose kingdom will be established. He was not the political king they were expecting, but He will return and establish His earthly throne and reign for 1000 years and then on into eternity. As we move into Chapter 4 and beyond, we need to keep in mind that, just as with the people living in 700 or 550 BCE, we may not have the right lenses available to us to say with absolute certainty what a still-to-be fulfilled prophecy exactly means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note a vital aspect of this prophecy. It is &lt;strong&gt;unconditional&lt;/strong&gt;. God does not say, &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; you do certain things, &lt;strong&gt;then&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ll establish your throne.&amp;rdquo; God promises the throne. Period. This matters because there are Christian commentators who say Israel has forfeited this promise because of their national rejection of Jesus as the Messiah. The unconditional promises to Israel now are spiritually given to the church. This theology goes by the name of &amp;ldquo;Replacement Theology&amp;rdquo; because it is said that the Church replaces Israel. The problem is that anyone who believes in Replacement Theology is calling God a liar. There is no other way to say it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus literally returns, He will establish the literal Davidic Kingdom. This is called the &amp;ldquo;age to come,&amp;rdquo; and in that respect, it is a reference to eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these indeed &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the same keys as in Revelation 1, then we would say this is also a reference to eternal life. The keys to death and Hades mean our eventual graves are not our final resting places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(8) &amp;ldquo;I know what you are doing. Look, I have put in front of you an open door, and no one can shut it. I know that you have but little power, yet you have obeyed my message and have not disowned me.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 25:6-8 On this mountain the LORD of hosts will make for all peoples a feast of rich food, a feast of well-aged wine, of rich food full of marrow, of aged wine well refined. (7) And he will swallow up on this mountain the covering that is cast over all peoples, the veil that is spread over all nations. (8) He will swallow up death forever; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from all faces, and the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for the LORD has spoken. &lt;br&gt;Joh 10:7-9 So Jesus again said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. (8) All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. (9) I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. &lt;br&gt;1 Cor 16:8-9 But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, (9) for a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many adversaries. &lt;br&gt;2 Cor 2:12 When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, even though a door was opened for me in the Lord,   &lt;br&gt;Col 4:3 At the same time, pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ, on account of which I am in prison—   &lt;br&gt;2 Cor 12:10 For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.   &lt;br&gt;Joh 14:21 Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen believers in most of the other churches compromise in some way, likely referring to participating in the Roman Imperial cult and its government-mandated worship procedures. Just because persecution is not explicitly referenced in Philadelphia, history tells us that it most likely was occurring. This is something to consider for all of us who want to believe we are a part of the church of Philadelphia today (and possibly where the church-age theory becomes quite strained, as there was no significant persecution in the late 1700s). In contrast, Jesus tells them they have &amp;ldquo;little power,&amp;rdquo; meaning they likely were powerless to stop the persecution going on around them. Like Smyrna, Jesus tells them to hold fast to His message and His name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster believes that saying &amp;ldquo;open door&amp;rdquo; is not specifically a &amp;ldquo;door of opportunity&amp;rdquo; but specifically refers to the open door of our tombs.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He sees these as the same &amp;ldquo;Keys of death and hades&amp;rdquo; and believes Isaiah 22:22 also speaks of unlocking the key of the grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern evangelists view this as an &amp;ldquo;open door&amp;rdquo; to spreading the Gospel. This may not have been the meaning the original audience would have understood; however, this use of the word door is attested to in Paul&amp;rsquo;s letters to the Corinthians and the Colossians. The application is valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J. Vernon McGee, one of my favorite Bible teachers, pastored the Church of the Open Door in downtown Los Angeles. It had a huge &amp;ldquo;Jesus Saves&amp;rdquo; neon sign that used to be visible from the Harbor Freeway. When I was a kid in the 70s and early 80s, my family would go to Dodger games and, as an unbeliever, in rebellion to God, I used to roll my eyes whenever I saw this sign. Now I love God, love J. Vernon Mcgee but hate the Dodgers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are specific themes in the Bible that recur. There are about 100 verses in the Bible that mention door, depending on your translation. If you have a software program and have some time, pull up all the verses containing &amp;ldquo;door.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The allusion to the vineyards of Philadelphia may or may not have occurred to the local audience in this context. Still, all of Jesus&amp;rsquo; promises to the overcomers pertain to the fact that He grants them eternal life. We believe wine will be flowing at the Messianic Banquet. In Mark 14:25, Jesus states that He will not drink the Cup again until the new Kingdom comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(9) Here, I will give you some from the synagogue of the Adversary, those who call themselves Jews but aren&amp;rsquo;t—on the contrary, they are lying—see, I will cause them to come and prostrate themselves at your feet, and they will know that I have loved you.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Is 49:23 Kings shall be your foster fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers. With their faces to the ground, they shall bow down to you and lick the dust off your feet. Then you will know that I am the LORD; those who wait for me shall not be put to shame.”  &lt;br&gt;Isa 45:22-25 “Turn to me and be saved, all the ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is no other. (23) By myself I have sworn; from my mouth has gone out in righteousness a word that shall not return: ‘To me, every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear allegiance.’ (24) “Only in the LORD, it shall be said of me, are righteousness and strength; to him shall come and be ashamed all who were incensed against him. (25) In the LORD all the offspring of Israel shall be justified and shall glory.”  &lt;br&gt;Est 8:17 And in every province and in every city, wherever the king&amp;rsquo;s command and his edict reached, there was gladness and joy among the Jews, a feast and a holiday. And many from the peoples of the country declared themselves Jews, for fear of the Jews had fallen on them.   &lt;br&gt;Psa 72:10-11 May the kings of Tarshish and of the coastlands render him tribute; may the kings of Sheba and Seba bring gifts! (11) May all kings fall down before him, all nations serve him! &lt;br&gt;Php 2:10-11 so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, (11) and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the typical seven letters outline, this is the section where we would expect a judgment; the part where Jesus says, &amp;ldquo;but I have this against you.&amp;rdquo; This section is entirely omitted from the letter to Smyrna. In the letter to Philadelphia, it is not a judgment pronounced on that assembly. Because of their conduct and faithfulness, the Philadelphia assembly will SIT IN JUDGMENT over non-believers. Then, this is not a judgment of punishment but one of conviction and repentance in the spirit of brotherly love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another connection to Smyrna is that the letters to both churches contain the phrase, &amp;ldquo;Synagogue of Satan.&amp;rdquo; We explored this phrase previously. To briefly recap, this could refer to Jews who are not upholding the high ethical standards required by Judaism, specifically by denouncing one&amp;rsquo;s neighbor, whom God says to love. Indeed, there is some evidence that the Believers (Jewish and Gentile) in Smyrna and Philadelphia may have been excluded from the mainline Jewish population.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It could also refer to the gentile satanic pseudo-salvific religion established by Rome. In that day, a synagogue was something we might call a town hall or a meeting place. It was not necessarily a Jewish religious gathering, although it later came to mean exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, in 3:9, we are given the additional insight that those in this evil gathering will be made to bow before believers in Yeshua. Isaiah, Psalms, and Ezekiel all state that the pagan nations of the world will come bow before Israel, which, in my view, lends more credibility to the &amp;ldquo;Synagogue of Satan&amp;rdquo; being comprised of gentiles. Isaiah 45:25 states that all the offspring of Israel shall be justified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esther is also a great book. It describes a plot by Haman, who tricks the king into sending out an order to slaughter all the Jews in Persia. Little does he know the new favored queen Esther is Jewish, and she has the King&amp;rsquo;s full attention. She skillfully approaches the King and turns the tables on Haman. The law of the day was that the King couldn&amp;rsquo;t directly rescind the first order, but he could counter it in a sense by allowing Jews to protect themselves. The photo above is from the palace where Esther would have presented herself to the King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haman even had ordered gallows built for a specific group of Jews that he hated, including Mordecai, Esther&amp;rsquo;s older cousin. Esther 7 is where all this unfolds. Ester had arranged a banquet for the King and Haman, where she turned the tables on Haman. The king was so furious he had to step outside to cool down at one point. He returns to find Haman begging for his life from Esther, who was reclining on her couch. You can imagine what this scene looked like to the King when he returned. &amp;ldquo;Will he even assault the queen in my presence, in my own house?&amp;hellip;So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king&amp;rsquo;s wrath abated&amp;rdquo; (Est 7:8, 10). What other people mean for evil, God will use for good. This is the kind of turn-around being spoken of in Rev 3:9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God repeatedly professes His love for the Jewish people in BOTH testaments, including and we might say, especially through their times of rebellion and unbelief. The book of Esther occurred during the period of the Babylonian exile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be challenging to reconcile this unique love for the Jewish people with Jesus&#39; statement that &amp;ldquo;no man comes to the Father except through Me,&amp;rdquo; except to say that both are true. To deny either one leads to a theological error. If we read Romans 11 carefully, God has not rejected unbelieving Jews in the same way that other unbelievers perish (Rom 11:1, 11. It sounds crazy, but maybe there are three categories: the saved believers in Yeshua, the unsaved gentiles, and the non-believing Jews, whom God will restore somehow. Hosea 1-2 describes a period of separation, where God gives Israel the name Lo Ammi, &amp;ldquo;not my people,&amp;rdquo; but then He extends His mercy to say &amp;ldquo;ami-attah, you are my people&amp;rdquo; (Hosea 2:23).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us are familiar with the verse, &amp;ldquo;The depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?” This comes from Roman 11:33,34, and contextually, Paul talks about what the ESV calls &amp;ldquo;the mystery of Israel&amp;rsquo;s salvation.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Romans 9-11 is a highly worthwhile study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, we should never read &amp;ldquo;synagogue of Satan&amp;rdquo; as an indictment against Judaism itself as a religion or the Jewish people. We must remember that the &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; in Philadelphia and all seven cities were at least 50% Jewish and possibly more like 70% or 80%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we hold to the church age theory, the letter to Philadelphia represents the missionary age from the 1700s to the 1900s. Curiously, this is the time when we saw the rise of many sects claiming to be the &amp;ldquo;True Israel,&amp;rdquo; including Mormonism, Jehovah&amp;rsquo;s Witnesses, Christian Science, and many others. As we&amp;rsquo;ve talked about repeatedly, Replacement Theology would suggest the church has become the true Israel. Could these be modern examples of &amp;ldquo;those who say they are Jews but are not&amp;rdquo; and truly are from the &amp;ldquo;assembly of the accuser&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(10) Because you did obey my message about persevering, I will keep you from the time of trial coming upon the whole world to put the people living on earth to the test.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Luk 21:20-21 “But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near. (21) Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are inside the city depart, and let not those who are out in the country enter it,  &lt;br&gt;Isa 26:18 we were pregnant, we writhed, but we have given birth to wind. We have accomplished no deliverance in the earth, and the inhabitants of the world have not fallen.  &lt;br&gt;2 Pe 2:9 then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment,   &lt;br&gt;Zec 13:9 And I will put this third into the fire, and refine them as one refines silver, and test them as gold is tested. They will call upon my name, and I will answer them. I will say, ‘They are my people’; and they will say, ‘The LORD is my God.’&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of a pre-tribulation rapture would see this verse as proof that God will remove the faithful before things get too bad. This may or may not be what the text is saying. It could just mean that God will preserve His people through the judgment, as He did with Noah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/2b37cfd620136225a54c39f26fa3466b.jpeg&#34; cap=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 21 appears to be a blended prophecy with part referring to the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE and part referring to the end of days. Verses 20-24 talk about the times beginning with the first Jewish Revolt in 66. Church tradition holds that as the situation in Jerusalem was deteriorating and Rome was preparing for its siege of Jerusalem, believing Jews in the city recalled Jesus&#39; instructions to get out and get out fast. They supposedly fled to the city of Petra in modern Jordan. The last part of the third Indiana Jones film where the building façade was carved into the cliff was shot in Petra.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I generally would align with the Pre-trib view. One aspect that makes me uncomfortable is that it could lead to believers thinking we will escape persecution. This is likely an American/western viewpoint. In the rest of the world, the church knows way more about being persecuted than we do. We should not be so self-important as to think we will escape what most of the church has had to endure for the past 2000 years. As we studied at the beginning of our study in Revelation Backgrounds, apocalyptic literature was provided to comfort people during times of intense struggle and exile. We may not be delivered from death as much as we may be delivered &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; death. In any case, believers are in a much better position than non-believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;people living on the earth&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; is interesting. Connotatively it is used repeatedly, not to mean every person on earth, but a subset of those who have rejected the Lord. We could say these are people who have focused their goals on this world instead of concentrating on Eternal things. We mentioned in an earlier lesson how there are the goyim, and then there is Israel. While technically Israel is another nation along with Egypt, Syria, Turkey, and America, spiritually, Israel is to be set apart. Believers live and dwell upon the earth along with unbelievers, but spiritually we are not earth-dwellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put to the test&lt;/strong&gt; does appear to refer to God&amp;rsquo;s judgment upon the earth. God is not willing that any should perish, but God is a God of justice at the end of the day. The rest of the book of Revelation is about the punishment; again, it is not punishment we need to worry about if we are His. Somehow, repentant believers need not fear this time, whether through rapture or some other form of protection and preservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;does-the-great-tribulation-purify-israel&#34;&gt;Does the Great Tribulation Purify Israel?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting back to restoration of Israel discussion from above, where we mentioned a possible distinction between gentiles who reject Yeshua and Jews who reject Yeshua, Some view the Great Tribulation as simultaneously being God&amp;rsquo;s wrath on an evil earth, as well as testing and purification for the non-messianic Jewish people to bring them to repentance. They base this on Zechariah 13:9: &amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;Zec 13:9&lt;/strong&gt; And I will put this third into the fire, and refine them as one refines silver, and test them as gold is tested. They will call upon my name, and I will answer them. I will say, ‘They are my people’; and they will say, ‘The LORD is my God.’&amp;rdquo; In his teaching on Genesis, Missler notes three groups of people. Those who perished in the flood, those who were preserved through the flood (Noah and his family), and those who were removed before the flood without dying (Enoch). It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait and see whether it pertains to a pre-tribulation rapture. Again, it should never be used by Christians to be hateful of Jews.  The biblical position is that God has not changed his position on having a unique love for the Jewish people. How he will reconcile that with their present unbelief in Jesus is His decision, not mine or yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Rom 11:25-36 Lest you be wise in your own sight, I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers: a partial hardening has come upon Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. (26) And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, “The Deliverer will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob”; (27) “and this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins.” (28) As regards the gospel, they are enemies for your sake. But as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers. (29) For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. (30) For just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience, (31) so they too have now been disobedient so that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy. (32) For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all. (33) Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! (34) “For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?” (35) “Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?” (36) For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a debate about whether many of these verses in Revelation 2-3 suggest a loss of salvation. Would God inscribe a name in a book, only to erase it because of some later rejection? If so, would this mean He is not omniscient? Because of John 10:28-29, I know I&amp;rsquo;m a man, and therefore I&amp;rsquo;m unable to snatch myself out of Jesus&#39; AND the Father&amp;rsquo;s hand. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe I have that ability. With that said, I&amp;rsquo;m also not comfortable saying that the person who professes a faith that he or she later renounces, perhaps after decades of faithful service, is &amp;ldquo;once saved, always saved.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m not willing to put myself in God&amp;rsquo;s shoes. Like Pastor Chuck Smith used to say, &amp;ldquo;If you abide in Christ, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about eternal security.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another category that believers CAN forfeit, and this is what appears to be in view in verse 11. That category is rewards. While we can be fortunate we will not face the Judgment for unbelievers; we do have what is called the Bema Seat Judgment ahead of us. This is where God will evaluate our works AFTER we were saved. Missler liked to ask his audience, &amp;ldquo;are you saved? If so, what have you done with it?&amp;rdquo; We will be judged on the treasure we stored up in Heaven, how we have loved our neighbor, how effective we have been at being &lt;em&gt;talmidim¸&lt;/em&gt;and how well we have raised up other &lt;em&gt;talmidim.&lt;/em&gt; One of the rewards is a crown, referenced in 2 Timothy 4:8. Even if we believe it is impossible to forfeit salvation, it IS possible to forfeit rewards through poor choices. If the believers in Philadelphia started to cave to the pressure, they would risk losing their crowns of righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul often spoke of winning the race, which is a metaphor for finishing well and receiving a victor&amp;rsquo;s crown. We should always be like Thyatira – our works today should be better than yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often think we will be given a crown (hopefully!) at the Bema seat judgment. Note that they ALREADY HAVE their crowns. Are you and I living our lives for the kingdom such that we already have our crowns? If so, the warning is to keep holding on and continuing what we&amp;rsquo;re doing. If not, every second we have breath is another opportunity to deny ourselves and live for Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned in the historical introduction, Philadelphia held fast until the late 14th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 3:12-13 I will make him who wins the victory a pillar in the Temple of my God, and he will never leave it. Also, I will write on him the name of my God and the name of my God&amp;rsquo;s city, the new Yerushalayim coming down out of heaven from my God, and my own new name. (13) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.&amp;rdquo; &#39;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1Ki 7:21 He set up the pillars at the vestibule of the temple. He set up the pillar on the south and called its name Jachin, and he set up the pillar on the north and called its name Boaz.  &lt;br&gt;Jer 1:18-19 And I, behold, I make you this day a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the people of the land. (19) They will fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you, for I am with you, declares the LORD, to deliver you.”  &lt;br&gt;Isa 56:4-5 For thus says the LORD: “To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, who choose the things that please me and hold fast my covenant, (5) I will give in my house and within my walls a monument and a name better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heavenly temple will be referenced in Revelation chapters 7, 11, 14, 15, and 16. Stern writes, &amp;ldquo;it is not surprising that its pillars will be believers.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2Pillars at Church of Philadelpha&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The later church building in Philadelphia erected these massive pillars, undoubtedly as a reference to Revelation 3:12.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible frequently refers to the faithful as various parts of a defensive stronghold. Probably most famously to Christians is Matthew 16, when Peter is given the keys and is told that the gates of hades will not prevail against the assembly. In Jeremiah 1, believers are as a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against which the enemies of God will not prevail. A pillar indicates power, as we saw with the massive columns at the Sardis temple of Artemis. And yes, these are phallic symbols in every sense. New York, Paris, London, Washington DC, and many other seemingly powerful cities all have phallic pillars as symbols, and that&amp;rsquo;s not by accident. As we progress through Revelation, we will see what becomes of man&amp;rsquo;s power system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve discussed the significance of one&amp;rsquo;s name as equivalent to one&amp;rsquo;s character. Here, the faithful will be inscribed the name of the Holy One (blessed be He). This is in direct opposition to the beast&amp;rsquo;s followers taking on the beast&amp;rsquo;s name/mark as a sign that they belong to him (Rev 13:17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;rsquo;t read the Bible and not acknowledge that God (Father and Son) loves Jerusalem, meaning the city at 31.7683° N, 35.2137° E on a map. Although He loves it, it is tainted by sin and will be restored and made new one day. He loves you and me that way too. When we go to Jerusalem, we are struck by the conflict and tension until we realize it&amp;rsquo;s a picture of us as simultaneously saint and sinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the &amp;ldquo;New Jerusalem&amp;rdquo; in Revelation 21, Jesus will rule for 1000 years from the current Jerusalem (Jeremiah 3:17). I highly encourage a scouting trip to Jerusalem so we know what we are getting ourselves into! To inscribe the name of a city signifies that those in Philadelphia will be citizens of that city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recap, there are four promises between verses 9 and 12:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A witness to the Jews who say they are not (9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be kept from the hour of trial (10) – see the &amp;ldquo;rapture&amp;rdquo; discussion in the church age section&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overcomer becomes a pillar in the Millennial Temple (12)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overcomer receives the name of Father, the new name of the Son, and the name of Jerusalem (12)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we may be second-class citizens in this age, we will be first-class citizens in the age to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;does-it-fit&#34;&gt;Does it fit?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;church-age-theory-philadelphia--evangelistic-church-1750-present&#34;&gt;Church age theory: Philadelphia = Evangelistic Church (1750-present)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphia and Laodicea highlight the possible defect of the church age theory. Although most proponents would assert that at least the last four churches if not all seven types of churches still exist today, we can infer that many of those commentators believe there are really only two churches. Philadelphia is the church of the true believers, in other words, the one the commentator attends. And Laodicea is the church everyone else attends. In other words, Laodicea is the church those who disagree with the commentator attend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphia is seen as the age of the missionary church: the tremendous evangelical explosion that began in the mid-1700s (which coincided with the founding of the United States). However, there is little to connect the situation in the first-century city with this period in church history. There is nothing in the letter that overtly commends Philadelphia for its missionary outreach, save perhaps verse 9, where the church is a loving example to those who &amp;ldquo;say they are Jews but are not.&amp;rdquo; On this point, Fructenbaum notes that this is the time when Jewish missions bore much fruit. He notes that by 1900, some 250,000 Jews became believers.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than this, we have to piece together the fact that Philadelphia was established as an outpost to spread Hellenism and apply the &amp;ldquo;open door&amp;rdquo; references, perhaps not in a way Jesus intended them to be understood. In that sense, during the missionary period beginning with the 1700s, the gospel spread prolifically and, virtually, unhindered to the four corners of the earth. Every door was open. Today that door is closing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphia is also viewed as the &amp;ldquo;raptured&amp;rdquo; church based on the reference to being kept from the time of trial. Because of these reasons, we all want to view ourselves as part of the church of Philadelphia, which is not a bad aspiration. Facetiously, I&amp;rsquo;d say that Smyrna might be in second place, but they were martyred. Who wants to be martyred when you can be raptured!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, we don&amp;rsquo;t find anyone boasting that they are in the church of Laodicea. Missler notes, &amp;ldquo;Let us remember that each of the churches had a different perception of themselves that the Lord Himself had. How sobering to us in our own conceits.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:21&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, the theory holds that the Jezebel element of Thyatira, the dead element of Sardis, and just about everyone in Laodicea will go through the tribulation, but Philadelphia along with the believing fragments from Thyatira, Sardis, and Laodicea will be raptured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally would love to be raptured. Imagine being taken out of this world with all its problems and persecutions, and then you get to be with Jesus! That sounds like a great deal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s the problem. The doctrine of the rapture appeals to my flesh. If I were the enemy, would I want Christians thinking they were going to get the easy way out, perhaps to the point where they start coasting and not engaging with the church&amp;rsquo;s mission? You bet I would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that an entire generation thought they understood the scriptures perfectly and had concluded that the Messiah was to be a political king, but they were wrong. As Missler would say, that should be sobering for us to the extent we think we know how unfulfilled prophecy will play out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;parables-philadelphia--pearl-of-great-price-mat-1345-46&#34;&gt;Parables: Philadelphia = Pearl of Great Price (Mat 13:45-46)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 13:45-46 “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, (46) who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler states, &amp;quot; Of all jewels, the pearl is the only one made by a living organism as a response to an irritation that has been introduced. It is then removed from its place of growth to become an item of adornment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the pearl is removed from the oyster (a non-kosher sea creature) is seen as the pure church&amp;rsquo;s removal from the gentile world prior to God&amp;rsquo;s judgment upon the world, where they will become a pillar, an item of adornment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could also say as a pun, during the missionary age, the world was the church&amp;rsquo;s oyster, though I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s what the Holy Spirit had in mind 2000 years ago!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;paul-philadelphia--thessalonians&#34;&gt;Paul: Philadelphia = Thessalonians&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there one of Paul&amp;rsquo;s letters that contains no judgment but is one of encouragement and perseverance? Is there a letter that addresses the &amp;ldquo;coming of the Lord&amp;rdquo; head-on? Yes! That would be the books of 1st and 2nd Thessalonians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Thessalonian church was commended for its faith (1 Th 1:3) and positive example (1 Th 1:7). Paul commends them for being witnesses (2:10), good students (2:13), and persevering through suffering (2:14). 1 Th 4:13-18 is often considered the passage that supports a pre-tribulation rapture. 2 Th 2:1-12 describes the figure known as &amp;ldquo;the antichrist&amp;rdquo; and appears to say that some restraining force is preventing the antichrist, the man of lawlessness, from attaining his full power. Once that restraining force is removed, then the man of lawlessness will be unleashed. By putting together Revelation 3:10, the promise for the faithful to be kept from the hour of trouble, with 1 Th 4:17, the promise for those living at the time to be caught up in the clouds, and 2 Th 2:7, the statement that the lawlessness will remain secret until the restrainer is removed, we get the theory that the church is the restraining force. Removing that power simultaneously keeps believers from the hour of trouble while unleashing the man of lawlessness upon the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, 2 Thessalonians 2:2 references a fake letter implying that the believers had not been caught up and were entering the period of God&amp;rsquo;s judgment. We don&amp;rsquo;t know who sent this letter, but it could be an example of someone &amp;ldquo;saying they were Jews (like Paul) but were not.&amp;rdquo; Missler sees this as evidence that the Thessalonians were concerned they had missed the rapture. Paul then explains about the restrainer and the man of lawlessness. Parenthetically, here is where I like to point out that grace is not the opposite of law. Lawless is the opposite of Law. The man of lawlessness wants you to think that Law and Grace are opposites!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you believe in a pre-tribulation rapture, I encourage you to do Acts 17:11 research. In no case should this be interpreted as a license to coast. 2 Thessalonians 3 states this directly. We are not to be idle. We must take the whole counsel of God into view. Even if a pre-trib rapture is true, Jesus had many parables saying that He expects His faithful to be diligently going about the kingdom&amp;rsquo;s work while He is away so that we are rewarded upon His return. A pre-trib rapture also does not mean we will be spared from persecution. We need only look at the church&amp;rsquo;s history to see that this isn&amp;rsquo;t true. Conversely, those of us in areas where there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been persecution have been given a much greater opportunity for kingdom work. To whom much is given, much is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Th 1:9-10 For they themselves report concerning us the kind of reception we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, (10) and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Th 2:13 And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Th 3:4 For when we were with you, we kept telling you beforehand that we were to suffer affliction, just as it has come to pass, and just as you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Th 3:12-13 and may the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and all, as we do for you, (13) so that he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Th 4:1-7 Finally, then, brothers, we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God, just as you are doing, that you do so more and more. (2) For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus. (3) For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; (4) that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, (5) not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God; (6) that no one transgress and wrong his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as we told you beforehand and solemnly warned you. (7) For God has not called us for impurity, but in holiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Th 4:15-17 For this we declare to you by a word from the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. (16) For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. (17) Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Th 5:2-5 For you yourselves are fully aware that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. (3) While people are saying, “There is peace and security,” then sudden destruction will come upon them as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. (4) But you are not in darkness, brothers, for that day to surprise you like a thief. (5) For you are all children of light, children of the day. We are not of the night or of the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Th 1:5 This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Th 2:15 So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the traditions that you were taught by us, either by our spoken word or by our letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Th 3:6 Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from any brother who is walking in idleness and not in accord with the tradition that you received from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Th 3:10 For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Laodicea, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the Ruler of God&amp;rsquo;s creation: (15) &amp;ldquo;I know what you are doing: you are neither cold nor hot. How I wish you were either one or the other! (16) So, because you are lukewarm, neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of my mouth! (17) For you keep saying, &amp;lsquo;I am rich, I have gotten rich, I don&amp;rsquo;t need a thing!&amp;rsquo; You don&amp;rsquo;t know that you are the one who is wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked! (18) My advice to you is to buy from me gold refined by fire, so that you may be rich; and white clothing, so that you may be dressed and not have to be ashamed of your nakedness; and eye salve to rub on your eyes, so that you may see. (19) As for me, I rebuke and discipline everyone I love; so exert yourselves, and turn from your sins! (20) Here, I&amp;rsquo;m standing at the door, knocking. If someone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he will eat with me. (21) I will let him who wins the victory sit with me on my throne, just as I myself also won the victory and sat down with my Father on his throne. (22) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.&amp;rdquo; &#39; &amp;quot;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the image above, Laodicea, Hierapolis, and Colossae were in very close proximity, and in terms of wealth and power, the cities formed the metroplex of their day. They are at the eastern end of the Meander River valley, with Miletus and Ephesus on the Western end of that valley. Therefore, it was a natural passageway to distribute goods to and from Ephesus. A second valley, the Lycus River valley, ran Northwest to Philadelphia or southeast to Syria. By the second century BCE, Laodicea became the wealthiest and most important of the three because it sat at the junction of these two valleys. The assembly in Laodicea was the furthest south and west of all the churches. After completing his circuit of bringing the letter to each of the seven assemblies (and likely others along the way), the human messenger would have likely returned to Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city was founded in the mid-200s BCE by Antiochus II, who named it after his wife, Laodice. Laodice combines the words for &amp;ldquo;the people&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;justice,&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or &amp;ldquo;the people ruling.&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This is an interesting name because this is a church where God is on the outside knocking to get in. The Laodiceans were doing what was right in their own eyes. In terms of pronunciation, Greek would have a hard &amp;ldquo;c&amp;rdquo; (Lah-od-ik&amp;rsquo;-i-ah).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/044a8bd7fd3af8f19cd31266a5ff2597.jpg&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a worldly perspective, the city almost had it all. The photo is from the Sacred Agora, one of the many commerce centers of the city.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Many of its supposed strengths will be referenced in Revelation.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; According to God, concerning the assembly of believers, they are not strengths at all but weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was THE banking center of Asia with large stores of gold (and an adjunct industry of gold refiners)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The assembly thinks they are rich, but they are spiritually poor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus offers HIS gold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Textile manufacturing and distribution, primarily black wool
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The assembly thinks they are clothed in righteousness, but they are naked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus offers HIS covering (white raiment versus black wool)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was a medical center, specifical ophthalmology; Collyrium was an ingredient used in healing eye salves as well as cosmetics
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The assembly thinks they have clear vision, but they are spiritually blind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus, the Great Physician, offers HIS remedy: the Holy Spirit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, entertainment was everywhere; it had a large stadium and multiple theaters
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike the actors and athletes who were adorned, the believers were wretched and pitiable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As with all cities, everything was dedicated to a false god
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though not stated directly, the conclusion, given the previous six letters. is that the Laodiceans comfortably co-mingled paganism with worship of Jesus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metaphorically and probably literally, they were dining at the table with false gods in pagan temples, which are the throne rooms of those gods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus invites the believers to dine with Him and Him alone in His throne room and His alone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/2037bd1299892847ad3cf244a76b64ed.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;47%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;In recent years, archeological work has uncovered many gates, buildings, pillars, inscriptions, and other findings, making it easy to visualize the city&#39;s wealth and prominence. The photo on the left shows a game board from Laodicea.[^5] The photo on the right shows a nearly identical inscription that was found on a stone in Jerusalem in the traditional location of the Stone Pavement.[^6] Some assert that it was the game used by the Roman soldiers when they cast lots for Jesus&#39; clothing right before His crucifixion.
&lt;p&gt;In Laodicea, there are also multiple Nymphaeum locations. A major street with ornate columns on either side ran through the heart of Laodicea. Over ½ mile has been excavated and reconstructed today. We believe it dates to 85 CE, so it would have been a street the believers frequented. The excavations are spectacular from an archaeological standpoint. We&amp;rsquo;ll include a photo gallery supplement after this lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The famous Roman philosopher Cicero lived here and cashed his letters of credit at the banks.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The city was so wealthy that, after a significant earthquake in 60CE, Laodicea refused financial assistance from Rome to help rebuild.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; They had it covered. They didn&amp;rsquo;t need anyone&amp;rsquo;s help. Rome commended this gesture, but unfortunately, this attitude spilled over into the local congregation of believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another record in 62 CE, Laodicea seized 20 pounds of gold that the city&amp;rsquo;s Jewish population (this presumably would have included both believers and non-believers) had earmarked for the Temple in Jerusalem. This suggests an offering from 7000 Jews in the city. If we include family, the Jewish population could have been well over 20,000. One tractate of the Jewish Talmud speaks of the immense wealth of a sure Laodicea Jew.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/0159b3c645b138b34acad47ca46b7776.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a fascinating story in another tractate&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that has some relevance to our study. It&amp;rsquo;s about a man from Laodicea who is sent to the land of Asher in Galilee to fetch a large quantity of olive oil to bring back to Laodicea. The photo above shows a reconstructed Olive Oil press from Yad HaShmonah, near Kiriath Jearim.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He gets what we might call the run-around and finally is told to go and see what to him appears to be a poor field laborer. The laborer tells him to wait until his workday is over. The Laodicean messenger believes he is being played for a fool. He waits, and they journey back to the man&amp;rsquo;s house, where the man&amp;rsquo;s maidservant brings out a kettle of hot water and a vat of oil in a golden bowl for the messenger to anoint his hands and feet. The laborer and the messenger ate and drank together. The &amp;ldquo;laborer&amp;rdquo; then offered the Laodicean even a greater quantity of oil than he initially needed and more than he could afford. The laborer extends the additional oil on credit and goes back to Laodicea with the messenger to help with the massive haul. The people of Laodicea come out to celebrate the messenger for his tremendous feat, but he replies, &amp;ldquo;do not praise me. Rather praise this man who has come with me,&amp;rdquo; as it is he who provided the oil. The story in the Talmud ends by saying, &amp;ldquo;This incident was in fulfillment of that which is stated: &amp;lsquo;There is one who seems to be rich yet has nothing; there is one who seems to be poor, yet has great wealth&amp;rsquo; (Proverbs 13:7).&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing Laodicea did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have was a consistent water supply. Colossae had cold water springs while Hierapolis had hot springs (and like many areas with natural hot springs, it continues today as a resort for tourists). Laodicea could occasionally use river water but otherwise required extensive aqueducts to pipe water in from neighboring cities. Of course, by the time it traveled, it was no longer refreshingly cold like Colossae or therapeutically hot like Hierapolis but a tepid, lukewarm temperature. Additionally, the mineral content was so high that the water, if ingested directly, would induce vomiting. Today, we can see the calcified pipes. We will reserve a discussion on the spiritual significance until we get to verse 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;new-testament-period&#34;&gt;New Testament Period&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/6659b0bd20c5ad2c231d337f195e3141.jpg&#34; caption=&#34;Cross and Menorah&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large number of Jews referenced above likely formed the foundation of the early community of believers in Yeshua. As a reminder, scholars believe that Jews would have significantly outnumbered the gentile &amp;ldquo;God-fearers.&amp;rdquo; Gentiles would have attended the Jewish synagogue and were divided between believers in Yeshua and non-believers, just as their Jewish counterparts were. The above column shows an inscription of a cross over a Menorah with a shofar, reminding us that our Messiah came out of the light of the Menorah (Rev 1:20).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We are also reminded that the word &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; is an anachronism, as no such word, congregation, or building went by that name in the first century. The term was &lt;em&gt;ecclesia&lt;/em&gt; and, in most respects, was synonymous with the word &lt;em&gt;sunagoge&lt;/em&gt; to mean an assembly and only later came to mean a gathering of gentile Christians and non-believing Jews, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laodicea is mentioned several times in Paul&amp;rsquo;s letter to the Colossians. Based on Col 1:7, a fair assumption is that Epaphras, an evangelist under Paul, founded churches at Colossae and at Hierapolis, and Laodicea. Col 4:15-16 instructs Colossae and Laodicea to exchange greetings and letters. Verse 16 also mentions that Paul wrote a letter to the Laodiceans that has since been lost (we can only wonder what it said given the later rebuke in Revelation…).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We don&amp;rsquo;t have any direct evidence that Paul himself visited there. Still, from Colossians 4, we can see that many of the &amp;ldquo;big names&amp;rdquo; of the early apostolic movement were known to Colossae, and presumably to Laodicea: Tychicus, who traveled with Paul extensively; John Mark, Barnabas, and Luke. Of course, John the Apostle likely knew them personally since he&amp;rsquo;s the one penning the letter and scholars believe all seven churches fell under John&amp;rsquo;s apostolic authority. This level of attention could attest to the fact that the population of believers was significant. Because the three cities were interconnected to some degree, a few scholars would see the situation of believers to be much the same in Colossae and Hierapolis as it was in Laodicea. Therefore, like the instruction to Colossae in Col 4:15-16, the letter to Laodicea may have been intended for all the wider believing communities.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verses 15-17, contain the darkest, most scathing rebuke of any of the seven letters. However, in true Jesus style, He doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave believers in that lost place but He desires to bring them back into the fold. Verse 18-20a tells us even though we may be lost, Jesus knows where we are. No matter how far we have wandered, He desires fellowship and restoration. However, He won&amp;rsquo;t violate our sovereignty. He makes the first move, but it is up to us to respond. Then the second part of verse 20 and verse 21 provides us the rewards of accepting His fellowship. We mention this, because like Sardis, there is some indication that, historically, the believers at Laodicea responded favorably. Although it didn&amp;rsquo;t last quite as long as Sardis and Philadelphia, the city lasted until the 13th century. Todd Bolen writes the following: &amp;quot; Some have suggested that Archippus, Philemon’s son (Philemon 2), was Laodicea’s pastor/bishop (cf. Colossians 4:17), based upon the 4th century Apostolic Constitutions. In the 4th century AD, Laodicea emerged as the prominent Christian center of the region of Phrygia and was the site of an important church council.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rev 3:14&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Laodicea, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the Ruler of God&amp;rsquo;s creation:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 1:1 In the beginning God created &amp;hellip; &lt;br&gt;Joh 1:1-3 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. (2) He was in the beginning with God. (3) All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.  &lt;br&gt;Isa 65:16 so that he who blesses himself in the land shall bless himself by the God of truth, and he who takes an oath in the land shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten and are hidden from my eyes. Deu 6:4 &amp;ldquo;Sh&amp;rsquo;m&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;, Yisra&amp;rsquo;el! Adonai Eloheinu, Adonai echa&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the description of the speaker, remember that the first five churches all had direct tie-ins to Revelation 1. For Philadelphia, we had a half reference to Revelation 1. Chapter 1 says &amp;ldquo;I have the keys of death and hades,&amp;rdquo; but Philadelphia was told, &amp;ldquo;the one…who has the key of David.&amp;rdquo; In Laodicea, we have zero direct references to Revelation chapter 1. This is a subtle clue that something is very different about this letter to the Laodiceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrew Lessons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amen Faithful and True:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;אמ&lt;/strong&gt;ן – it doesn’t just mean &amp;ldquo;the end&amp;rdquo; – in Hebrew it is a statement of affirmation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;נ&lt;strong&gt;אמ&lt;/strong&gt;ן – the faithful one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;אמ&lt;/strong&gt;ת - truth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Witness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/9b5f1709c4867dd89e0d75648a7be8e2.jpg&#34;  &gt;}}
In Hebrew, the word for witness is עד. In a Torah Scroll, when the famous Shema Israel is written, (&amp;ldquo;Hear O Israel, the LORD is our God, the LORD is one&amp;rdquo;) the final letters of &amp;ldquo;Hear&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;one&amp;rdquo; are enlarged. You can see a picture of a parchment copy of the Shema that I have. These enlarged letters are ע and ד, the word for &amp;ldquo;witness&amp;rdquo;. This reminds us that if we say, &amp;ldquo;The LORD is our God, the LORD is one,&amp;rdquo; our actions need to match our words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The believers in Laodicea were likely saying the Shema at least twice a day, and they were professing faith in Jesus, but their hearts and actions were far from Him. Strictly speaking, we are called to BE a witness. Witnessing is something we do, being a witness is who we are 24/7/365.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ִFinally, note the similarity between how the Hebrew translation of &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Ruler of God&amp;rsquo;s Creation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; compares with the first part of Genesis 1:1, &amp;ldquo;In the beginning, God Created.&amp;rdquo; They are only different by three letters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 3:14 - &lt;strong&gt;ראשית&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;בר&lt;/strong&gt;י&lt;strong&gt;א&lt;/strong&gt;ת ה&lt;strong&gt;אלהים&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:1 - ב&lt;strong&gt;ראשׁית&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ברא&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;אלהים&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Greek the word translated as beginning is &lt;em&gt;arche&lt;/em&gt; which means beginning, first origin, ruling power. We see this in words like &amp;ldquo;Archangel&amp;rdquo; or even &amp;ldquo;arch enemy.&amp;rdquo; This is not the first angel or enemy, but the supreme one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-315-16&#34;&gt;Rev 3:15-16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No praise: Judgment #1: Repent or be vomited&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Revelation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 3:15-16 &amp;ldquo;I know what you are doing: you are neither cold nor hot. How I wish you were either one or the other! (16) So, because you are lukewarm, neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of my mouth!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lev 18:24-25 “Do not make yourselves unclean by any of these things, for by all these the nations I am driving out before you have become unclean, (25) and the land became unclean so that I punished its iniquity, and the land vomited out its inhabitants.  &lt;br&gt;1Ki 18:20-21 So Ahab sent to all the people of Israel and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel. (21) And Elijah came near to all the people and said, “How long will you go limping between two different opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.” And the people did not answer him a word. &lt;br&gt;Jas 1:8 he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. &lt;br&gt;Mat 6:24 “No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sardis and Laodicea have no commendation. Later, we will look at how after the Fall, God sought out Adam. This is an example of standing at the door and knocking. It is also an example of &amp;ldquo;I know your works.&amp;rdquo; We cannot hide from God. Perhaps the Laodicean church had gotten so comfortable, they didn&amp;rsquo;t think they had a need to hide from God, but in fact they were far away. Let us never be complacent. As we&amp;rsquo;ve talked about, ask God to audit your works every so often. Make sure little errors don&amp;rsquo;t turn into big ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/701a67312121a85e19d6637c8a8e1851.jpg&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our culture, we use &amp;ldquo;hot&amp;rdquo; to mean spiritually hot, on fire for God. We use &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo; to mean distant and backslidden. In that context, &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo; would be the worst. Note that Jesus is saying cold is better than lukewarm. This is not referring to the spiritual temperature but the effectiveness of their works. Hot works are as soothing and healing as the medicinal hot springs from Hierapolis. Cold works are as refreshing and replenishing as the cold springs from Colossae. Aqueduct water in Laodicea arrived lukewarm, and because of the mineral content, it was distasteful and unusable. This would have been a vivid picture for the Laodiceans. The photo above shows the calcified water pipes, some of which are completely blocked.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; God can use &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;hot&amp;rdquo; works, but He can&amp;rsquo;t use the spiritually lukewarm. When we become so unclean as to be unusable, God has no choice but to vomit us out like He describes in Leviticus 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/4c49ddfb1142d8608d2909a233fc37ce.png&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Elijah might say, let us make sure we are not wavering between two opinions, and so becoming lukewarm. When we go to Mount Carmel, the setting for 1 Kings 18 pictured above&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, this is the challenge we give to our groups. Go all-in for God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who would argue salvation can be lost can&amp;rsquo;t see how Jesus/God spewing a professing believer out of His mouth can mean anything but a loss of salvation. Indeed, the warnings for the unrepentant or those who do not hold fast are alarming. An alternate view is that a loss of rewards, but not salvation is in view. One must admit that Jesus spewing out of His mouth sounds every bit as condemning as being cast out to where there is weeping or gnashing of teeth. Other verses would indicate that our salvation is secure. In this case, it is best to make sure we are abiding in God, and we don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, Jesus is using strong language to motivate the Laodiceans to change their ways. Jesus does this frequently in the Gospels. For example, in Matthew 16:23, He calls Peter &amp;ldquo;Satan.&amp;rdquo; In a sense, His sharp exchanges with the Pharisees where He uses similar provocative language (ex. Mat 23:27, John 8) could be an attempt to wake them up because He loves them, not because He hates them. Laodicea is a sheep that has wandered off. While there were assuredly non-believers in their midst, the true believers in Laodicea knew His voice and responded. He is calling to us too. A sheep can only serve one shepherd. We have a choice to make, and it&amp;rsquo;s not a one-time choice. It&amp;rsquo;s a moment-by-moment choice whether we will live for Him or live for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judgment #2: Repent or continue in spiritual nakedness/blindness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 3:17-18 For you keep saying, &amp;lsquo;I am rich, I have gotten rich, I don&amp;rsquo;t need a thing!&amp;rsquo; You don&amp;rsquo;t know that you are the one who is wretched, pitiable, poor, blind and naked! (18) My advice to you is to buy from me gold refined by fire, so that you may be rich; and white clothing, so that you may be dressed and not have to be ashamed of your nakedness; and eyesalve to rub on your eyes, so that you may see.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hos 12:6-8 “So you, by the help of your God, return, hold fast to love and justice, and wait continually for your God.” (7) A merchant, in whose hands are false balances, he loves to oppress. (8) Ephraim has said, “Ah, but I am rich; I have found wealth for myself; in all my labors they cannot find in me iniquity or sin.”  &lt;br&gt;Joh 15:5 I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest person to deceive is yourself. Those who are rich would see that as evidence of the blessing of God&amp;rsquo;s favor. It may be that, or it may be a situation where to whom much is given, much is asked. If God has granted us wealth, we should be using that for the kingdom, not for our comforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, this letter is not that much different from the first six letters. All the assemblies were being pressured to compromise. Some congregations fared better than others. Lizorkin states, &amp;ldquo;The kind of wealth and comfort mentioned here could only have been achieved if (the Laodicean&amp;rsquo;s) full participation in Pagan Roman society is presumed.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern makes a great comment: &amp;ldquo;Yeshua here does not command but offers His advice. Being infinitely wise, he knows the Laodiceans are far too undisciplined to obey orders.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics point out that these verses aptly describe the 20th and 21st-century church, with its prosperity doctrine, in-house coffee stands, and comfy chairs with cupholders more fitting for a place of entertainment than a house of worship. Chuck Missler quips that the &amp;ldquo;name it and claim it&amp;rdquo; bunch ARE scriptural. Right here in Revelation 3:17, it says they are poor naked, and blind!&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hosea 12, Hosea is prophesying about the coming destruction of Ephraim, which is a euphemism for the Northern Kingdom. It&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that when a New Testament author alludes to an Old Testament passage, it&amp;rsquo;s not the specific verse that the author wants his reader to understand but the entire passage. In Hosea 12, God is talking about rebuking Ephraim and sending them back into the wilderness because of their lack of faith and on cleanliness in His eyes. The warning John alludes to from Hosea would have been abundantly clear to the believers in Laodicea. It should also be abundantly clear to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/76d6d79e2b38eea17e945537d28c2703.jpg&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the letter to Smyrna, Jesus says they are rich, even though they see themselves as poor (Rev 2:9). Here, the Laodiceans are opposites. They are poor, though they view themselves as wealthy. And not just poor but spiritually naked and utterly blind to their condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an indictment of wealth itself. We believe many of Jesus&amp;rsquo; disciples were wealthy, including Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathea, and the family of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus. Wealth can be a trap and can quickly become an idol in one&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether rich or poor, the solution is the same and is contained in verse 18. We need to acquire the type of gold that can&amp;rsquo;t be bought with money. We need to be clothed in His righteousness, and like the numerous blind people that Jesus healed, we need to have our spiritual blindness removed. His healings of physical blindness, particularly John 9:1-7, are juxtaposed against the nation&amp;rsquo;s spiritual blindness in the Gospels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these things are free, yet they cost everything. Jesus puts these in terms of financial transactions so they would resonate with worldly people. We are no different. We need to give up the things of this world and repent of our inherent unclean status. Therefore the Old Testament emphasizes what is clean vs. unclean. The more we realize what is unclean, the more this is a picture of us. We abide in Him and reject our way of doing things. He makes us clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in view is the context of honor and shame. The word in verse 18 should probably be rendered as &amp;ldquo;shame,&amp;rdquo; not &amp;ldquo;ashamed.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Honor and shame&amp;rdquo; were a very big deal in ancient societies. Part of how we know our society today is degrading is that the concept of shame is dwindling. In ancient times, honor was a positive and was highly prized. Shame is the opposite, negative social status that was to be avoided. The proverbs often speak of the righteous versus the wicked, clean versus unclean, and honor versus shameful. The Laodiceans were in the status of shamed. Ashamed is an emotion, but shame is a status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-319&#34;&gt;Rev 3:19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary encouragement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Revelation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 3:19 As for me, I rebuke and discipline everyone I love; so exert yourselves, and turn from your sins!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Pro 3:11-12 My son, do not despise the LORD&amp;rsquo;s discipline or be weary of his reproof, (12) for the LORD reproves him whom he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights. (also quoted in Heb 12:6) &lt;br&gt;Jas 5:19-20 My brothers, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back, (20) let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from his wandering will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the secondary encouragement has a dark undertone. We have no &amp;ldquo;there are a few of you in Laodicea who have held fast&amp;rdquo; acknowledgment. Jesus must explain that His strong rebuke is an encouragement because He loves them. This is a plea to repent. Notice that everywhere in the Bible we are told to repent, there is a sense of urgency attached. A big warning sign would be when we say, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t need to repent&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not ready to repent.&amp;rdquo; Stern writes, &amp;ldquo;it takes effort to lift oneself out of apathy and turn from sin.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 19 is entirely in keeping with Romans 8:1. We are not being condemned if we are believers. As Proverbs 3:12 says, a loving parent would not let a child continue along the wrong path. To do so would not be loving. The fact that God rebukes the Laodiceans and occasionally must rebuke us is not an example of his hating us. He loves us and wants what&amp;rsquo;s best for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we are to be like James in leading someone who has wandered to return to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Proverbs 3:12 in Hebrew&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is something very interesting with the Hebrew of Proverbs 3:12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular Hebrew word order is verb-subject-object.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So if this were a typical sentence, it would read in Hebrew, &amp;ldquo;rebukes God the one He loves.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever there is a deviation from the normal pattern, it should get our attention. There is such a deviation here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The literal word order translation would be like, &amp;ldquo;the one He loves, God, he rebukes.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, LOVE is the action verb that is being stressed in the sentence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even though the main verb is technically &amp;ldquo;rebukes,&amp;rdquo; God wants to stress His love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular English word order is subject-verb-object.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Lord rebukes the one He loves&amp;rdquo; is a technically accurate translation but somehow misses the meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here we see God&amp;rsquo;s, parental heart.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No loving parent enjoys rebuking or punishing his or her child&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we want our children to mature, sometimes we have to do things we would prefer not to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the same way with God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes, he has to send unfaithful Ephraim back into the wilderness; sometimes, He has to do the same with us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True repentance means we don&amp;rsquo;t just give lip service and ask for forgiveness every time we sin. We are supposed to turn away from our old ways. Repentance is active, not passive. Fortunately for us, God&amp;rsquo;s pursuit is also active and not passive, as we see in verse 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-320&#34;&gt;Rev 3:20:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is outside knocking to be let in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Revelation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 3:20 Here, I&amp;rsquo;m standing at the door, knocking. If someone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he will eat with me.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 3:8-9 And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden. (9) But the LORD God called to the man and said to him, “Where are you?”  &lt;br&gt;Zec 1:1-4 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, son of Iddo, saying, (2) “The LORD was very angry with your fathers. (3) Therefore say to them, Thus declares the LORD of hosts: Return to me, says the LORD of hosts, and I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts. (4) Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets cried out, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, Return from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.’ But they did not hear or pay attention to me, declares the LORD. &lt;br&gt;Luk 22:28-30 “You are those who have stayed with me in my trials, (29) and I assign to you, as my Father assigned to me, a kingdom, (30) that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As J. Vernon McGee might say, &amp;ldquo;will you notice?&amp;rdquo; Will you notice that this church is so far off track that Jesus isn&amp;rsquo;t even allowed inside? He&amp;rsquo;s outside knocking to be let in. He is not willing that any should perish and extends the invitation for those who repent that they will let him in and then dine with him in the messianic banquet in the age to come. But for now, we must realize that any church that has Jesus outside knocking to get it could not be described as a &amp;ldquo;saved church.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is a beautiful invitation for anyone who needs renewed fellowship with our Master in a general context. In Jewish thought, mealtime, particularly a Shabbat dinner, is a time for profoundly intimate fellowship. It&amp;rsquo;s a time to be fully present with one another. That is the intimacy Jesus is offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we must understand that Jesus will meet with us, but He does so on His terms, not ours. It is so easy to make &amp;ldquo;our Jesus&amp;rdquo; into a god of our own making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is holy, and no compromise, contamination, or uncleanliness is allowed in His presence. He can make us clean, but we must choose not to compromise. We must be on our guard for errors in teaching, such as from the Nicolaitans, Balaam, or Jezebel. Those groups all made the same error: they believed and were taught that God conformed to their image. Therefore, we stress Acts 17:11. We need to be Bereans to make sure our image of God conforms to the Bible and is not something we&amp;rsquo;ve made up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, in Revelation, the topic of eating surfaces in contrast to those who have defiled themselves with worldly teachings. Whether the dietary laws have been abolished or not, I can guarantee you Yeshua&amp;rsquo;s messianic dinner will not have pork or shellfish. That gives me something to think about. Eating is essential to God. Would He change His mind on what we can and can&amp;rsquo;t eat, particularly given Acts 15? Not sure about that. I&amp;rsquo;m worried that the thought that we can eat whatever we want the same as the world does might be a false teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may think that repentance is a New Testament invention, but it goes back to the Garden. After Adam and Eve sinned, who went looking for them? Of course, it was God. He was there knocking. When Abraham was an idol-worshipping gentile in the Ur of the Chaldees, God was there knocking. When Jacob was utterly lost, God was there knocking. For the Israelites in the wilderness, for the people in Judges who were doing what was right in their own eyes, for David who in one night broke nearly every one of the Ten Commandments, for the Kings of Israel and Judah who were worshipping false gods along with the one true God, for the lost sheep of Israel, for you and me, God stands at the door and knocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 3:21-22 I will let him who wins the victory sit with me on my throne, just as I myself also won the victory and sat down with my Father on his throne. (22) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.&amp;rdquo; &#39; &amp;quot;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Heb 4:14-16 Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. (15) For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. (16) Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.   &lt;br&gt;He who has an ear 7x in Revelation and 7x in the Gospels: Mat 11:15, Mat 13:9, Mat, 13:43; Mar 4:9, Mar 4:23, Luk 8:8, Luk 14:34  &lt;br&gt;1Jn 5:4-5 For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith. (5) Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?  &lt;br&gt;Joh_16:33 I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Victory in Jesus&amp;rdquo; has become a cliché phrase. I for one am guilty of giving lip service to being victorious but living my life like one who is defeated. I think many believers are like me. Part of the reason is, like the Laodiceans, we have our eyes on the wrong things. We are looking at the things of this world to provide peace and security. The great news is this outlook is a weakness we can lay at His feet and receive help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that He uses the term victory for Laodicea. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that the most victorious believers in our day are the ones who have come from the darkest places, and spiritually, Laodicea was in the darkest place of the seven assemblies. In Luke 7:46-47, Jesus says those who have been forgiven of much, love much, but those who have been forgiven little love little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of His victory, we can have true victory. Our church runs a program called &amp;ldquo;Celebrate Recovery&amp;rdquo; or CR for short. It&amp;rsquo;s not just for substance abuse but for anyone with a hurt, habit, or hang-up. Raise your hand if you have a hurt, habit, or hang-up. I was skeptical about CR at first, and there are still some things about it I&amp;rsquo;m not crazy about, but we can&amp;rsquo;t argue with the changed lives and the fact that once defeated believers are now victorious. We&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about how these seven letters are like getting an audit report. With every audit, there is what is called the remediation or corrective action phase. If through these letters, Jesus has revealed any behaviors that are interfering with our walk, then CR would be a great place to implement corrective action and come out living more victorious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reward for answering the knock on the door is absolutely staggering. We will sit with Him on His throne. We get to participate in the messianic kingdom in the age to come. However, being informed and giving intellectual assent is not enough. We must &amp;ldquo;Shema&amp;rdquo; these words. Believe and obey what the Spirit is saying to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we have the 7th and final time &amp;ldquo;He who has an ear&amp;rdquo; appears in Revelation. It also occurs seven times in the Gospels. What a &amp;ldquo;coincidence!&amp;rdquo; You can see the citations above. 1 John describes how to be an overcomer: believe that Jesus is the son of God. Of course, this means to believe in the Hebraic sense, not the Greek sense of merely giving intellectual assent. An overcomer lives his or her life knowing that we overcome by putting our trust in the One who has overcome the world. An overcomer doesn&amp;rsquo;t compromise. An overcomer doesn&amp;rsquo;t waver between two opinions. An overcomer doesn&amp;rsquo;t doubt His promises. Being an overcomer is not easy, but neither is it impossible. An overcomer makes a moment-by-moment choice to live for Him and deny himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Apostate&amp;rdquo; is a $10 word that means fallen away or renouncing a previous belief that one professes to have. We&amp;rsquo;ve talked about &amp;ldquo;Jews in name only&amp;rdquo; through these letters. The Apostate Church contains &amp;ldquo;Christians in name only.&amp;rdquo; In Matthew 15:18, Jesus quotes Isa 29:13 And the Lord said: “Because this people draw near with their mouth and honor me with their lips, while their hearts are far from me.&amp;rdquo; An apostate is not merely an unbeliever but one who is actively proclaiming destructive theology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a church that is conforming to the world&amp;rsquo;s image and pushing out God. This behavior was prophesied by Paul in 2Th 2:3 Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction.&amp;rdquo; The word the ESV uses for &amp;ldquo;rebellion&amp;rdquo; is &lt;em&gt;eapostasia&lt;/em&gt;. We may think of rebellion in the sense of unbelievers rebelling against God, but this could be a rebellion or falling away from &lt;strong&gt;within&lt;/strong&gt; the apostate church. See the callout box below for additional verses speaking of apostasy in the last days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roots of our modern apostasy can be traced to the turn of the 20th century, particularly with the development of so-called &amp;ldquo;higher criticism&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;documentary hypothesis.&amp;rdquo; These philosophies denied the inerrancy of the Bible using German rationalist methods. These slowly began to infiltrate what we might call the mainline denominations, particularly the Presbyterian church by a guy named Charles Briggs who was a seminary professor at the Union theological Seminary. So we had a modernist liberal (in the Christian sense, not a political sense) in a prominent position now teaching future ministers who spread liberalism throughout their churches. This caused a great divide between so-called modernists and fundamentalists. If we are Southern Baptists, we can be proud to say that the SBC has generally rejected modernist thought, though not without a struggle.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:21&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The same cannot be said for just about every other major denomination. Rather than fight the apostasy, these churches stress &amp;ldquo;unity,&amp;rdquo; but it is unity with liberal tenets.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:22&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Again, it seems the very folks who preach tolerance are the most intolerant of you if you disagree with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/c3c08426bc3f498a879c2e0276149e5b.jpg&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Laodiceans were also wealthy and comfortable. Bolen writes, &amp;ldquo;as the city grew, so did the theater-hungry crowds. To supplement the outgrown Western Theater, the bigger and more expensive Northern Theater was built.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:23&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:23&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to many churches today is not much different than going to a rock concert. We have comfy chairs sometimes with cup holders, the theater is dark, except for the lights on the stage, the music is loud, there are smoke machines, and some even have a merch table in the lobby next to the coffee stand. A &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; service may be defined as one that emotionally stirred me. A &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; service is when the pastor preaches a sermon from the Word that challenges and makes me uncomfortable. Church programs are based on people what they want, not on what they need.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:24&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:24&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Fructenbaum quips, &amp;ldquo;Satan would not be a very good deceiver if he made one feel badly (sic), would he? Satan can give people joyful and happy experiences rather than the Word of God. (These experiences become) the final authority for determining spiritual truth.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:25&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:25&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fructenbaum also pointed out that Paul of all people could easily have used his &amp;ldquo;experience&amp;rdquo; on the Damascus Road in his preaching as a tool for evangelism, but he did not. He always preached the Word of God and taught how Jesus was the fulfillment of the Scriptures. Personal testimonies are fantastic, but God&amp;rsquo;s word is the final authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend Dr. Dan Stolebarger recalls a dream he had once where Jesus was in the backseat of his car. Jesus asked, &amp;ldquo;Where are we going?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re going to church!&amp;rdquo; was the reply. &amp;ldquo;Ah, I see,&amp;rdquo; said Jesus. So they went inside to the service and came out about an hour later. &amp;ldquo;What was that again?&amp;rdquo; asked Jesus. &amp;ldquo;That was church!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Not what I had in mind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, our goal is not to be critical of others’ practices but more to look at areas in our lives where we are compromising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;parables-laodicea--dragnet-mat-1347-50&#34;&gt;Parables: Laodicea = Dragnet (Mat 13:47-50)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 13:47-50 “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind. (48) When it was full, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into containers but threw away the bad. (49) So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous (50) and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see the separation of the good and the bad (and note the good remain while the bad are thrown away). Jesus explains the parable in verses 49-50. Laodicea was given the opportunity to repent. Human nature tells us that likely only a small remnant did, while a vast majority went on their way and perished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;paul-laodicea--colossians&#34;&gt;Paul: Laodicea = Colossians&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter to the Colossians is a natural fit for Laodicea. As we&amp;rsquo;ve noted, the two were sister cities and in Colossians 4:16-17, the two cities are instructed to exchange letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 1:13 He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Colossians 1:15, we see a direct reference to Revelation 3:14: &amp;ldquo;He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 2:1-4 For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and for those at Laodicea and for all who have not seen me face to face, (2) that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, to reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of God&amp;rsquo;s mystery, which is Christ, (3) in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. (4) I say this in order that no one may delude you with plausible arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 2:8 See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 2:16 Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is usually taught that this verse is one that allows gentiles to eat anything, and it is &amp;ldquo;Judaizers&amp;rdquo; who are telling believers they must follow the Jewish law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In keeping with Acts 15:29 (the directives to gentile believers commanding them to stay avoid eating and behaving sexually like pagans) and the general Roman cult society in which the assembly at Colossae found themselves, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be just as likely that the mostly Jewish body was trying to the Jewish dietary laws, Rosh Chodesh (a minor holiday celebrating the first day of the month, which coincides with the arrival of the new moon), and keeping Shabbat in the face of opposition from the pagan majority?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, remember that to Paul, a Jew, pork and shellfish were not merely “unclean food”; to him, those were not “food” at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-read Colossians 2 in light of what we know about the seven churches and Laodicea specifically. Whose &amp;ldquo;regulations&amp;rdquo; in verse 20 is it more likely Paul was referring to? Instructions from God&amp;rsquo;s Word or the pagan world&amp;rsquo;s practices? Acts 17:11!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 2:23 These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion and asceticism and severity to the body, but they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 3:1-3 If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. (2) Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. (3) For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 3:5-6 Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. (6) On account of these, the wrath of God is coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 3:11 Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all, and in all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again, this is often taught that the Jewish believers said the Gentile believers had to be more Jewish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if it was the opposite? Overall in Colossae, the pagan population outnumbered Jews. What if it was the formerly pagan gentiles attempting to introduce non-Biblical practices into the Synagogue to blend in with society at large?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The church today has a generally condemning attitude towards Messianic Jews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 4:6 Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 4:11 and Jesus who is called Justus. These are the only men of the circumcision among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul&amp;rsquo;s use of &amp;ldquo;the circumcision&amp;rdquo; is not necessarily pejorative. It just means &amp;ldquo;Jewish.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 4:15-16 Give my greetings to the brothers at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house. (16) And when this letter has been read among you, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and see that you also read the letter from Laodicea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Colossians 4:17, Paul writes, &amp;ldquo;And say to Archippus, “See that you fulfill the ministry that you have received in the Lord.” There is a church tradition that Archippus later became the bishop of Laodicea. If so, the speculation is that his weakness, whatever it was that Paul saw as coming up short, contributed to their dire spiritual condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are a couple of interesting names mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 4:10 Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, and Mark the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you have received instructions—if he comes to you, welcome him),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare Act_15:39, And there arose a sharp disagreement so that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colossians was written after Acts 15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark was &amp;ldquo;redeemed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 4:14 Luke the beloved physician greets you, as does Demas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare 2 Ti 4:10 For Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colossians was written BEFORE 2 Timothy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demas, once a fellow worker (Phm 24), fell away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;After these things, I looked; and there before me was a door standing open in heaven; and the voice like a trumpet which I had heard speaking with me before said, &amp;ldquo;Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after these things.&amp;rdquo; (2) Instantly I was in the Spirit, and there before me in heaven stood a throne, and on the throne Someone was sitting. (3) The One sitting there gleamed like diamonds and rubies, and a rainbow shining like emerald encircled the throne. (4) Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on the thrones sat twenty-four elders dressed in white clothing and wearing gold crowns on their heads. (5) From the throne came forth lightnings, voices and thunderings; and before the throne were seven flaming torches, which are the sevenfold Spirit of God. (6) In front of the throne was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. In the center, around the throne, were four living beings covered with eyes in front and behind. (7) The first living being was like a lion, the second living being was like an ox, the third living being had a face that looked human, and the fourth living being was like a flying eagle. (8) Each of the four living beings had six wings and was covered with eyes inside and out; and day and night they never stop saying, &amp;ldquo;Holy, holy, holy is Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies the One who was, who is and who is coming!&amp;rdquo; (9) And whenever the living beings give glory, honor and thanks to the One sitting on the throne, to the One who lives forever and ever, (10) the twenty-four elders fall down before the One sitting on the throne, who lives forever and ever, and worship him. They throw their crowns in front of the throne and say, (11) &amp;ldquo;You are worthy, Adonai Eloheinu, to have glory, honor and power, because you created all things—yes, because of your will they were created and came into being!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are entering the apocalyptic phase, so there won&amp;rsquo;t be much geography and probably not many pictures. We&amp;rsquo;re basically going to track down and read some passages that the original audience likely would have known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we said at the outset of our study in Revelation, part of the challenge with apocalyptic literature is that the person recording the events is trying to describe the indescribable. Therefore, they are forced to use symbolic language that at times seems other-worldly (because it IS other-worldly; it&amp;rsquo;s not of this world!). This makes any concrete interpretation difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As there are numerous competent commentaries offering various conjectures on what Revelation chapters four and following could mean for 20th and 21st-century believers, we will &lt;em&gt;attempt&lt;/em&gt; to limit our study here to identifying and studying the allusions and common themes that appear elsewhere in the Bible. Where possible, we will limit conjectures to those that could have been understood by the original 1st-century audience. In any case, we will attempt to put aside any preconceptions and let the Text speak for itself, even though this may mean quoting an equally cryptic passage from the Old Testament. In the interest of time we won&amp;rsquo;t be able to unpack everything. Just soak it in and remember Isaiah 55:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 55:8-11 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the LORD. (9) For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts. (10) “For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return there but water the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater, (11)  &lt;strong&gt;so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose&lt;/strong&gt;, and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 11 means that any time we can spend studying God&amp;rsquo;s word is productive and profitable time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://talmidimway.com/uploads/rev-4-verses.pdf&#34;&gt;Revelation 4 Cross-reference Verses PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-41-the-heavenly-temple&#34;&gt;Rev 4:1-The Heavenly Temple&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After these things&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;I looked&lt;/strong&gt;; and there before me was a door standing open in heaven; and the voice like a trumpet which I had heard speaking with me before said, &amp;ldquo;Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after these things.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;meta-tauta-after-these-things&#34;&gt;Meta Tauta &amp;ldquo;after these things&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This serves as a transition from the previous vision of the seven assemblies to this vision in the heavenly throne room.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A roughly equivalent phrase in the Hebrew Bible is &amp;ldquo;I looked, and behold.&amp;rdquo;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Eze 10:1 Then I &lt;strong&gt;looked, and behold&lt;/strong&gt;, on the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubim there appeared above them something like a sapphire, in appearance like a throne.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Dan 10:5 &lt;strong&gt;I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold,&lt;/strong&gt; a man clothed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On that note, Heiser sees Rev 4-6 as a &amp;ldquo;divine council&amp;rdquo; scene, just like Isaiah 6, Ezekiel 1 and Daniel 7&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep in mind that &amp;ldquo;Meta Tauta&amp;rdquo; might NOT mean the next thing that happens chronologically.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It could simply be the next part of the revelation: after that vision, comes the next vision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since other parts of the bible are not in chronological order, we should not necessarily assume Revelation is in chronological order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;heaven-opened&#34;&gt;Heaven opened&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus promised this in John 1:51
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;John 1:51 And he said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, &lt;strong&gt;you will see heaven opened&lt;/strong&gt;, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the heavenly temple referenced in Hebrews.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Heb 9:24 For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are several other examples of a mortal being given a glimpse of the heavenly realm:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jacob
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Genesis 28:12-16 And he dreamed, and behold, there was a &lt;strong&gt;ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it&lt;/strong&gt;! (13) And behold, the LORD stood above it and said, “I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring. (14) Your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you and your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed. (15) Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land. For I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” (16) Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moses
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Exodus 19:19-20 And as the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in thunder. (20) The LORD came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. &lt;strong&gt;And the LORD called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Isaiah 6:1 In the year that King Uzziah died &lt;strong&gt;I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne&lt;/strong&gt;, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ezekiel
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ezekiel 1:1 In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the exiles by the Chebar canal, the heavens were opened, &lt;strong&gt;and I saw visions of God&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Daniel 7:1-2 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head as he lay in his bed. Then he wrote down the dream and told the sum of the matter. (2) Daniel declared, “&lt;strong&gt;I saw in my vision by night&lt;/strong&gt;, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Daniel 10:5  &lt;strong&gt;I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold&lt;/strong&gt;, a man clothed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster sees the High Holy Days liturgy.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The doors to the Temple would open at Rosh Hashana to the sound of the shofar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They would stay open through the 10 days of awe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They would close at the sound of another trumpet after Yom Kippur.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;come-up-here-and-i-will-show-you&#34;&gt;Come up here and I will show you&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Come up here&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; recalls God&amp;rsquo;s call to Moses
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Exo 19:24 And the LORD said to him, “Go down, and come up bringing Aaron with you. But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, lest he break out against them.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;I will show you&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; recalls Jacob&amp;rsquo;s prophecies in Genesis 49.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Genesis 49:1 Then Jacob called his sons and said, “Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what shall happen to you in days to come.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-42-in-spirit&#34;&gt;Rev 4:2-In spirit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Instantly I was in (the) spirit, and there before me in heaven stood a throne, and on the throne, Someone was sitting.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;in-the-sspirit&#34;&gt;In (the) S/spirit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As with Rev 1:10, the Greek does not have a definite article.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John was literally &amp;ldquo;in spirit.&amp;rdquo; We can interpret this as a hyper spiritual trancelike state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This may mean only that John was not in the body (or like Paul, &amp;ldquo;whether in the body, or out of the body I do not know – God knows.&amp;rdquo; (2 Cor 12:2))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ezekiel literally says &amp;ldquo;it lifted me up spirit&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Eze 11:1 Then &lt;strong&gt;the S/spirit lifted me up&lt;/strong&gt; and brought me to the East Gate of the LORD&amp;rsquo;s house, &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Eze 11:24 Then &lt;strong&gt;the S/spirit took me up&lt;/strong&gt; and brought me in a vision by the &lt;strong&gt;Spirit of God&lt;/strong&gt; into Chaldea, to those in captivity. And the vision that I had seen went up from me. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again, there is no definite article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, the Hebrew is vague about whether this is the spirit of God or just in spirit as the opposite of in the body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translations that capitalize the &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; in spirit are assuming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John, like Isaiah and Ezekiel, was somehow transported in a vision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sitting&#34;&gt;Sitting&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again, the One sitting is not named.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re reminded that John knew Jesus as well as anyone did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If John does not assume this is Jesus, maybe we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Holy One sitting is an allusion to Isaiah 6
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Isaiah 6:1 In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord &lt;strong&gt;sitting upon a throne&lt;/strong&gt;, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-43--sardius-jasper-emerald&#34;&gt;Rev 4:3- Sardius, Jasper, Emerald&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The One sitting there gleamed like diamonds (jasper) and rubies (carnelian/sardius), and a rainbow shining like an emerald encircled the throne.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keener noted that John&amp;rsquo;s simple description of the throne room deliberately contrasted with the Roman emperor&amp;rsquo;s pompous display of power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The original audience would have recognized the carnelian (aka sardius), jasper, and emerald stones as being from the breastplate of the High Priest.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Exodus 28:15-20 “You shall make a breastpiece of judgment, in skilled work. In the style of the ephod you shall make it—of gold, blue and purple and scarlet yarns, and fine twined linen shall you make it. (16) It shall be square and doubled, a span its length and a span its breadth. (17) You shall set in it four rows of stones. A row of &lt;strong&gt;sardius&lt;/strong&gt;, topaz, and carbuncle shall be the first row; (18) and the second row an &lt;strong&gt;emerald&lt;/strong&gt;, a sapphire, and a diamond; (19) and the third row a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; (20) and the fourth row a beryl, an onyx, and a &lt;strong&gt;jasper&lt;/strong&gt;. They shall be set in gold filigree.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were 12 stones arranged in the birth order of the 12 tribes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sardius&lt;/strong&gt; = Reuben (1st Born) and &lt;strong&gt;jasper&lt;/strong&gt; = Benjamin (last born)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is another way of saying &amp;ldquo;from A to Z&amp;rdquo; in other words all the 12 tribes were represented by the One who was sitting on the Throne, not just Reuben and Benjamin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we know this, the fact that the emerald appears preeminent should not surprise us.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emerald&lt;/strong&gt; was the fourth stone = Judah (4th born)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judah held the status of &amp;ldquo;Firstborn&amp;rdquo; because Reuben, Simeon, and Levi all forfeited the right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note Stern&amp;rsquo;s CJB translation of the first two stones as generic &amp;ldquo;diamonds and rubies&amp;rdquo; is odd; the Greek specifically identifies these stones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ezekiel saw similar precious gems in the throneroom of God
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ezekiel 1:26-28 And above the expanse over their heads there was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like sapphire; and seated above the likeness of a throne was a likeness with a human appearance. (27) And upward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were gleaming metal, like the appearance of fire enclosed all around. And downward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness around him. (28) Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around. Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard the voice of one speaking.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note Ezekiel didn&amp;rsquo;t see God directly. He saw an &amp;ldquo;appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD&amp;rdquo;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-44-24-elders&#34;&gt;Rev 4:4-24 Elders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on the thrones sat twenty-four elders dressed in white clothing and wearing gold crowns on their heads.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thrones, white clothing, and crowns are distinguishing characteristics of promises to the overcomers in Rev 2 &amp;amp; 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are many conjectures as to who these 24 elders are.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most importantly John does not tell us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The earthly office of Elder (&lt;em&gt;presbuteros&lt;/em&gt;) is the highest official in an assembly (Titus 1:5; Acts 15:6, 1 Pet 2:5,9). Therefore many see the elders as representative of the &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; at large.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As Revelation 4 is about Temple service, one possible explanation is to remember that David organized the Levitical priesthood into 24 courses or divisions.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These divisions represented all of Israel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;1 Chronicles 24:3b, 18 David organized them according to the appointed duties in their service…the &lt;strong&gt;twenty-fourth&lt;/strong&gt; to Maaziah&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we remember, Zechariah, John the Baptist&amp;rsquo;s father, was from the course of Abijah (Luke 1:5, 8), in other words, the eighth course (1 Chr 24:10).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each course would serve two weeks out of the year (some sources imply one week, twice a year) and then would go back to work their trade and be with their families the rest of the year, just as Zechariah did (Luke 1:23).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This speculation would seem to fit with the model of the Camp of Israel from Numbers 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Levites formed the inner box and the 12 tribes formed the outer.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss support for the 12 tribes forming the outer box at verse 7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many scholars do not see the Levitical priesthood continuing in Heaven. While I find this somewhat unlikely, non-Levitical priesthoods are attested to in Scripture
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jethro: &lt;small&gt;Exo 3:1 Now Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law, Jethro, the priest of Midian, and he led his flock to the west side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melchizedek: &lt;small&gt;Gen 14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. (He was priest of God Most High.) &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Us: &lt;small&gt; 1 Pet_2:9 But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.&lt;/small&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many commentators infer that of the 24, 12 are the representatives of the 12 tribes, and the other 12 are the 12 apostles.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is nothing but conjecture to support this view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One possible counterargument is that Jesus said the Apostles would rule OVER the 12 tribes, not alongside them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heiser suggests these are deified believers.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot; Heaven and earth, divinity and humanity, are not easily separable when it comes to the divine council and God’s plan for restoration of Eden.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In terms of heavenly elders, the only other reference appears in Isaiah.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Isaiah 24:23 Then the moon will be confounded and the sun ashamed, for the LORD of hosts reigns on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and his glory will be before his elders. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 24 elders of Revelation will appear in 4:10, 5:8, 11:16, and 19:4, each time worshipping God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;crowns&#34;&gt;Crowns&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the extent that these elders could be representatives of Jewish or non-Jewish believers, note that any believer may obtain different crowns for different acts of service and devotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crown of life for those who love Him and suffer for His sake (Jas 1:12, Rev 2:10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crown of righteousness for those who loved his appearing (2 Tim 4:8)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crown of glory for those who feed the flock (1 Pet 5:4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crown incorruptible for those who persevere (1 Cor 9:25)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crown of rejoicing for those who win souls (1 Thes 2:19)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the &amp;ldquo;Bema seat&amp;rdquo; rewards for those whose works survived the judgment (gold, silver, precious stones, vs wood, hay, stubble 1 Cor 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-45-thunder&#34;&gt;Rev 4:5-Thunder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;From the throne came forth lightnings, voices, and thunderings; and before the throne were seven flaming torches, which are the sevenfold Spirit of God&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;special effects&amp;rdquo; if we can call them that, seem to be recalling the giving of the Torah at Mt. Sinai (or perhaps it’s the other way around! Perhaps the display at Mount Sinai was a type and shadow of the Heavenly throne room).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Exo 19:16 Then it came to pass on the third day, in the morning, that there were &lt;strong&gt;thunderings&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;lightnings&lt;/strong&gt;, and a thick cloud on the mountain; and the sound of the trumpet was &lt;strong&gt;very loud,&lt;/strong&gt; so that all the people who were in the camp trembled.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ezekiel saw and heard similarly.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ezekiel 1:4 As I looked, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, and a great cloud, with brightness around it, and &lt;strong&gt;fire&lt;/strong&gt; flashing forth continually, and in the midst of the &lt;strong&gt;fire&lt;/strong&gt;, as it were gleaming metal. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ezekiel 3:12 Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the &lt;strong&gt;voice&lt;/strong&gt; of a great earthquake: “Blessed be the glory of the LORD from its place!” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;shavuotpentecost&#34;&gt;Shavuot/Pentecost&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Christians don&amp;rsquo;t realize that Acts 2 is a virtual carbon copy of the Giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. The Jewish feast of Shavuot is the day, according to tradition, that the Torah was given to Moses. The same day on the Jewish calendar, the day we call Pentecost, is the day the Spirit was poured out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Act 2:1-3 When the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. (2) And suddenly there came a &lt;strong&gt;sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house&lt;/strong&gt; where they were sitting. (3) Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of &lt;strong&gt;fire&lt;/strong&gt;, and one sat upon each of them. (4) And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-46sea-of-crystal&#34;&gt;Rev 4:6–Sea of Crystal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;In front of the throne was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. In the center, around the throne, were four living beings covered with eyes in front and behind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the heavenly temple, there is a counterpart to the molten sea.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;1 Kings 7:23-25 Then he made the &lt;strong&gt;sea of cast metal&lt;/strong&gt;. It was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference. (24) Under its brim were gourds, for ten cubits, compassing the sea all around. The gourds were in two rows, cast with it when it was cast. (25) It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The sea was set on them, and all their rear parts were inward.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was for ceremonial purification so that those in service could be ritually pure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One suggestion is the sea is now crystal because no further purification is needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In terms of the heavenly temple, John will also see an altar of incense (5:8) an altar of sacrifice (6:9), and the ark itself (11:19) all components of the earthly temple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Sea of glass or crystal that John say represents the firmament Ezekiel saw.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Eze 1:22 The likeness of the &lt;strong&gt;firmament&lt;/strong&gt; above the heads of the living creatures was like the color of an awesome &lt;strong&gt;crystal&lt;/strong&gt;, stretched out over their heads. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We first encounter the &amp;ldquo;firmament&amp;rdquo; in Genesis 1.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Gen 1:6-8 Then God said, &amp;ldquo;Let there be a &lt;strong&gt;firmament&lt;/strong&gt; in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.&amp;rdquo; (7) Thus God made the &lt;strong&gt;firmament&lt;/strong&gt;, and divided the waters which were under the &lt;strong&gt;firmament&lt;/strong&gt; from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so. (8) And God called the &lt;strong&gt;firmament&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Heaven&lt;/strong&gt;. So the evening and the morning were the second day.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;four-living-creatures&#34;&gt;Four Living Creatures&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some translations have &amp;ldquo;four beasts&amp;rdquo; – this is unfortunate. The Greek word is &lt;em&gt;Zoa&lt;/em&gt;, which is simply a living being as opposed to a sinister, voracious creature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eyes
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Eze_10:12 And their whole body, their rims, and their spokes, their wings, and the wheels were full of eyes all around—the wheels that the four of them had.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eyes all around denote perfect vision, i.e., omniscience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where is God? He&amp;rsquo;s on His heavenly throne watching us and testing us!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Psa 11:4 The LORD is in His holy temple, The LORD&amp;rsquo;s throne is in heaven; &lt;strong&gt;His eyes behold, His eyelids test the sons of men. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-47-lion-ox-man-eagle&#34;&gt;Rev 4:7-Lion, Ox, Man, Eagle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The first living being was like a lion, the second living being was like an ox, the third living being had a face that looked human, and the fourth living being was like a flying eagle&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The four living creatures have a direct parallel to Ezekiel
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ezekiel 1:5-11 (5) And from the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had a human likeness, (6) but each had four faces, and each of them had four wings. (7) Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf&amp;rsquo;s foot. And they sparkled like burnished bronze. (8) Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. And the four had their faces and their wings thus: (9) their wings touched one another. Each one of them went straight forward, without turning as they went. (10) As for the likeness of their faces, each had a &lt;strong&gt;human&lt;/strong&gt; face. The four had the face of a &lt;strong&gt;lion&lt;/strong&gt; on the right side, the four had the face of an &lt;strong&gt;ox&lt;/strong&gt; on the left side, and the four had the face of an &lt;strong&gt;eagle&lt;/strong&gt;. (11) Such were their faces. And their wings were spread out above. Each creature had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while two covered their bodies.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing our Numbers 2 discussion, each of the 12 tribes (minus Levi but with Joseph split into Ephraim and Manasseh), was organized into four camps, with one tribe named as the standard-bearer for the camp.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun were under the standard of Judah;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reuben, Simeon, and Gad were in the camp of Reuben and so forth with Ephraim and Dan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can see this in the image above.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an aside, it&amp;rsquo;s fascinating that when we align the tribes roughly proportionally with their population we get the shape of a cross.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Jewish tradition (inferred from passages like Genesis 49) , each standard had an image. Later sages have observed the characteristic of each image. This is in parenthesis below.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judah = Lion (the most exalted non-domesticated creation)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ephraim = Ox (the most exalted domesticated creation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reuben = Man (the most exalted creation; given dominion over all)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dan = Eagle (the most exalted bird)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So, just as we had the 24 divisions of the Levites around the inner circle, we have the standards of each of the four camps surrounding the throne in the heavenly tabernacle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the Christian Era, these same images became attached to each of the four gospels, though interestingly the application of the creatures to the gospels has not been consistent over the last 2000 years. Here is the current application
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matthew – Jesus is the Son of David, the Lion of the tribe of Judah – genealogy goes back to Abraham the first Hebrew/Jew – Lion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark = Jesus came to serve – Mark has no genealogy because we aren&amp;rsquo;t interested in the pedigree of a servant – Ox, the ultimate service animal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luke = Jesus is the Son of Man – genealogy back to Adam, the first man – Man&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John – the Son of God – genealogy of the pre-existent One (In the beginning was the Word) - Eagle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-48-holy-holy-holy&#34;&gt;Rev 4:8-Holy, Holy, Holy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Each of the four living beings had six wings and was covered with eyes inside and out; and day and night they never stop saying, &amp;ldquo;Holy, holy, holy is Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies the One who was, who is and who is coming!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Isaiah 6:2-3 Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. 3 And one called to another and said: “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-49-he-reigns&#34;&gt;Rev 4:9-He Reigns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;And whenever the living beings give glory, honor, and thanks to the One sitting on the throne, to the One who lives forever and ever,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Exodus 15: 18 The LORD will reign forever and ever. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-410-11-he-is-worthy&#34;&gt;Rev 4:10-11-He is Worthy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;the twenty-four elders fall down before the One sitting on the throne, who lives forever and ever, and worship him. They throw their crowns in front of the throne and say,&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;You are worthy, Adonai Eloheinu, to have glory, honor and power, because you created all things—yes, because of your will they were created and came into being!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;1 Chr 29: 11 Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all. 12 Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all. In your hand are power and might, and in your hand it is to make great and to give strength to all. 13 And now we thank you, our God, and praise your glorious name. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this was a tour-de-force of Bible References. Remember one of the blessings of Studying Revelation is exposure to virtually every other book in the Bible. There is blessing in studying and obeying His word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;

Heiser, &lt;em&gt;The Unseen Realm: Recovering the Supernatural Worldview of the Bible&lt;/em&gt;, First edition (Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press, 2015), 354.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also predicated on the assumption that, for example, when Judah is told to camp to the east, they were prohibited from being northeast or southeast. They could only be due east. Ephraim could only be due west, not northwest or southwest, and so forth. This is probably a fair assumption, otherwise both Judah and Reuben could technically have occupied the area to the southeast, at which point common sense would tell us that at least one of the tribes would have been in the wrong position.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5:1 Next I saw in the right hand of the One sitting on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals; (2) and I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?&amp;rdquo; (3) But no one in heaven, on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or look inside it. (4) I cried and cried, because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look inside it. (5) One of the elders said to me, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t cry. Look, the Lion of the tribe of Y&amp;rsquo;hudah, the Root of David, has won the right to open the scroll and its seven seals.&amp;rdquo; (6) Then I saw standing there with the throne and the four living beings, in the circle of the elders, a Lamb that appeared to have been slaughtered. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the sevenfold Spirit of God sent out into all the earth. (7) He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of the One sitting on the throne. (8) When he took the scroll, the four living beings and the twenty-four elders fell down in front of the Lamb. Each one held a harp and gold bowls filled with pieces of incense, which are the prayers of God&amp;rsquo;s people; (9) and they sang a new song, &amp;ldquo;You are worthy to take the scroll and break its seals; because you were slaughtered; at the cost of blood you ransomed for God persons from every tribe, language, people and nation. (10) You made them into a kingdom for God to rule, cohanim to serve him; and they will rule over the earth.&amp;rdquo; (11) Then I looked, and I heard the sound of a vast number of angels—thousands and thousands, millions and millions! They were all around the throne, the living beings and the elders; (12) and they shouted out, &amp;ldquo;Worthy is the slaughtered Lamb to receive power, riches, wisdom, strength, honor, glory and praise!&amp;rdquo; (13) And I heard every creature in heaven, on earth, under the earth and on the sea—yes, everything in them—saying, &amp;ldquo;To the One sitting on the throne and to the Lamb belong praise, honor, glory and power forever and ever!&amp;rdquo; (14) The four living beings said, &amp;ldquo;Amen!&amp;rdquo; and the elders fell down and worshipped.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-51&#34;&gt;Rev 5:1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next I saw in the right hand of the One sitting on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A seal would have been made of clay (later, wax) with an imprint of authentication
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem, many documents were destroyed, leaving only the clay seals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hundreds of these seals have been found all over Israel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are called LMLK (l&amp;rsquo;melech – to the king)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes they would be tied with a string, with the clay or wax molded around the string – to get to the string, one would need to break the seal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seals still intact let the bearer know that the contents were not altered
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, not added or deleted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Rev 22:18-19 I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, (19) and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This scene resembles when the Torah was given to Moses
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Exo 32:15-16 Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets that were &lt;strong&gt;written on both sides; on the front and on the back they were written&lt;/strong&gt;. (16) The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is also descriptive of legal documents of the ancient world.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keener notes that many such documents had seven seals, which guaranteed no one had open or tampered with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider this passage from Jeremiah:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Jer 32:9-15 “And I bought the field at Anathoth from Hanamel my cousin, and weighed out the money to him, seventeen shekels of silver. (10) I signed the deed, sealed it, got witnesses, and weighed the money on scales. (11) Then I took the sealed deed of purchase, containing the terms and conditions and the open copy. (12) And I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my cousin, in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, and in the presence of all the Judeans who were sitting in the court of the guard. (13) I charged Baruch in their presence, saying, (14) ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, both this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware vessel, that they may last for a long time. (15) For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.’&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The writing on the outside likely provided the terms and conditions for breaking the seals.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ezek 2:9 And when I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me, and behold, a scroll of a book was in it. 10 And he spread it before me. And it had writing on the front and on the back, and there were written on it words of lamentation and mourning and woe. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Zechariah 5:1 Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, a flying scroll! 2 And he said to me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a flying scroll. Its length is twenty cubits, and its width ten cubits.” 3 Then he said to me, “This is the curse that goes out over the face of the whole land. For everyone who steals shall be cleaned out according to what is on one side, and everyone who swears falsely shall be cleaned out according to what is on the other side. 4 I will send it out, declares the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter the house of the thief, and the house of him who swears falsely by my name. And it shall remain in his house and consume it, both timber and stones.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the same &amp;ldquo;Ancient of Days&amp;rdquo; seated on his throne that Daniel and Isaiah saw.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Dan 7:9 “As I looked, thrones were placed, and the Ancient of Days took his seat; his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames; its wheels were burning fire. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Isa 6:1 In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rest of Revelation will describe what happens as the seven seals are removed and the scroll opened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chuck Missler refers to this scroll as the &amp;ldquo;title deed to Earth&amp;rdquo;, and this chapter is &amp;ldquo;the most important escrow closing in history.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other commentators see the &amp;ldquo;Book of Life&amp;rdquo; mentioned in Psalm 139:6, Exodus 32:32, and Revelation 3:5.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Exo 32:32-33 But now, if you will forgive their sin—but if not, please blot me out of your book that you have written.” (33) But the LORD said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me, I will blot out of my book.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-52-4&#34;&gt;Rev 5:2-4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?&amp;rdquo; But no one in heaven, on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or look inside it. I cried and cried, because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look inside it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John apparently has an inkling that this is an extremely important document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A question might be why the One seated on the throne is not worthy
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently, it required a &lt;strong&gt;man&lt;/strong&gt; to open it but, apparently, no &lt;strong&gt;man&lt;/strong&gt; matching the qualifications could be identified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Is 29:1 And the vision of all this has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed. When men give it to one who can read, saying, “Read this,” he says, “I cannot, for it is sealed.”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Dan 12:9 He said, “Go your way, Daniel, for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of the end. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation 5 is a partial fulfillment of these passages that were once sealed but are now about to be unsealed.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lizorkin writes, &amp;ldquo;This vision could be completely original to John but reads a little like an adaptation of both Daniel 7, Ezekiel 2 (and possibly) Isaiah 29.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The book of Ruth provides an example of a kinsman-redeemer, which most scholars believe is essentially what is happening in Revelation 5.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boaz, the goel, the kinsman-Redeemer had to meet the following conditions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had to be a kinsman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had to be able and willing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had to assume all of the obligations of the beneficiary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John weeps because no such redeemer for this particular contract is apparent.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greek has two different words for crying;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One is more of sobbing and is the word used when Jesus wept over the death of Lazarus (John 11:35)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other implies being overcome with grief, as when Jesus wept over Jerusalem (Luke 19:41)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stronger word is used here in Rev 5:4. John was overcome with grief.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is reminiscent of Daniel 7, where Daniel became physically ill
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Dan 7:28 “Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly alarmed me, and my color changed, but I kept the matter in my heart.”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We might find it curious that John did not identify Jesus, the one who loved him, as someone who would have met the terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember, John is receiving this in a vision; in other words, in his vision, he sees himself weeping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He weeps because the fate of God&amp;rsquo;s redemptive program hangs in the balance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All throughout the bible, we see Satan trying to thwart the plan of God.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples are the Garden of Eden, the Tower of Babel, the attempts to wipe out Judah&amp;rsquo;s and later David&amp;rsquo;s line, Jesus&#39; temptations, and ultimately the Cross.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a moment, John is terrified that Satan had succeeded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-55&#34;&gt;Rev 5:5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the elders said to me, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t cry. Look, the Lion of the tribe of Y&amp;rsquo;hudah, the Root of David, has won the right to open the scroll and its seven seals.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are all Jewish titles
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-trib dispensationalists (e.g. Missler) note the 24 titles used of Jesus in chapters 1-3 apply to Him in His role as revealed to the church. From Chapter 4 on in Revelation, only Jewish titles are used, suggesting a distinction between Israel and the Church&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opponents of this viewpoint would cite Roman&amp;rsquo;s 11 where gentiles are &amp;ldquo;grafted-in&amp;rdquo; to Israel, as a suggestion that there is no such thing as a different dispensation called &amp;ldquo;the church age.&amp;rdquo; We are one body, in which there is neither Jew nor Gentile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that both of these camps at least deny Replacement Theology by recognizing Israel&amp;rsquo;s place in God&amp;rsquo;s program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lion of the tribe of Judah
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Gen 49:9 Judah is a lion&amp;rsquo;s cub; from the prey, my son, you have gone up. He stooped down; he crouched as a lion and as a lioness; who dares rouse him? The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler&amp;rsquo;s staff from between his feet, until tribute (or &amp;ldquo;Shiloh&amp;rdquo;) comes to him; and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewish sages have long interpreted this as a prophecy of the Messiah&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;scepter&amp;rdquo; was viewed as the ability of the nation to carry out capital punishment.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josephus records that when Herod Archelaus was deposed around 6 or 7 AD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At some point after this, the Romans took away the Jews&#39; authority to carry out capital punishment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Talmud records weeping, saying &amp;ldquo;Woe unto us for the scepter has departed from Judah and the Messiah has not come!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They believed the word of God had failed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This adds new significance to Luke 2 where Jesus publicly presented himself at the temple at age 12, most likely BEFORE the Sanhedrin was stripped of this power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Root of David
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This terminology comes from Isaiah 11, which describes Messiah as a root of Jessie, king David&amp;rsquo;s father.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah 11 also describes a messianic peace, where Gentiles and a regathered Israel will dwell together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Isaiah 11:1 There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isa 11:10-12 In that day the root of Jesse, who shall stand as a signal for the peoples—of him shall the nations (i.e., &amp;ldquo;gentiles&amp;rdquo;) inquire, and his resting (or &amp;ldquo;dwelling&amp;rdquo;) place shall be glorious. (11) In that day the Lord will extend his hand yet a second time to recover the remnant that remains of his people (Israel), from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the coastlands of the sea. (12) He will raise a signal for the nations and will assemble the banished of Israel, and gather the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is why Matthew and Luke MUST establish Jesus&#39; connection to David. Everything hinges upon it
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mat 1:1 The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Luk 1:31-33 And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. (32) He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, (33) and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By His perfect obedience in life and death, Jesus won the victory over our sin and won the right to open the seals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-56&#34;&gt;Rev 5:6&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then I saw standing there with (in the midst of) the throne and the four living beings, in the circle of the elders, a Lamb that appeared to have been slaughtered. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the sevenfold Spirit of God sent out into all the earth&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lamb as it has been slaughtered
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is reminiscent of the Passover sacrifice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Exo 12:21 Then Moses called all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go and select lambs for yourselves according to your clans, and kill the Passover lamb.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The original Passover sacrifice spared the people from the plague
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Exo 12:13 The blood shall be a sign for you, on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague will befall you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the same way, this Lamb will save His people from the plagues that are to come as we progress through revelation.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HOW God chooses to preserve His people is up to Him (maybe rapture, maybe martyrdom, maybe some other form of preservation).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus didn&amp;rsquo;t get a pass from death
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure we should expect a pass through the rapture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember, many of the promises to the overcomers in Chapters 1-3 will happen after our earthly deaths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The famous &amp;ldquo;suffering servant&amp;rdquo; passage of Isaiah 53 also contains a reference to a lamb to be slaughtered (Isa 53:7-8).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John the Baptist described Jesus as the &amp;ldquo;Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world,&amp;rdquo; a remarkable comment as Jesus had not yet been sacrificed (John 1:29).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Jesus institutes Holy Communion, He did so at a Passover seder. The connection of His blood with the Passover Lamb&amp;rsquo;s blood would have been unmistakable for the disciples.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I encourage us all, whenever we hear a reference to being saved by the Blood of Christ, to say to ourselves, &amp;ldquo;oh, just like the Passover Lamb&amp;rsquo;s blood saved the Israelites in Egypt.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A study of the Passover feast, even as it is practiced today, is incredibly worthwhile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that a powerful lion and a slaughtered lamb are just about as opposite as two creatures can be; yet, Jesus is both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put yourself in the position of the early 1st Century followers of Jesus.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which &amp;ldquo;Jesus&amp;rdquo; would you have wanted: the Lion or the Lamb?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be honest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you begin to understand how the Jews of Jesus&#39; day thought this couldn&amp;rsquo;t be the same person? There must be two messiahs.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messiah ben Joseph – suffering lamb (which became allegorized as suffering Israel)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messiah ben David – conquering lion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seven Horns, i.e., all-powerful
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horns are a symbol of authority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Psa 75:4-5 I say to the boastful, ‘Do not boast,’ and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horn; (5) do not lift up your horn on high, or speak with haughty neck.’”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus references this power in the Great Commission
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mat 28:18 And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I suspect the &amp;ldquo;Father&amp;rdquo; handing the &amp;ldquo;Son&amp;rdquo; the scroll in the next symbolizes this authority-sharing arrangement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seven Eyes, i.e., all-seeing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Zec 3:9&lt;/strong&gt; For behold, on the stone that I have set before Joshua (the high priest), on a single stone with &lt;strong&gt;seven eyes&lt;/strong&gt;, I will engrave its inscription, declares the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of this land in a single day.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zec 4:10&lt;/strong&gt; For whoever has despised the day of small things shall rejoice, and shall see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. “These &lt;strong&gt;seven&lt;/strong&gt; are the &lt;strong&gt;eyes of the LORD, which range through the whole earth&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sevenfold spirit
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some scholars (including Lancaster) believe the sevenfold spirit is not what we think of as the Holy Spirit, but are the image of the traditional seven archangels of Judaism (Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, Uriel, Saraqael, Raguel, and Remiel).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although cited in the apocryphal Book of Enoch, possible support for this view may be seen at Rev 8:2: &lt;small&gt;Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is perhaps an even deeper significance to John&amp;rsquo;s referencing one who was slaughtered.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As is the case today, a will can only be executed upon the death of the person in question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keener writes, &amp;ldquo;If a (type of) will in in view here, it is significant that it is the lamb &lt;strong&gt;who had been slain&lt;/strong&gt; who is worthy to open it.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep in mind that seven times, Paul used the word &amp;ldquo;inheritance&amp;rdquo; to describe a reward for faithfully serving Jesus the Messiah.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Eph 1:11 In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Col 3:24 knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-57-8&#34;&gt;Rev 5:7-8&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of the One sitting on the throne. When he took the scroll, the four living beings and the twenty-four elders fell down in front of the Lamb. Each one held a harp and gold bowls filled with pieces of incense, which are the prayers of God&amp;rsquo;s people;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One like a son of man approaching the Ancient of Days
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Dan 7:13-14 “I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. (14) And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again, this reminds us that we need to hold to &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; understanding of the Trinity very loosely.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus is equal in power and glory to the Father (in other words, Jesus is not a &amp;ldquo;lesser&amp;rdquo; God), yet in some way, He is subordinate and submissive to the Father.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bradford sees a comparison between Messiah receiving the scroll from the Father and Moses receiving the tablets from the Father.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;A prophet like unto Moses&amp;rdquo; was promised&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Deu 18:15 “The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your brothers—it is to him you shall listen.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We may miss what is going on, but the elders and the four living beings did not!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People in the Bible who bow to angels and other servants of the LORD are usually rebuked.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is one angel who made an exception and he&amp;rsquo;s in a lot of trouble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are bowing because this is not just any &amp;ldquo;one like a son of man,&amp;rdquo; this is God the Son who is taking the scroll from God the Father.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harp
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;1Ch 25:1 David and the chiefs of the service also set apart for the service the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who prophesied with lyres, with harps, and with cymbals. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walton notes that music played an important role in receiving an oracle.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prayers/Incense
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Psa 141:2 Let my prayer be counted as incense before you, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Rev 8:3-4 And another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer, and he was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne, (4) and the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before God from the hand of the angel.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-59-10&#34;&gt;Rev 5:9-10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and they sang a new song, &amp;ldquo;You are worthy to take the scroll and break its seals; because you were slaughtered; at the cost of blood you ransomed for God persons from every tribe, language, people and nation. You made them into a kingdom for God to rule, cohanim to serve him; and they will rule over the earth.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New song
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Isa 42:9-12 Behold, the former things have come to pass, and new things I now declare; before they spring forth I tell you of them.” (10) Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise from the end of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that fills it, the coastlands and their inhabitants. (11) Let the desert and its cities lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar inhabits; let the habitants of Sela sing for joy, let them shout from the top of the mountains. (12) Let them give glory to the LORD, and declare his praise in the coastlands.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several times in the Psalms, such as &lt;small&gt; Psa 33:3 Sing to him a new song; play skillfully on the strings, with loud shouts. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blood
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To recap the discussion above, by the blood of the Passover lamb, God delivered the Israelites from bondage to be a kingdom and a priesthood to serve Him and rule the nation.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the blood of Jesus, the Lamb of God, He delivered us from bondage to be a kingdom and a priesthood to serve Him and rule over the earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kingdom
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Exo 19:4-6 ‘You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles&#39; wings and brought you to myself. (5) Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; (6) and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Daniel 7:18 But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, forever and ever.’ &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Daniel 7:27 And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;1 Pe 2:9 But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember, the original congregations receiving Revelation were exiled in a thoroughly pagan environment and were suffering varying degrees of persecution.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This passage would remind them that the heavenly congregation stood in solidarity with them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The members of the earthly fellowships will one day rule over the earth despite their present situation which was exactly the opposite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Dead Sea Scrolls contain similar imagery of earthly worshippers envisioning themselves participating in heavenly worship with angels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This vision broke with other Jewish apocalyptic literature which described Israel as inheriting the kingdom and ruling over the nations.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John&amp;rsquo;s revelation has Gentile as well as Jewish believers inheriting and ruling over the nations in the Age to Come.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is represented by the &amp;ldquo;millions and millions&amp;rdquo; in verse 11.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-511-12&#34;&gt;Rev 5:11-12&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then I looked, and I heard the sound of a vast number of angels—thousands and thousands, millions and millions! They were all around the throne, the living beings, and the elders; and they shouted out, &amp;ldquo;Worthy is the slaughtered Lamb to receive power, riches, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and praise!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ten thousands
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Deut 33:2 He said, “The LORD came from Sinai and dawned from Seir upon us; he shone forth from Mount Paran; he came from the ten thousands of holy ones, with flaming fire at his right hand.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the CJB, Stern paraphrases the underlying Greek, which, literally is &amp;ldquo;ten thousands of ten thousands,&amp;rdquo; which is an idiom meaning &amp;ldquo;innumerable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel 7:14 is also in view: &lt;small&gt;&amp;ldquo;all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him&amp;rdquo;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We shouldn&amp;rsquo;t lose sight of the groups of seven, even when the number &amp;ldquo;seven&amp;rdquo; is not enumerated. Note the group of seven praises in verse 12.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-513-14&#34;&gt;Rev 5:13-14&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And I heard every creature in heaven, on earth, under the earth and on the sea—yes, everything in them—saying, &amp;ldquo;To the One sitting on the throne and to the Lamb belong praise, honor, glory and power forever and ever!&amp;rdquo; The four living beings said, &amp;ldquo;Amen!&amp;rdquo; and the elders fell down and worshipped.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every knee shall bow –
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Isa 45:23 By myself I have sworn; from my mouth has gone out in righteousness a word that shall not return: ‘To me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear allegiance.’&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also quoted by Paul in Romans 14:11 and Philippians 2:9-11.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Amen&amp;rdquo; אָמֵן is the one Hebrew word EVERYBODY in almost EVERY LANGUAGE knows!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul exhorts us to remember Jesus in His glorified state
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Php 2:5-11 &lt;strong&gt;Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus&lt;/strong&gt;, (6) who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, (7) but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. (8) And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. (9) Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, (10) so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, (11) and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could ask, &amp;ldquo;Is your Jesus the one still hanging on a cross, or is your Jesus the one, the only one, who is worthy to take the scroll and be worshipped?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now the scene will shift to the physical realm on earth. Many would view this as the &amp;ldquo;Day of the Lord&amp;rdquo;, which is not just a day on the calendar but a period of seven years prophesied by Daniel in Daniel 9.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read/hear the portions&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rev 6:1-17 Next, I watched as the Lamb broke the first of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living beings say in a thundering voice, &amp;ldquo;Go!&amp;rdquo; (2) I looked, and there in front of me was a white horse; its rider had a bow and was given a crown, and he rode off as a conqueror to conquer. (3) When he broke the second seal, I heard the second living being say, &amp;ldquo;Go!&amp;rdquo; (4) Another horse went out, a red one; and its rider was given the power to take peace away from the earth and make people slaughter each other. He was given a great sword. (5) When he broke the third seal, I heard the third living being say, &amp;ldquo;Go!&amp;rdquo; I looked, and there in front of me was a black horse, and its rider held in his hand a pair of scales. (6) Then I heard what sounded like a voice from among the four living beings say, &amp;ldquo;Two pounds of wheat for a day&amp;rsquo;s wages! Six pounds of barley for the same price! But don&amp;rsquo;t damage the oil or the wine!&amp;rdquo; (7) When he broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living being say, &amp;ldquo;Go!&amp;rdquo; (8) I looked, and there in front of me was a pallid, sickly-looking horse. Its rider&amp;rsquo;s name was Death, and Sh&amp;rsquo;ol followed behind him. They were given authority to kill one-quarter of the world by war, by famine, by plagues and with the wild animals of the earth. (9) When the Lamb broke the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been put to death for proclaiming the Word of God, that is, for bearing witness. (10) They cried out in a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;Sovereign Ruler, HaKadosh, the True One, how long will it be before you judge the people living on earth and avenge our blood?&amp;rdquo; (11) Each of them was given a white robe; and they were told to wait a little longer, until the full number of their fellow-servants should be reached, of their brothers who would be killed, just as they had been. (12) Then I watched as he broke the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake, the sun turned black as sackcloth worn in mourning, and the full moon became blood-red. (13) The stars fell from heaven to earth just as a fig tree drops its figs when shaken by a strong wind. (14) The sky receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place. (15) Then the earth&amp;rsquo;s kings, the rulers, the generals, the rich and the mighty—indeed, everyone, slave and free—hid himself in caves and among the rocks in the mountains, (16) and said to the mountains and rocks, &amp;ldquo;Fall on us, and hide us from the face of the One sitting on the throne and from the fury of the Lamb! (17) For the Great Day of their fury has come, and who can stand?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;four-horseman-of-the-apocalypse&#34;&gt;Four Horseman of the Apocalypse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The beginning of the woes that will unfold throughout the rest of the book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talmud discusses a seven-year period of calamity followed by the establishment of the Messianic kingdom. There is a general expectation that before the coming of the Messiah, there will be a period of tribulation leading up to the final redemption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation has echoes of Exodus and the plagues on Egypt, with the deliverance of God&amp;rsquo;s people through the plagues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horsemen imagery appears twice in Zechariah
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Zec 1:8-11 “I saw in the night, and behold, a man riding on a red horse! He was standing among the myrtle trees in the glen, and behind him were red sorrel, and white horses. (9) Then I said, ‘What are these, my lord?’ The angel who talked with me said to me, ‘I will show you what they are.’ (10) So the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, ‘These are they whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.’ (11) And they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees, and said, ‘We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth remains at rest.’&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Zec 6:1-8 Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains. And the mountains were mountains of bronze. (2) The first chariot had red horses, the second black horses, (3) the third white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses—all of them strong. (4) Then I answered and said to the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” (5) And the angel answered and said to me, “These are going out to the four winds of heaven (cf. Rev 7:1), after presenting themselves before the Lord of all the earth. (6) The chariot with the black horses goes toward the north country, the white ones go after them, and the dappled ones go toward the south country.” (7) When the strong horses came out, they were impatient to go and patrol the earth. And he said, “Go, patrol the earth.” So they patrolled the earth. (8) Then he cried to me, “Behold, those who go toward the north country have set my Spirit at rest in the north country.”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both passages describe members of the divine council sent out to patrol the earth and report back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most ancient cultures had legends of divine judgments such as war and famine.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indeed, Jesus predicted these in the Olivet Discourse:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mat 24:6-8 And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet. (7) For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. (8) All these are but the beginning of the birth pains.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a sense, all four horsemen (plus the 5th seal of martyrdom) have been at work throughout human history, particularly in the 20th century.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hence, the comparison to a woman in labor, with increasing contractions.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus says not to be alarmed, (24:6), but instead, we need to get excited!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Luke 21:28 Now when these things begin to take place, straighten up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-61-first-seal&#34;&gt;Rev 6:1 First Seal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Next I watched as the Lamb broke the first of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living beings say in a thundering voice, &amp;ldquo;Go!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An interesting point is that the horsemen are not part of the document itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The document cannot be opened and read until all the seals are broken (i.e. after the seventh seal is broken in Revelation 8:1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some interpret the document as the redemption of man and earth, but just like the redemption of Israel from Egypt, judgment, and deliverance from the oppressors was required first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember, Jesus is opening the seals in front of the Elders, the four living creatures and &amp;ldquo;millions and millions&amp;rdquo;, perhaps suggesting the heavenly witnesses mentioned in Deuteronomy and Psalms.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deu 30:19&lt;/strong&gt; I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Therefore choose life, that you and your offspring may live,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psa 50:4&lt;/strong&gt; He calls to the heavens above and to the earth, that he may judge his people:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missler pointed out that when the elders speak, the subject is heaven but when the living creatures speak, the subject is earth.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster adds, saying that the command could be translated as &amp;ldquo;Come!&amp;rdquo;, meaning come down from the heavenly realm and go down to earth.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-62-white&#34;&gt;Rev 6:2 White&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I looked, and there in front of me was a white horse; its rider had a bow and was given a crown; and he rode off as a conqueror to conquer.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential anti-Roman imagery here.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The biggest threat to the Roman Empire was the Parthians, who were known as being hyper-skilled in archery and, according to Keener, they typically rode white horses
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may have heard the phrase &amp;ldquo;the Parthian shot&amp;rdquo; (aka the &amp;lsquo;parting&amp;rsquo; shot).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Parthians could bring down a bird in flight, right or left-handed, even while facing backward on a horse at full gallop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Wikipedia, the stirrup had not yet been invented, so this was all leg and core strength.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When they shot at their enemies while retreating or faking a retreat, it became known as the Parthian Shot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somewhere along the line, this got misunderstood as a &amp;ldquo;parting&amp;rdquo; shot, which still fits as a metaphor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an aside, one reason Herod and all Jerusalem &amp;ldquo;was in an uproar&amp;rdquo; in Matthew 2:3 could have been that they suspected the visit of the eastern Magi was the beginning of a Parthian invasion (three guys on camels would not have caused this fear).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;identity-of-rider&#34;&gt;Identity of Rider?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some commentators see Jesus here as the man with the crown on a white horse.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As Missler says, &amp;ldquo;This guy keeps bad company (the other three horses). Christ is opening the seals; He is not inside them.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some other commentators say this is the gospel message going out. This is also unlikely, given that the other three riders bring death and destruction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some have also suggested that this is the false Messiah on a white horse with a crown (we will see the REAL Messiah on a white horse in Chapter 19).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, this rider doesn&amp;rsquo;t conquer by war because he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He deceives the people by pretending to come in peace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This crown is the &lt;em&gt;stephanos&lt;/em&gt;, the victor&amp;rsquo;s wreath, not the &lt;em&gt;diadem&lt;/em&gt; that Jesus will wear, indicating he&amp;rsquo;s the sovereign, reigning king.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He carries a bow just like Nimrod the hunter did; Nimrod was the first global deceiver (the first human one anyway). Genesis 10.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, this view is also potentially troublesome when we consider that Jesus is the one ostensibly sending the antichrist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is best to consider the riders as similar to the &amp;ldquo;destroyer/death angel&amp;rdquo; of Exodus 12:23 – it is an otherwise unidentified supernatural (angelic) being sent to carry out God&amp;rsquo;s judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;other-notes&#34;&gt;Other notes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hebrew word (קֶשֶׁת) is used either for the bow as a weapon or the bow as the sign of the covenant with Noah (Gen 9:13).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The conquest may be a seemingly peaceful treaty, or it could be a weapon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In any case, the ancient readers would have understood that this horseman represented conquest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While &amp;ldquo;Sword, feminine, and pestilence&amp;rdquo; are frequent idioms throughout the Bible, the prophets did not apparently see the false white horse.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jer 14:12; Jer 24:10; Jer 27:8; Eze 6:11; Eze 7:15; Eze 12:16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose sword, feminine, and pestilence are external threats. In that case, the false white horse possibly represents the enemy within – the enemy we welcome into our ecclesia with open arms but who is only there to conquer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster: this is the spirit of conquest that has always existed throughout humanity,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; perhaps taking a specific form in the final days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-63-4-red&#34;&gt;Rev 6:3-4 Red&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;When he broke the second seal, I heard the second living being say, &amp;ldquo;Go!&amp;rdquo; Another horse went out, a red one; and its rider was given the power to take peace away from the earth and make people slaughter each other. He was given a great sword&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mat 24:10  And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note &amp;ldquo;given the power&amp;rdquo; – all horsemen have to have God&amp;rsquo;s permission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red has long been associated with war – Mars was the Roman god of war. Hence Mars is the &amp;ldquo;red planet.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later in Revelation, we see the red dragon (Rev 12:3) and the red beast (Rev 17:3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster: this is the spirit of war, including civil war-brother against brother. It unleashes the worst in man, as we saw during the 20th century.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stern sees the 1st and 2nd seals as both representing war, but in two different aspects.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st seal – subjecting peoples one to another&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2nd seal – hate between nations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-65-6-famine&#34;&gt;Rev 6:5-6 Famine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When he broke the third seal, I heard the third living being say, &amp;ldquo;Go!&amp;rdquo; I looked, and there in front of me was a black horse, and its rider held in his hand a pair of scales.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Then I heard what sounded like a voice from among the four living beings say, &amp;ldquo;Two pounds of wheat for a day&amp;rsquo;s wages! Six pounds of barley for the same price! But don&amp;rsquo;t damage the oil or the wine!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The scales suggest rationing – every ounce of product sold was to be carefully measured.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keener suggests the price of the wheat is 10x what it should be, so a family would be forced to buy the cheaper and less nourishing barley.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we hear &amp;ldquo;pounds,&amp;rdquo; in our minds, we think of weight, not volume.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wheat is usually sold by volume: such as one quart of wheat and three quarts of barley.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During times of famine, selling bread by weight is attested to in the Scripture.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lev 26:26 When I break your supply of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in a single oven and shall dole out your bread again by weight, and you shall eat and not be satisfied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eze 4:10 And your food that you eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day; from day to day you shall eat it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day&amp;rsquo;s wage – literally a denarius. We see this unit of measure frequently in the Gospels.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barley and wheat were basic necessities; oil and wine were luxuries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Messianic Era, there will be an abundance of Wine and Oil
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To Lancaster, the fact that the oil and wine are not touched suggests a short duration of the famine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These crops would take many years to replace, likely jeopardizing availability in the messianic kingdom if they were touched.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josephus records that famine killed more Jews during the First Jewish War than the Romans. At one point, when the Romans burst into the homes in Jerusalem, they were surprised to find most were already dead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was around 20-25 years before Revelation was written, so it would have still been on the minds of many of the recipients (like the mention of a &amp;ldquo;plane crashing into a building&amp;rdquo; would still be a fresh memory for many of us).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-67-8-pale&#34;&gt;Rev 6:7-8 Pale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;When he broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living being say, &amp;ldquo;Go!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I looked, and there in front of me was a pallid, sickly-looking horse. Its rider&amp;rsquo;s name was Death, and Sh&amp;rsquo;ol followed behind him. They were given authority to kill one-quarter of the world by war, by famine, by plagues and with the wild animals of the earth.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Revelation 1, Messiah holds the keys to Death and Hades. He has full authority over them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The translators have a tough time describing this color
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here the Greek word is &lt;em&gt;chloros&lt;/em&gt; (chlorine, chlorophyll) – like a pale green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/7a75ef15bb6ad82e80e912ced778c044.png&#34; width=&#34;20%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Zech 1, it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;sorrell&amp;rdquo; (pale brown); Zech 6: &amp;ldquo;dappled&amp;rdquo; (patchy, spotty), in CJB/ESV it&amp;rsquo;s pallid/pale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In any case, &amp;ldquo;sickly&amp;rdquo; is the thought (like the nauseated emoji).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Eze 14:21 “For thus says the Lord GOD: How much more when I send upon Jerusalem my four disastrous acts of judgment, sword, famine, wild beasts, and pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast! &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Eze 5:15-17 You shall be a reproach and a taunt, a warning and a horror, to the nations all around you, when I execute judgments on you in anger and fury, and with furious rebukes—I am the LORD; I have spoken— when I send against you the deadly arrows of famine, arrows for destruction, which I will send to destroy you, and when I bring more and more famine upon you and break your supply of bread. I will send famine and wild beasts against you, and they will rob you of your children. Pestilence and blood shall pass through you, and I will bring the sword upon you. I am the LORD; I have spoken.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Death claims the body, and Sheol/Hades claims the soul. Potentially this is the death and destruction that result from the first three seals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missler says don&amp;rsquo;t discount microscopic &amp;ldquo;wild animals.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And he passed away before COVID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-5th-seal-martyrs&#34;&gt;The 5th Seal: Martyrs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-69&#34;&gt;Rev 6:9&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;When the Lamb broke the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been put to death for proclaiming the Word of God, that is, for bearing witness.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Lev 17:11  For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it for you on the altar to make atonement for your souls, for it is the blood that makes atonement by the life.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messianic Rabbi Lichtenstein explains: &amp;ldquo;This is in accordance with the Jewish faith that says the souls of the righteous who were killed are like offerings upon the heavenly altar in the heavenly temple.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just as Messiah did&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Hebrews 9:23-24: Thus, it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God has not forgotten about those in Asia martyred for His name; they will be vindicated (those who perished under persecutions of Nero, Jewish War, Domitian, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here, the martyrs are viewed as sacrifices just like the Passover Lamb of Revelation 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Lev 5:9 and he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, while the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John apparently can &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; souls in his visionary state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the first four seals parallel Matthew 24:5-8, note Matthew 24:9: Mat 24:9 “Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name&amp;rsquo;s sake.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-610&#34;&gt;Rev 6:10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;They cried out in a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;Sovereign Ruler, HaKadosh, the True One, how long will it be before you judge the people living on earth and avenge our blood?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Bible, blood guilt is a much larger issue than many realize.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It stains the entire community, and God will avenge it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a sense, their shed blood is crying out just like Able&amp;rsquo;s in &lt;small&gt; Gen 4:10 And the LORD said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother&amp;rsquo;s blood is crying to me from the ground. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Mat 23:35 so that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the arrangement of the Hebrew Bible, Zechariah is the last recorded martyr in 2 Chronicles 24.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Deu 32:43 “Rejoice with him, O heavens; bow down to him, all gods, for he avenges the blood of his children and takes vengeance on his adversaries. He repays those who hate him and cleanses his people&amp;rsquo;s land.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Psa 79:10 Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” Let the avenging of the outpoured blood of your servants be known among the nations before our eyes! &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;How long?&amp;rdquo; (in the sense of &amp;ldquo;when will You make things right?&amp;quot;) is a common refrain, particularly in the Psalms.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Psa 13:1-2 To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. How long, O LORD? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me? (2) How long must I take counsel in my soul and have sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me? &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Zec 1:12 Then the angel of the LORD said, ‘O LORD of hosts, how long will you have no mercy on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, against which you have been angry these seventy years?’ &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;How long?&amp;rdquo; could also mean duration.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Isa 6:11-13 Then I said, “How long, O Lord?” And he said: “Until cities lie waste without inhabitant, and houses without people, and the land is a desolate waste, (12) and the LORD removes people far away, and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land. (13) And though a tenth remain in it, it will be burned again, like a terebinth or an oak, whose stump remains when it is felled.” The holy seed is its stump. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good general reminder is that vengeance is God&amp;rsquo;s option, not ours.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Rom 12:19 Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Mat 5:44-45 But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-611&#34;&gt;Rev 6:11&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Each of them was given a white robe; and they were told to wait a little longer, until the full number of their fellow servants should be reached, of their brothers who would be killed, just as they had been.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This verse reminds us that we need to have the Heavenly perspective, not an earthly one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It may appear that the enemy is winning, but that&amp;rsquo;s a façade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The martyrs receive white robes; in other words, they are pure and ceremonially clean in God&amp;rsquo;s eyes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Rev 17:6 And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints, the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I marveled greatly. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Rev 18:24 And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all who have been slain on earth.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ultimately, unlike the immediate unleashing of the judgment of the first four seals, the 5th seal promises judgment, but judgment is deferred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reminiscent of Genesis 15:14-16: &lt;small&gt;But I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward they shall come out with great possessions. As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age. And they shall come back here in the fourth generation, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Son of David will not come until the blood of the last martyr has been shed.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White robe is possibly a temporary covering until the martyrs receive their outer bodies to be restored in the resurrection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;timing-questions&#34;&gt;Timing questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some scholars see the seals, trumpets, and bowls as sequential, one happening after the other in chronological order, other scholars see amplification or parallelism. In other words, the seven trumpets describe the tribulation, then the trumpets and then the bowels/vials go back and pick out different aspects of the tribulation. Scholars in this camp note that the 6th and 7th seals, the 6th and 7th trumpets, and the 6th and 7th bowls all seem to be referencing the end of this age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, as opposed to all seals being yet future, some scholars (e.g., Lancaster citing Lichtenstein) see the first five seals as already opened, while the 6th and 7th are yet future. This is based on a reading of the order given in Matthew 24 and Luke 21, as well as by simple observation of the world around us throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24:6 talks about wars and rumors of wars but says the &amp;ldquo;end is not yet.&amp;rdquo; As we looked at before, in the Luke account, Jesus says to &amp;ldquo;look up, for your redemption draws near.&amp;rdquo; Remember, he was telling that to His 1st-century disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have the Gospel going to the ends of the earth, which presumably would need to happen before the &amp;ldquo;restrainer&amp;rdquo; is removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 24:9 talks about martyrs, which is the 5th seal. We can see that most of the calamities described thus far in Matthew 24 have been happening. Then we have a passage on the Abomination of Desolation (24:15-28), which has NOT happened yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in Matthew 24:29, we see what appears to be the 6th seal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mat 24:29 “Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, right now we are in between the opening of the 5th and 6th seals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-sixth-seal&#34;&gt;The Sixth seal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-612-14&#34;&gt;Rev 6:12-14&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Then I watched as he broke the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake, the sun turned black as sackcloth worn in mourning, and the full moon became blood-red.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;The stars fell from heaven to earth just as a fig tree drops its figs when shaken by a strong wind.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The sky receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we talked about in chapters 2-3, earthquakes were prevalent, and often quite destructive in Asia Minor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st of three earthquakes in Revelation: Rev 6:12; Rev 11:13;Rev 16:18-19.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Darkness recalls the ten plagues.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Exo 10:21 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, a darkness to be felt.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &amp;ldquo;darkness to be felt&amp;rdquo; is not natural darkness. There is much more going on here than merely the absence of light.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similar descriptions appear in Isaiah, Ezekiel, Amos, and Daniel
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Isa 13:9-10 Behold, the day of the LORD comes, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger, to make the land a desolation and to destroy its sinners from it. (10) For the stars of the heavens and their constellations will not give their light; the sun will be dark at its rising, and the moon will not shed its light. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Eze 32:7-8 When I blot you (speaking of Egypt) out, I will cover the heavens and make their stars dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give its light. (8) All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over you, and put darkness on your land, declares the Lord GOD. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Amo 8:9 “And on that day,” declares the Lord GOD, “I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Dan 8:10 It grew great, even to the host of heaven. And some of the host and some of the stars it threw down to the ground and trampled on them. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As this is apocalyptic literature, we can&amp;rsquo;t necessarily assume literal astronomical events. These could simply be hyperbolic descriptions of a general cosmic judgment or allegories, such as the stars cast down representing fallen angels. In any case, whatever it is, believers will recognize it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What a &amp;ldquo;coincidence.&amp;rdquo; Matthew 24 also mentions a fig tree.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mat 24:32-35 “From the fig tree, learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near. (33) So also, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, at the very gates. (34) Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. (35) Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Isaiah also references a fig tree, and the sky rolled up like a scroll: Isa 34:4 All the host of heaven shall rot away, and the skies roll up like a scroll. All their host shall fall, as leaves fall from the vine, like leaves falling from the fig tree. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possibly, Isaiah 40:22 and Psalm 104:2 are in view. These verses describe the skies as being like a tent or canopy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mountains and Islands are likely the gentile kingdoms/nations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many ancient cultures had sky deities, so rolling up the sky could be an act of judgment against these pagan gods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-615-17&#34;&gt;Rev 6:15-17&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Then the earth&amp;rsquo;s kings, the rulers, the generals, the rich and the mighty—indeed, everyone, slave and free—hid himself in caves and among the rocks in the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks, &amp;ldquo;Fall on us, and hide us from the face of the One sitting on the throne and from the fury of the Lamb!&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;For the Great Day of their fury has come, and who can stand?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judgment is not only for the elite. All enemies of God will be punished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The enemies of God hiding in caves to escape His wrath recurs throughout the Scriptures.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Jos 10:16-19 These five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah. (17) And it was told to Joshua, “The five kings have been found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.” (18) And Joshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave and set men by it to guard them, (19) but do not stay there yourselves. Pursue your enemies; attack their rear guard. Do not let them enter their cities, for the LORD your God has given them into your hand.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Isa 2:19 And people shall enter the caves of the rocks and the holes of the ground, from before the terror of the LORD, and from the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Hos 10:8 The high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed. Thorn and thistle shall grow up on their altars, and they shall say to the mountains, “Cover us,” and to the hills, “Fall on us.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who can stand?&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Joe 2:11 The LORD utters his voice before his army, for his camp is exceedingly great; he who executes his word is powerful. For the day of the LORD is great and very awesome; who can endure it? &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mal 3:2 But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner&amp;rsquo;s fire and like fullers&#39; soap. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;fury of the Lamb&amp;rdquo; is a contradiction in the natural world, but our Lamb is also a Lion in the heavenly realm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Great Day&amp;rdquo; = Day of the Lord, mentioned frequently in the Bible.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selected Old Testament: Isa 2:12; Jer 46:10; Zep_1:18; Zep 2:2-3; Lam 2:22&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selected New Testament: Rom 2:5,; 2 Th 2:2; 2 Pe 3:10; 1 Co 1:8; 2 Co 1:14; Php 1:10; Rev 16:14; Mat 10:15; 2 Pe 2:9; 1 Jn 4:17&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;closing-thoughts&#34;&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These next sections are given so that we may recognize what is called the &amp;ldquo;principal of expositional constancy.&amp;rdquo;  The Bible is entirely consistent.  Despite being written by over 40 human authors over thousands of years, it is one skillfully designed message from our creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;six-followed-by-a-rest&#34;&gt;Six followed by a rest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In chapter 6, we have six of the seven scrolls broken&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seventh will not be broken until chapter 8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The theme of &amp;ldquo;six of something followed by a rest&amp;rdquo; frequently occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Six days of creation, followed by the seventh day, which never technically was completed (there was no &amp;ldquo;and there was evening and morning, seventh-day&amp;rdquo; verse).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Six days shall you work followed by the seventh day of rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In chapter 7, we will have that rest before the seventh scroll is broken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will be a similar break between the 6th and 7th trumpets.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sixth trumpet is in 9:14&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seventh trumpet is in 11:15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Luke 21:12 begins with &amp;ldquo;Before these things…&amp;rdquo;. Luke 21:12-24 appears to be describing the first Jewish war (66-72) and, specifically, the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE. In other words, the events in 12-24 happen first, followed by the events in verses 21:8-11 and 25-33.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;similarity-to-the-plagues-of-egypt&#34;&gt;Similarity to the Plagues of Egypt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final redemption will be prefaced by the same types of calamities that God brought upon Egypt, except this time, the plagues will be poured out upon the entire earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a moment in a Jewish Passover Seder where they recite the ten plagues, they spill ten drops of wine from the 3rd cup. This reminds them that, although the Passover is overall a joyous occasion and reason to celebrate, it comes at the expense of others. Proverbs 24:17 says, &amp;ldquo;when your enemy falls, do not rejoice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Messianic Jews and gentile believers who participate in a Passover Seder, the drops of blood have added significance as they directly relate to Yeshua, who shed His blood for us. Mat 26:27-29 And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, “Drink of it, all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father&amp;rsquo;s kingdom.” He said this over the 3rd cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often think of prophecy as prediction followed by fulfillment. There is also a very real sense where prophecy is pattern. Abraham acted out a prophecy when he started to sacrifice Isaac. On that very same hill in Jerusalem, another Father WOULD sacrifice His Son. It has been suggested that Abraham KNEW he was acting out prophecy. Gen 22:14 So Abraham called the name of that place, “The LORD will provide”; as it is said to this day, “On the mount of the LORD &lt;strong&gt;it shall be provided&lt;/strong&gt;.” Note the &amp;ldquo;future&amp;rdquo; tense.&lt;/p&gt;
