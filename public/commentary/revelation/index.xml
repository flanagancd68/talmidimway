&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;This is the revelation which God gave to Yeshua the Messiah, so that he could show his servants what must happen very soon. He communicated it by sending his angel to his servant Yochanan,  2.  who bore witness to the Word of God and to the testimony of Yeshua the Messiah, as much as he saw.  3.  Blessed are the reader and hearers of the words of this prophecy, provided they obey the things written in it! For the time is near!  4.  From: Yochanan To: The seven Messianic communities in the province of Asia: Grace and shalom to you from the One who is, who was and who is coming; from the sevenfold Spirit before his throne;  5.  and from Yeshua the Messiah, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead and the ruler of the earth&amp;rsquo;s kings. To him, the one who loves us, who has freed us from our sins at the cost of his blood,  6.  who has caused us to be a kingdom, that is, cohanim for God, his Father—to him be the glory and the rulership forever and ever. Amen.  7.  Look! He is coming with the clouds! Every eye will see him, including those who pierced him; and all the tribes of the Land will mourn him. Yes! Amen!  8.  &amp;ldquo;I am the &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;Z,&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; says Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, the One who is, who was and who is coming.  9.  I, Yochanan, am a brother of yours and a fellow-sharer in the suffering, kingship and perseverance that come from being united with Yeshua. I had been exiled to the island called Patmos for having proclaimed the message of God and borne witness to Yeshua.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to our series on the book of Revelation we call &amp;ldquo;Revelation Backgrounds.&amp;rdquo;  In this introductory episode, we will provide an introduction to the book, some background into Jewish Apocalyptic literature, and we&amp;rsquo;ll provide what we see are Seven Keys to Interpretation.  Revelation can be a complex book, but these keys will help assure we get started on the right path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SfuWhCybaYU&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;revelation-not-revelations&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Revelation&amp;rdquo; (not &amp;ldquo;Revelations&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In his course on Jerusalem, Dr. Cargill said, &amp;ldquo;the name of the book is &amp;lsquo;RevelationnnnnnNUH,&#39;&amp;rdquo; he said to emphasize the singular&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He continued, &amp;ldquo;This is a pet peeve of mine. If you call it &amp;lsquo;RevelationS,&amp;rsquo; it means you have never read the 1st verse, and I will flunk you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, we won&amp;rsquo;t flunk anybody, but this is a good reminder that the correct name of the book is not &amp;ldquo;Revelation&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;rdquo; but &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Revelation.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-apocalyptic-literature&#34;&gt;What is &amp;ldquo;Apocalyptic Literature&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We often think of an apocalypse as some cataclysmic event involving worldwide destruction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the Greek word &lt;em&gt;apokalupsis&lt;/em&gt;, apocalypse means &amp;ldquo;revealing&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;unveiling.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specifically, we would say an unveiling of something not previously known, which wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be known were it not for divine intervention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the days of John, there was a significant body of Jewish apocalyptic literature that he and much of his audience would have known&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The general flow of apocalyptic literature:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A person in a &amp;ldquo;spiritual state,&amp;rdquo; such as fasting and praying, is caught up to a realm usually unseen by mortals (possibly physically or possibly by way of a vision).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is given a tour, usually guided by an angel, where he sees heavenly worship services, God&amp;rsquo;s throne, and various hallowed chambers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He also sometimes sees &amp;ldquo;the war behind the war.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, when there is a physical war on earth, the person gets to witness a corresponding unseen spiritual warfare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then he gets to witness a final climactic battle between the forces of good and evil and resulting judgments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often, the things the person with the vision sees are nearly impossible to put into words
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best he can do is use the best words he can,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because the human is trying to explain the inexplicable, we end up with the extreme symbolism, such as beasts doing strange things (Daniel 7:5-6) and objects that seem to defy the laws of physics (Ezekiel 1:16-20)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The general purpose of an Apocalypse is for God to reassure His people to remain faithful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster summarizes a biblical apocalypse like this:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Although things on earth seem terribly unjust, with the righteous suffering and the wicked prospering, a day is coming where God will pour out his wrath upon the wicked and reward the righteous.&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, &amp;ldquo;your faith and suffering are not in vain.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;The Apocalypse of Paul?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know Paul (or a man he knew) had an Apocalypse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Corinthians 12:2-4: &amp;ldquo;I know a man in Messiah (whether in the body I don&amp;rsquo;t know, or whether out of the body I don&amp;rsquo;t know—God knows)—fourteen years ago, he was caught up to the third heaven. I know such a man (whether in the body or outside of the body I don&amp;rsquo;t know—God knows)— he was caught up into Paradise and heard words too sacred to tell, which a human is not permitted to utter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a classic apocalyptic vision. Were it not for the &amp;ldquo;gag order,&amp;rdquo; we might have had not one but two Books titled &amp;ldquo;Revelation&amp;rdquo;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;seven-keys-to-interpretation&#34;&gt;Seven Keys to Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Revelation is perhaps the most studied but least understood book in the New Testament.&amp;rdquo; – Daniel Lancaster&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our primary challenge with understanding Revelation, or just about any other book of the Bible, is that we are separated from the original intended audience in three critical areas: time, distance, and most importantly, culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/49f033022fe7e954bd6946926032fbc0.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time – John recorded these events nearly 2000 years ago, and he often references writings written hundreds of years before that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distance – Turkey, the geographic setting for Revelation 2-3, is over 6000 nautical miles away from the central United States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Culture
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setting is a Jewish author writing to Jews and gentile God-fearers in the diaspora (Jews living outside the Land of Israel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These early believers knew their Scriptures, what we would call the &amp;ldquo;Old Testament,&amp;rdquo; much better than we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These believers brought a very different set of experiences, assumptions, and expectations than we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These areas may be less familiar to us if our context is western Protestant Christianity and we have never traveled to these lands. To bridge these gaps, our study in Revelation Backgrounds synthesizes several published commentaries that focus on the historical, geographic, and cultural (specifically Jewish) aspects of the Bible. We also consult Bible atlases, travel videos, and occasionally extra-biblical documents and pertinent archeologic findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In keeping with the pattern of &amp;ldquo;sevens&amp;rdquo; in Revelation, we have seven &amp;ldquo;Keys to Interpretation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-follow-the-talmidim-way&#34;&gt;#1 Follow the &amp;ldquo;Talmidim Way&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Talmidim&lt;/em&gt; is the Hebrew word for &amp;ldquo;disciples.&amp;rdquo; I am a &lt;em&gt;talmid&lt;/em&gt;. You are a &lt;em&gt;talmid&lt;/em&gt;. We are all &lt;em&gt;Talmidim&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talmidim was one of the first Hebrew words I ever learned, so it has a special place in my heart. The word is symbolic of a journey I&amp;rsquo;ve been on for over ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an expression that ancient Jewish disciples would follow their rabbi so closely that they would be &amp;ldquo;covered in his dust.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/547b202d55681e683cc9dab7b8528db4.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;33%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, I call the ministry the &lt;em&gt;Talmidim Way&lt;/em&gt;. Our logo contains a drawing of an ancient stone footpath to remind us that our faith is founded on old ways, and we should walk in the dust of our Rabbi Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Keener is one of my go-to commentators for historical context. He says much more eloquently, &amp;ldquo;Shedding light on the original provides modern readers better access to the message of the book when they seek to apply it today.&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-be-open-to-the-spirits-leading&#34;&gt;#2 Be open to the Spirit&amp;rsquo;s leading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us not cling too tightly to any presupposed interpretation or application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My positions on Revelation have changed over the years (see &amp;ldquo;we reserve the right to get smarter&amp;rdquo; callout)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to dive into the text, leverage the wisdom of trustworthy commentators who have gone before us, check everything out against Scripture&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and let the Spirit pour into us.
&lt;img src=&#34;images/dove.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may mean we need to leave behind a previously held position&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider yourself lucky if you do not already have a firm position on &amp;ldquo;pretribulation,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;preterist,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;postmillennial.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More division than edification occurs over these subjects, in my opinion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s ok to hold firm views, but remember we are all brothers and sisters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can and should debate and challenge; Proverbs 27:17 says, &amp;ldquo;As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let us never divide over these types of matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;We reserve the right to get smarter.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I admittedly am looking at myself when I say not to cling too tightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other times I&amp;rsquo;ve studied Revelation from end to end, I&amp;rsquo;ve been rather staunchly in the &amp;ldquo;futurist, pre-tribulation&amp;rdquo; camp. That means that my view of Revelation tended to be that after chapter 4, everything that happened was yet future (futurist). Before this happened, all the faithful believers would be raptured before the tribulation (pretribulation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, particularly after digging into the Gospels context and other things, I&amp;rsquo;m no longer 100% sold on that approach. Also, if we look at Jesus&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;one will be taken and the other left&amp;rdquo; statements and in the parables where all the fish are hauled in, but then some are removed, it&amp;rsquo;s not the good who are removed. It&amp;rsquo;s the wicked who are removed. It&amp;rsquo;s the rotten fish that are thrown back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not saying definitively that the pretribulation view is wrong. Only that now, my opinions are more flexible after further review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to have a colleague who liked to say, &amp;ldquo;we always reserve the right to get smarter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-be-a-berean-acts-1711&#34;&gt;#3 be a Berean (Acts 17:11)!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will begin every study with Acts 17:11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These (Bereans) were more noble than those in Thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so. (Acts 17:11 KJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 17:11 is paramount for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every other commentator and I are human. I will, of course, make every attempt to be faithful and reliable. Still, we all have our biases, blind spots, and mistaken conclusions.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I assert a fact, I will try to back it up with a citation. When I offer an opinion or speculation, I will try to disclose that also. After each lesson, I will include a list of works cited. I encourage everyone to never take my word for it but validate what I say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acts 17:11 tells us the Biblical model is to &amp;ldquo;trust but verify.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is up to the reader to do your research and verify that any facts and conclusions are scriptural.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all called to &amp;ldquo;be Bereans.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-understand-the-intended-audience&#34;&gt;#4 Understand the intended audience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bible, including the Book of Revelation, was written FOR us but not TO us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are operating under the assumption that the Apostle John wrote Revelation, likely between 90-95 CE&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He was instructed to share it with seven specific Messianic communities/congregations.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note we should not say &amp;ldquo;seven churches&amp;rdquo; because no such thing as a &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; existed in 95.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reason for the apocalypse was to provide hope for the faithful during the intense persecution of the Roman Emperor Domitian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Bible is written &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; us in the sense of 2 Timothy 3:16-17. All Scripture is inspired by God and useful &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; teaching, &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; reproof, &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; restoration, and &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; training in righteousness, 17. so that the person belonging to God may be capable, fully equipped &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; every good deed.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teaching/doctrine = what &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reproof = what is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restoration/correction = how to &lt;strong&gt;get&lt;/strong&gt; right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Training in righteousness/instruction = how to &lt;strong&gt;stay&lt;/strong&gt; right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-understand-revelation-is-a-jewish-book&#34;&gt;#5 Understand Revelation is a Jewish book&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revelation is a Jewish book. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s really Jewish. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s the most Jewish book in our New Testament&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This fact is why we as Gentiles often have trouble understanding Revelation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The symbolism can be baffling since we likely won&amp;rsquo;t have the background in the Hebrew Scriptures that John&amp;rsquo;s original audience had.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are 404 verses in Revelation, but there are allusions to over 800 Old Testament verses. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, John never directly quotes any other verse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Psalms, and Deuteronomy are frequently alluded to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation 1:3 promises a blessing for those who hear and obey what has been written.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the exact nature of the blessing is not stated, a thorough study of Revelation will take us into nearly every other book of the Bible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a blessing when we study God&amp;rsquo;s word. The Jewish sages see Bible study as worship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proverbs 3:13-14: Happy (blessed) is the man who finds wisdom and the man who gains understanding. For her trade-value is better than silver, and her yield better than fine gold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will call attention to many of these references as we go verse-by-verse through Revelation Backgrounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewish imagery is everywhere: Jewish prophecy, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Sukkot, Palm Branches, Shofars, Menorahs, books of judgment, the Book of Life, liturgical functions and ceremonies about the Temple in Jerusalem, etc.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We assume that John wrote this between 90-95 CE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is significant as it would have been &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the Roman destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John drew from a time in Israel&amp;rsquo;s history where a nearly identical event happened: the destruction of the First Temple in 586 BCE by the Babylonians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing this allows us to frame John&amp;rsquo;s references to Babylon in their proper context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we approach Revelation and ignore its Jewishness, we will find it difficult, if not impossible, to understand.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But if we are Bereans and search the Scriptures, we will discover Revelation significantly demystified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For this reason, we will be presenting verses from Revelation and other books from the &amp;ldquo;Complete Jewish Bible&amp;rdquo; (CJB).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CJB is a translation by Dr. David H. Stern that seeks to &amp;ldquo;present the Bible (Old and New Testaments) as a complete Jewish book and connect readers with the Jewishness of the Messiah.&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It also seeks to correct anachronisms, such as the label &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; in the New Testament before such an entity ever existed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-be-suspicious-if-an-interpretation-could-not-have-occurred-to-the-original-audience&#34;&gt;#6 Be suspicious if an interpretation could not have occurred to the original audience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If an interpretation would not or could not have occurred to John or his audience, we will treat it with a degree of healthy suspicion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The historical aspect tends to get the least attention from other Protestant-based commentators.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, how the events described in Revelation relate to what was happening in John&amp;rsquo;s Day will be our primary focus with Revelation Backgrounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many interpretations may appear to &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo;; they just may not fit within our scope. We want to stay focused on the 1st-century context as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Healthy suspicion doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we reject it outright just because it was beyond the scope of the original audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is perfectly capable of delivering a message that is just as relevant for us as it was to the original audience.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, the &amp;ldquo;seven letters&amp;rdquo; have many layers of understanding and application (admittedly, some are concrete while others are speculative).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no reason why multiple layers of interpretation can&amp;rsquo;t be correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;7-acknowledge-that-fear-is-not-from-god&#34;&gt;#7 Acknowledge that fear is not from God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear is not from God&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fear not,&amp;rdquo; or an equivalent, is one of the most frequently repeated commands in the Bible.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Mathew 10:28, Jesus said the only fear we should have is the fear of God, a healthy fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Far too many approach Revelation with a spirit of fear; may it not be so with us!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We must always apply &amp;ldquo;Acts 17:11 logic&amp;rdquo; to any potential interpretation.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the given interpretation consistent with the rest of the Scriptures?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does it magnify Yeshua (Jesus) the Messiah?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does it give us a spirit of peace?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we are left fearful of anyone or anything besides God, then the interpretation/application is not from God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;no-fear-means-avoiding-frontpage-exegesis&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;No Fear&amp;rdquo; means avoiding &amp;ldquo;Frontpage Exegesis&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media loves fear. Fear sells. If it bleeds, it leads. Yet we just said that fear is not from God. Fear should not be a factor in our attempts to understand Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Exegesis&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracting concepts from the biblical text while applying reasonable academic inquiry techniques&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&amp;ldquo;Frontpage&amp;rdquo; Exegesis&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing every sensational headline or significant current as a fulfillment of biblical prophecy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation is NOT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A crystal ball to predict the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A description of current events in the 21st century&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A chronological, linear sequence of end-time events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A literal narrative, but neither is it an allegory
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember this: &lt;strong&gt;Revelation is not an allegory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frontpage exegesis intentionally or unintentionally allegorizes Scripture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem with an allegory is that we can twist it to mean anything we want it to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For context, if we were to study Christian writings during WWI, a large segment of Christians believed they were living in the days of Revelation. Some even quit their jobs, stopped having children, and even committed suicide.
&lt;img src=&#34;images/frontpage_exegesis.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;20%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During WWII, many thought Hitler was the Antichrist (not entirely without reason).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1988, one person was &lt;em&gt;so sure&lt;/em&gt; the rapture was going to occur that year, he published a book, &amp;ldquo;88 Reasons Why the Rapture will be in 1988,&amp;rdquo; and then had the audacity to say &amp;ldquo;if I&amp;rsquo;m wrong, the Bible is wrong.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over the last decade, the Beast was &amp;ldquo;obviously&amp;rdquo; Donald Trump or Barack Obama, depending on your political viewpoint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone throughout history who has claimed that he or she was living out the events prophesied by Revelation has been wrong. That&amp;rsquo;s the problem with Frontpage Exegesis. It&amp;rsquo;s always been wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; fair to say, &amp;ldquo;Revelation describes literal events using signs/symbolic language.&amp;rdquo; We&amp;rsquo;ll talk more about some of these signs below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;revelation-metadata&#34;&gt;Revelation &amp;ldquo;metadata&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s look at the &amp;ldquo;who, what, when, where&amp;rdquo; of Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;who-wrote-revelation&#34;&gt;Who wrote Revelation?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 1:1-2 This is the Revelation which God gave to Yeshua the Messiah so that he could show his servants what must happen very soon. He communicated it by sending his angel to his servant &lt;mark&gt;Yochanan (John)&lt;/mark&gt;, 2. who bore witness to the Word of God and to the testimony of Yeshua the Messiah, as much as he saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note the progression of transmission: God → Jesus → His angel/messenger → John → Jesus&amp;rsquo; servants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ultimate Author is God
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation is not just &amp;ldquo;divinely inspired&amp;rdquo; but is &amp;ldquo;divinely given.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divinely inspired – the Holy Spirit guided the words, but the structure, choice of words, what aspects to include, what to omit, and other stylistic details were at the discretion of the human author&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divinely given – the words, what to include/omit, and so forth came directly from God. The human author was primarily a transcriber and copy editor
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation is the only New Testament book that is divinely given; all others are divinely-inspired&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the Torah, the first five books of Moses, are divinely given (The phrase, &amp;ldquo;The LORD spoke to Moses and said, &amp;lsquo;Thus shall you say to the Children of Israel…&#39;&amp;rdquo; appears frequently.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John wrote down the words of the angel/messenger unless he was told not to (Revelation 10:4)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While we can&amp;rsquo;t prove it beyond all doubt, the evidence is convincing that Revelation&amp;rsquo;s (human) author is John the Apostle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, the author is John, the &lt;em&gt;talmid&lt;/em&gt; (disciple) of Yeshua, the author of the Gospel of John, and the three epistles that bear his name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One additional piece of evidence is the phrase &amp;ldquo;bore witness.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This type of legal/courtroom terminology is all over the Gospel of John.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John presents evidence that Yeshua/Jesus is the rightful authority for Israel and the good shepherd. In addition, John also bears witness that the Jerusalem religious establishment is unauthorized and its leaders are the &amp;ldquo;bad shepherds&amp;rdquo; over Israel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;when-and-where-was-revelation-written&#34;&gt;When and where was Revelation written?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 1:9 I, John, your brother and fellow partaker with you in the tribulation and kingdom and patient endurance that are in Yeshua, was on &lt;mark&gt;the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Yeshua&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/e45914e26cc0be101f69fd4d54a746be.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iraneus, the earliest source who cited the Apostle John as the author, also stated that he wrote during the worldwide persecution of Jews and Christians of Emperor Domitian. Domitian was also responsible for exiling John to Patmos.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The small island of Patmos is about 7.5 miles (12 km) long from north to south and at its widest is 6 miles (10 km) from east to west.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian was the Roman Emperor from 81-96.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most conservative scholars believe Revelation was written between 90-95.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    For information on exactly how John ended up in Patmos &amp;ldquo;because of the Word of God and Testimony of Yeshua,&amp;rdquo; see our Revelation Backgrounds Supplement &amp;ldquo;Historical Background of John&amp;rsquo;s Exile.&amp;rdquo;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-was-revelation-written&#34;&gt;How was Revelation written?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 1:1b: He &lt;mark&gt;communicated it&lt;/mark&gt; by sending His angel to His servant Yochanan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Greek word for &amp;ldquo;communicated it&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;made it known&amp;rdquo; is &lt;em&gt;σημαίνω&lt;/em&gt; to signify, literally &amp;ldquo;render into signs.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We might say &amp;ldquo;encoded.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missler writes, &amp;ldquo;Revelation is in code, but every code is explained elsewhere in Scripture!&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every sign in the Bible points to something – in the case of Revelation, the signs point to the climax of God&amp;rsquo;s plan for Man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Readers familiar with the Old Testament would have understood what these signs represented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will get more comfortable with John&amp;rsquo;s communication as we dig into the Hebrew Scriptures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sevens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another way Revelation is &amp;ldquo;signified&amp;rdquo; is through repetitive patterns, specifically the number seven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sevens are conspicuous in Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In biblical thought, seven is the number that denotes &amp;quot; completion,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;finality,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;perfection.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Shabbat (7th day) is a day of peace, joy, and rest; the Messianic Kingdom is often described as entering into the (Sabbath) peace/joy/rest of God&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This comes from Genesis 2:1-3
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So the heavens and the earth were completed along with their entire array. 2. God completed—on the seventh day—His work that He made, and He ceased—on the seventh day—from all His work that He made. 3. Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, for on it He ceased from all His work that God created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of the seven patterns are obvious (congregations, seals, trumpets, bowls), while others are less noticeable.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The depiction of Messiah in chapter 1 has seven features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each letter to a congregation in chapters 2-3 contains seven components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are seven &amp;ldquo;blessings&amp;rdquo; (or beatitudes) scattered throughout the book, beginning with the blessing to the one who reads and obeys the words at Revelation 1:3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;to-whom-was-revelation-written&#34;&gt;To whom was Revelation written?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 1:4: From: Yochanan To: The seven Messianic communities in the province of Asia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John, at the time, was over the congregation in Ephesus and had responsibility for the other six nearby assemblies: Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are circled on the map, along with John&amp;rsquo;s location on Patmos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John was tasked with shepherding his flocks through this tumultuous time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    The term &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; is an anachronism
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;images/seven_congregations.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At this point, you may be asking, &amp;ldquo;why aren&amp;rsquo;t you using the word &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo;? I thought they were the &amp;ldquo;seven churches of Revelation?&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can say with reasonable certainty that the name of the building where 1st-century believers in Asia met was called a synagogue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These communities or congregations were predominately Jewish but had their share of gentile believers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t recommend calling them &amp;ldquo;churches&amp;rdquo; because the &amp;ldquo;church,&amp;rdquo; either a building or an organizational structure, did not exist in the first century.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anachronism&lt;/strong&gt;: the misappropriation of concepts and ideas in time.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When an actor in a movie set in the Middle Ages is wearing a digital watch, or there&amp;rsquo;s a car visible on a street that is supposed to occur during the civil war, that&amp;rsquo;s an anachronism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anachronistic fallacy&lt;/strong&gt;: when one purposely or inadvertently &lt;strong&gt;asserts or infers a concept&lt;/strong&gt; based on an anachronism.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; didn&amp;rsquo;t exist yet in the first century, every time we translate &amp;ldquo;ecclesia&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; in the New Testament, that&amp;rsquo;s an anachronistic fallacy.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fact, the word &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; in any form or language doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear until around the mid-5th Century CE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Greek word &lt;em&gt;ecclesia&lt;/em&gt;, later translated as &amp;ldquo;church,&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;called out assembly,&amp;rdquo; or in a religious context, &amp;ldquo;congregation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;ecclesia&lt;/em&gt; is about people, not an institution, yet this is not what usually comes to our mind when we see the word &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; in our Bibles. We tend to associate &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;a building or collection of (non-Jewish) worshippers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John, a Jew, wrote to Jewish congregations attended by Jews and gentiles. In the early to mid 90s, they assembled in synagogues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;To whom was the revelation &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; given?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus! This has some interesting theological implications, as there were apparently things Jesus didn&amp;rsquo;t know even after his Resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 1:1 The Revelation of Yeshua the Messiah, which God gave &lt;strong&gt;Him&lt;/strong&gt; to show to His servants the things that must soon take place. He made it known by sending His angel to His servant John,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-was-revelation-written&#34;&gt;Why was Revelation written?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revelation 1:7 &lt;mark&gt;Look! He is coming with the clouds! Every eye will see him&lt;/mark&gt;, including those who pierced Him, and all the tribes of the Land will mourn him. Yes! Amen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We mentioned above how the purpose of apocalyptic literature was to give the faithful hope during times of tribulation. No matter what happens here on earth, we always have the hope of his return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zechariah 14:4 reminds us that when he returns, His &amp;ldquo;feet will stand on the Mount of Olives.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the end of the day, Revelation is about God fixing what man and Satan have messed up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whereas we saw the entrance of sin, the curse, and death in Genesis, we will see the end of sin (chapter 21), no more condemnation (chapter 22), and no more death (chapter 21).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like Steven Covey says, &amp;ldquo;Begin with the end in mind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No matter how murky or mysterious Revelation may be, ultimately, it is about the Glory of God and restoration of Man to the state that God originally intended for us in Eden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation reminds us, &amp;ldquo;victory depends on Christ&amp;rsquo;s finished work, not on human circumstances (and) that the imminent hope of His return is worth more than all the world&amp;rsquo;s goods.&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amen!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am excited to dig into this book. I&amp;rsquo;ve studied it many times, but this will be the first time diving into using messianic and other cultural background commentaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we begin, remember the &amp;ldquo;Seven Keys to Interpretation&amp;rdquo; we listed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will have a separate segment to review the relevant history before John receives the Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if history wasn&amp;rsquo;t your best subject, I encourage you to view this supplement. Understanding this extra-biblical background turns out to be highly relevant to our studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, we&amp;rsquo;ll see you for Revelation chapter 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically Jewish apocalyptic literature fall into a category called pseudopigrapha – writings falsely ascribed to someone else describing a vision that person had. For example, the Book of (First) Enoch probably dates to 200-100 BCE (long after the Biblical Enoch was taken by God in Genesis 5). Revelation follows the genre of 1 Enoch, but it is also different because we are confident it came directly from God through John the Apostle.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believers need not be bothered by the &amp;ldquo;BCE/CE&amp;rdquo; (Before Common Era/Common Era) designations in place of &amp;ldquo;BC&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;AD&amp;rdquo;. They mean the same things. Saying BCE/CE is less offensive particularly to Jewish people. It is a chance to love our neighbors and live out Romans 12:18 (&amp;ldquo;If possible, so far as it depends on you, live in &lt;em&gt;shalom&lt;/em&gt; with all people&amp;rdquo;). Besides, when the Catholic Church established the BC/AD system in the Middle Ages, they made a math error. We now know that Yeshua was most likely born 5 or 4 BCE. Saying &amp;ldquo;Jesus Christ was born in the year 5 Before Christ&amp;rdquo; is non-sensical when you think about it!&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a supplement to our Revelation background series. We&amp;rsquo;re essentially going to take a look at significant events in the period between the Jewish Revolt of 66CE, including the destruction of the Jewish Temple in 70, through the mid-90s that resulted in John&amp;rsquo;s exile on Patmos, where he received the Revelation. Even if history wasn&amp;rsquo;t your best subject in school, I think you&amp;rsquo;ll find this helpful as we prepare to study Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than Jesus predicting the temple&amp;rsquo;s destruction in Luke 21, all of this is drawn from extra-biblical sources. Much of it is verifiable from historical documents. Still, some of it is based on church tradition that was likely passed on orally before it was written down several centuries later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church father, Iraneus, was only one generation removed from John the Apostle. Iraneus in &lt;em&gt;ecclesiastical history¸&lt;/em&gt;is the earliest source that tells us that John the Apostle wrote Revelation and did so from Patmos because the Roman Emperor Domitian exiled him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domitian&amp;rsquo;s persecution turns out to be critically important if we are to put Revelation in context. The following is summarized mainly from Cargill&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Jerusalem the Holy City&lt;/em&gt; course&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and Lancaster&amp;rsquo;s series &lt;em&gt;Apocalypse of John&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Chronicles of the Apostles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The years following Jesus&#39; Resurrection and Ascension were a tumultuous time for Israel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The governors that followed Pontius Pilate went from bad to worse, as did the Herods that took over for Antipas and Phillip, notably Agrippa I and Agrippa II&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With this came increased talk of rebellion and hopes for a Messianic deliverer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In many Jew&amp;rsquo;s minds, the Messiah will deliver the people from captivity and establish a literal political kingdom, just like Moses did during the Exodus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since Jesus didn&amp;rsquo;t do that, He couldn&amp;rsquo;t be the promised deliverer&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;False messiahs were abundant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This led to what is known as the &amp;ldquo;First Jewish Revolt&amp;rdquo; in 66 CE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-jewish-revolt-nero-vespasian-and-josephus&#34;&gt;The Jewish Revolt: Nero, Vespasian, and Josephus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/3feaa830cafd78dd620f3f1cbab7887f.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;25%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 66 CE, during the time of Emperor Nero (famous for his own persecutions and insanity), there was open rebellion; a Roman General named Vespasian (pictured at right) was sent with Roman Legions V, X, and XV to quash it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josephus predicts greatness for Vespasian.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During one battle in the north of Israel, Vespasian captured a Jewish general named Yosef ben Mattiyahu, who later became known as Flavius Josephus.&lt;img src=&#34;images/408d47525f6d48efcea99f82468abd74.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;25%&#34; style=&#34;float:left&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As he was about to be executed, Josephus said to Vespasian something along the lines of, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not really a general. I&amp;rsquo;m a prophet, and one day you&amp;rsquo;re going to be the emperor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most Roman leaders were extraordinarily superstitious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naturally, what this man said was pleasing to Vespasian&amp;rsquo;s ears; therefore, Josephus was allowed to live as an enslaved person. He authored two large volumes of Jewish history up to that point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 69, while dealing with the Jewish rebellion, Vespasian was recalled to Rome, where he was indeed named emperor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josephus also told Vespasian that amid all this Jewish messianic enthusiasm, it was &lt;em&gt;Vespasian and his line&lt;/em&gt; who fulfilled the Jewish prophecies about the coming Messiah, not some Jewish person from the house of David.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After Vespasian became emperor, they took Jewish prophecies very seriously!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josephus was still very much in the picture some 10-20 years later, when Vespasian&amp;rsquo;s son Domitian took over the Roman Empire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josephus is viewed as a traitor to the Jews for his actions.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to legend, a group of generals entered into a suicide pact rather than be captured.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josephus conveniently drew the proverbial last straw and was tasked with killing the last man and then himself. He obviously took another way when he presented himself to Vespasian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vespasian&amp;rsquo;s son Titus ultimately was successful in putting down the rebellion.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 70, he besieged and sacked Jerusalem and destroyed the Temple stone-by-stone, just as Jesus had predicted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 72, he rooted out the last Jewish holdouts at a place called Masada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those Jews who were not slaughtered were forced into exile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Jews would not have a homeland to call their own until 1948.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2nd-temple-destruction-fulfills-prophecy&#34;&gt;2nd Temple Destruction Fulfills Prophecy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/60576df31e34f2c3e4538d7811953bdc.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
Luke 19:41-44 As He drew near and saw Jerusalem, He wept over her, 42. saying, &#34;If only you had recognized this day the things that lead to shalom! But now they are hidden from your eyes. 43. For the days will come upon you when your enemies will surround you with barricades and hem you in on all sides. 44. And they will smash you to the ground—you and your children within you. And they won&#39;t leave within you one stone upon another because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus&#39; words about the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple were fulfilled in 70 CE
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indeed, not one stone was left upon another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A visit to the Temple Mount area in Jerusalem today reveals these massive stones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on the indentations in the surrounding pavement, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to conclude that they fell from the top of the temple mount above (note the person in the upper left corner for a sense of the size of the stones!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archaeologists date these stones to the 1st century and the destruction of Jerusalem by the Roman army.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The destruction of the &amp;ldquo;2nd Temple&amp;rdquo; is critical in Jewish history.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The destruction of the 1st Temple in 586 BCE was another such moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In one of those quirks of history, both destructions happened on the same day on the Jewish Calendar, the 9th day of the Jewish month of Av.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since then, several calamities have happened on that date, and to this day, the 9th of Av is a day of mourning and fasting for the Jewish People.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;roman-aftermath-vespasian-and-titus&#34;&gt;Roman aftermath: Vespasian and Titus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The destruction of the Temple was a severe blow to the hopes and aspirations of Jews
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the second time in their history, God&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;chosen people&amp;rdquo; had been decimated, exiled, and seen God&amp;rsquo;s house overrun by a pagan empire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;How could an all-powerful, all-loving God let this happen? What will we do next?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first time it happened was in 586 BCE at the hands of the Babylonians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE, Emperor Vespasian did two things to teach a lesson to this rebellious people.
&lt;img src=&#34;images/41894ca448ddd5df916ab6bc1f1e5491.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
-   This tax only applied to Jews.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He imposed a &lt;em&gt;fiscus Iudaicus&lt;/em&gt; (a Jewish Tax).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a further insult, the tax went to the upkeep of the pagan Temple of Jupiter/Zeus, which stood where the Jewish Temple once did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ancient cultures, putting your holy site over someone else&amp;rsquo;s holy site was the ultimate in &amp;ldquo;smack talk&amp;rdquo;; it communicates, &amp;ldquo;your God is vanquished.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some Jews (both followers and non-followers of Yeshua) &amp;ldquo;renounced&amp;rdquo; their faith to avoid the tax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He &amp;ldquo;gave orders that everyone who belonged to the lineage of David should be sought out that none of the royal race might be left among the Jews.&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Titus succeeded Vespasian in 79 but only reigned two years before he died of a fever.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Arch of Titus&amp;rdquo; stands in Rome today as a tribute to his victory over the Jews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/61a7daa2ad04e35e37a8668a756e01d0.png&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empathy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to put ourselves in the Jew&amp;rsquo;s shoes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our God is supposed to be all-powerful with a special place in His heart for His people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet not once but twice, God&amp;rsquo;s house, the holiest place on earth, has been overrun by idol-worshipping pagans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moreover, in the case of the first temple, God made an unconditional covenant with David that appears to have been broken. What do you do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is your God not who He says He is? Maybe he&amp;rsquo;s not that powerful. Perhaps He doesn&amp;rsquo;t love us. Maybe we sinned so severely he had no choice but to break his promise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you do when what you believe to be true is so blatantly contradicted by the evidence?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you walk away from your faith? A lot did, I&amp;rsquo;m sure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you say God would have protected us, but our people were so bad they deserved it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you say that maybe we misread or misunderstood the promises?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of people did a combination of these things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psychologists use the term &amp;ldquo;cognitive dissonance&amp;rdquo; for those times when what you believe, what you have been taught all your life doesn&amp;rsquo;t match your reality. According to Cargill, this is what the Jews in exile after the destruction of the First Temple were experiencing.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And let us not be so glib as to say, &amp;ldquo;Jesus did away with the temple.&amp;rdquo; Or &amp;ldquo;the Jews rejected Jesus, so they got what was coming.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not that simple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first apostles met in the Temple every day, and the temple was also important to Paul.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Temple was a big deal to all Jews, including those who accepted Jesus as their Messiah&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of all, they mourned.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the First Temple was destroyed, we get passages like Psalms 137.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When God&amp;rsquo;s people mourn, God listens.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the first temple destruction and the people were scattered to a foreign land, the Babylon Empire, God, sent apocalyptic visions to prophets like Ezekiel and Daniel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should not surprise us that we get a similar apocalyptic vision after the second temple was destroyed and God&amp;rsquo;s people were scattered throughout the Roman empire. This time God would make it through John the Apostle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But first, we need to talk about another Nero figure named Domitian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;domitian&#34;&gt;Domitian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the short time Titus was emperor, he softened his father&amp;rsquo;s hard-line positions, particularly concerning political prisoners. Presumably, this also included an easing of enforcement efforts on the two anti-Jewish programs instituted by his father.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All that would change under Domitian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian (emperor from 81-96) reinstituted the two programs of Vespasian &amp;ldquo;with the utmost rigor&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, In Rome, worship of the imperial cult was viewed as a symbol of loyalty to the Roman state. This included worshipping a statue or image of the emperor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whereas Vespasian and Titus weren&amp;rsquo;t significantly &amp;ldquo;religious,&amp;rdquo; Domitian, by the Josephus prophecy, believed himself to be the promised one sent by the gods. He thus demanded worship while he was still alive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He set up a temple to himself and demanded to be addressed as &amp;ldquo;my master, my lord, my god, Domitian.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is in addition to Rome&amp;rsquo;s general paranoia about foreign religions, particularly those like Judaism, whose proponents denounced Rome&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster says something significant here: &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;this fantasy made him all the more worthy of the title of antichrist.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now add to the mix that numerous gentiles throughout the empire were coming to faith in Yeshua.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul and the early leadership decided that gentiles should not be required to convert to Judaism as a condition of being accepted into the assembly (see Acts 15).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The unintended consequence meant that these converts were not Jewish and didn&amp;rsquo;t have to pay the tax&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the eyes of Domitian, they had exploited what we might call &amp;ldquo;a tax loophole.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They could worship the Jewish Messiah in a Jewish congregation but still not pay the Jewish tax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian expected to find Jewish tax evaders and deal with them accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He was not expecting to find the amounts of non-Jews throughout the empire who had forsaken Roman gods to drift into Jewish ways&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The conversions, in combination with the &amp;ldquo;tax loophole&amp;rdquo; problem, sent Domitian into a rage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People in his household were even part of this strange new religion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although Judaism was a recognized religion in the empire, it was only legal for Jews to practice it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian initially turned his wrath on the Jews for aiding and abetting these non-Jews.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to him, it was their fault for spreading and proselytizing to non-Jews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He started by banishing all Jews from the city of Rome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of them naturally protested, saying, &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not all Jews! It&amp;rsquo;s this strange sect called the &amp;lsquo;Nazarenes.&amp;rsquo; Blame them!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian next initiated a system to weed out these &amp;ldquo;secret Jews&amp;rdquo; - being a &amp;ldquo;Christian&amp;rdquo; was now punishable by death&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-believing Jews were required to become informants on their messianic brethren&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specifically, Keener notes that synagogues in Asia (modern Turkey) expelled Jewish Christians.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They &lt;strong&gt;accused&lt;/strong&gt; the gentiles in messianic fellowships of &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;saying they were Jews, but were not&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a religious standpoint, these people were violating the Torah&amp;rsquo;s requirement to &amp;ldquo;Love your neighbor as yourself&amp;rdquo; (Leviticus 19:18), as even the narrowest interpretation of &amp;ldquo;neighbor&amp;rdquo; would have included Gentiles who have attached themselves as &amp;ldquo;god fearers&amp;rdquo; and worshipped in synagogues alongside Jews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Nazis were not the first to do this. The Church led the Spanish Inquisition, which also required people to inform each other.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian had the same problem Torquemada and Hitler did. Who exactly was a Jew?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian&amp;rsquo;s answer was &amp;ldquo;anyone who lived like a Jew,&amp;rdquo; which included gentile followers of Yeshua.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was the first large-scale persecutions of Christian believers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The captives had one opportunity to dispel the charges.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They had to reject their Jewish ways, then bow and worship an image of the emperor and acknowledge that Domitian was &amp;ldquo;Lord of all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roman citizens who refused or were believed to be insincere were &amp;ldquo;mercifully&amp;rdquo; beheaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-citizens suffered a worse fate, up to and including crucifixion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He offered compassion to the wealthy: they could have their lives spared but would be exiled to an Island in the Mediterranean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;domitian-john-and-patmos16&#34;&gt;Domitian, John, and Patmos&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In many ways, it is not surprising that Domitian and John crossed paths since John was the last of the original &lt;em&gt;Talmidim&lt;/em&gt; of Yeshua.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian ordered the arrest and extradition of John back to Rome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are several traditions associated with John&amp;rsquo;s arrest and trial before Domitian.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When it was time to execute John, Domitian first made him drink a cup of poison, but true to Jesus&amp;rsquo;s words (Mark 16:18), the poison did not harm him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, the ancient historian Tertullian records the deaths of Peter and Paul and the attempted death of John in Rome: &amp;ldquo;John was plunged unhurt into burning oil.&amp;rdquo; Another legend was that he was shaved from head to toe first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To bring us up to the time of Revelation, &amp;ldquo;When even the cauldron did not deter John from preaching Christ, by order of Domitian, he was relegated to the Island of Patmos.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because John wouldn&amp;rsquo;t die, Domitian exercised his last legal option to exile John to Patmos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At Patmos, John received the famous Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This fulfilled Jesus&#39; prophecy that &amp;ldquo;some of you here will not taste death until you see the Son of Man coming in Glory.&amp;rdquo; (Matthew 16:21)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, we can see that the world intended martyrdom for John, fulfilling Jesus&#39; prediction that James and John would indeed drink Jesus&#39; Cup of Suffering. (Matthew 20:23)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a post-script, the next emperor, Nerva, is recorded as being &amp;ldquo;wise and moderate.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Nerva released all the political prisoners, and John returned to Ephesus for the remainder of his days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion-relevance-to-revelation&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Relevance to Revelation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this background, keep the following in mind as we work through Revelation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose one wanted to indirectly refer to Rome (the people who destroyed the 2nd Temple).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In that case, he/she might compare them to the people who destroyed the 1st Temple: &lt;strong&gt;Babylon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose one wanted to refer to Domitian indirectly.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In that case, he/she might compare to an emperor who had a similar style: &lt;strong&gt;Nero&lt;/strong&gt; (whose name has a mathematical equivalent of &amp;ldquo;666&amp;rdquo; – we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss when we get to Revelation 13).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose one wanted to indirectly refer to a false messiah who demanded to be worshipped as &amp;ldquo;my master, my lord, my god.&amp;rdquo; In other words, this person required people to use titles rightly reserved for Jesus.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In that case, he/she might use the term &lt;strong&gt;Antichrist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose one wanted to indirectly refer to non-believing Jewish informants, who accused believing gentiles of &amp;ldquo;saying they were Jews when they were not.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In that case, we might say they were from the &amp;ldquo;synagogue of the accuser,&amp;rdquo; or since the Hebrew word for &amp;ldquo;accuser&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;satan,&amp;rdquo; we could say they are from the &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;synagogue of Satan&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;Satan&lt;/em&gt; is Hebrew for &amp;ldquo;accuser&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This does not mean that they were worshipping Satan the way we might think of it with satanic rituals and such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could say that they were doing Satan&amp;rsquo;s bidding.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we accuse another believer, either directly or through gossip, guess what?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are acting as an &amp;ldquo;accuser of the brethren.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further, one who claimed to be Jewish but informed against his neighbor is not upholding the high ethical standards of Judaism. He is a hypocrite. He is saying he is a Jew but is not acting like one. Thus we can apply the phrase &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;those who say they are Jews but are not.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please note this is spoken ONLY against those Jews who failed to uphold the high ethical standards expected of Jews by denouncing their neighbors to the authorities. This is not an indictment against all Jews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus, as a Jew, obviously would not label Himself as one &amp;ldquo;who said He was a Jew but was not.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If one were going to praise believers who stood up to the authorities, we might say they &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Held fast to His Name&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When John was arrested and taken to Rome, he had little hope for survival.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To a Jewish mind, John was &amp;ldquo;dead&amp;rdquo; as soon as the order for extradition came. See Hebrews 11:19.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Revelation 11, when John writes of two witnesses martyred for their testimony but who God raises from the dead, John&amp;rsquo;s audience could have thought, &amp;ldquo;oh, just like He raised John from the dead.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get the idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So much of Revelation is unlocked when we understand the context. We will open more as we progress through the study.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the primary reason why traditional Jews today can’t accept Jesus as their messiah. The deplorable treatment of Jews by the Church over the centuries has cemented this position in their minds.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall the “no friend of Caesar” exchange in John 19:12.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are differing views on this. Lancaster suggests that non-Jewish believers were not liable to pay the tax. When Domitian learned of this, enforcement became the cover story for Domitian&amp;rsquo;s intense persecutions of Christians. However, the Wikipedia article, &amp;ldquo;Fiscus Judaecus,&amp;rdquo; references scholars who suggest that since neither the Romans nor the Christians themselves viewed Christianity as a separate religion, non-Jewish believers in the first century were equally subject to the tax. I&amp;rsquo;m sympathetic to both views. Perhaps it was not as big of an issue under Vespasian as it was under Domitian, which is Lancaster&amp;rsquo;s frame of reference.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Hebrews 11:19, in Abraham&amp;rsquo;s mind, Isaac was &amp;ldquo;dead&amp;rdquo; as soon as God gave the command to sacrifice. The journey from Beersheva to Jerusalem took three days. Therefore, figuratively and typologically, Isaac rose from the dead on the third day.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This is the revelation which God gave to Yeshua the Messiah, so that he could show his servants what must happen very soon. He communicated it by sending his angel to his servant Yochanan, 2. who bore witness to the Word of God and to the testimony of Yeshua the Messiah, as much as he saw. 3. Blessed are the reader and hearers of the words of this prophecy, provided they obey the things written in it! For the time is near! 4. From: Yochanan To: The seven Messianic communities in the province of Asia: Grace and shalom to you from the One who is, who was and who is coming; from the sevenfold Spirit before his throne; 5. and from Yeshua the Messiah, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead and the ruler of the earth&amp;rsquo;s kings. To him, the one who loves us, who has freed us from our sins at the cost of his blood, 6. who has caused us to be a kingdom, that is, cohanim for God, his Father—to him be the glory and the rulership forever and ever. Amen. 7. Look! He is coming with the clouds! Every eye will see him, including those who pierced him; and all the tribes of the Land will mourn him. Yes! Amen! 8. &amp;ldquo;I am the &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;Z,&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; says Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, the One who is, who was and who is coming. 9. I, Yochanan, am a brother of yours and a fellow-sharer in the suffering, kingship and perseverance that come from being united with Yeshua. I had been exiled to the island called Patmos for having proclaimed the message of God and borne witness to Yeshua. 10. I came to be, in the Spirit, on the Day of the Lord; and I heard behind me a loud voice, like a trumpet, 11. saying, &amp;ldquo;Write down what you see on a scroll, and send it to the seven Messianic communities—Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;1:1 Daniel 2:28 but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream and the visions of your head as you lay in bed are these: 29 To you, O king, as you lay in bed came thoughts of what would be after this, and he who reveals mysteries made known to you what is to be.&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Allusions and Cross-References&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
We believe your study of this amazing book will be greatly enhanced if you read and meditate on the allusions listed. A comprehensive listing for all 22 chapters, including cross-references from the Treasury of Scripture Knowledge, is in Appendix A1.
&lt;p&gt;As you hover over (or tap) on each verse, the text of the English Standard Version will appear.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;this-is-the-revelation&#34;&gt;This is the Revelation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have several questions answered immediately in verse 1.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who wrote: John&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is it for: servants of Yeshua (not for unbelievers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is it about: Yeshua&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When should we study: immediately for the time is near&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we noted in the introduction, this is &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; revelation, so the book&amp;rsquo;s name is Revelation, not &amp;ldquo;revelations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John&amp;rsquo;s Hebrew name, Yochanan, means something like &amp;ldquo;blessed by God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although the original record we have is in Greek and John was multilingual, Jesus very likely communicated this in Hebrew, John&amp;rsquo;s primary language.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, Hebrew words for &amp;ldquo;revelation&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;exile&amp;rdquo; are linguistically related.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;גָלָה is the verb for &amp;ldquo;to reveal, uncover&amp;rdquo; and is pronounced &amp;ldquo;ga-LAH&amp;rdquo;; גָלוּת, &amp;ldquo;ga-LOOT,&amp;rdquo; is the word for exile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewish apocryphal writings, of which Revelation is included, tend to occur when the people were exiled by God, living outside the land when they were vulnerable to abuses by the pagan nations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we mentioned in the introduction, one of the purposes of Jewish apocalyptic literature was for God to communicate to His people that He is still in control. Although things seem unfair now, a day is coming when God will set everything straight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To help capture the &amp;ldquo;Jewishness&amp;rdquo; of the book, we will be using the Complete Jewish Bible (CJB) paraphrase translation.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No translation is perfect, and the CJB is not without problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can hover over any Bible reference and compare the English Standard Version (ESV). Often the King James Version does the best job at capturing the meaning of the Greek.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;godyeshuaangelyochanan&#34;&gt;God/Yeshua/Angel/Yochanan&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that we receive Revelation, &amp;ldquo;4th hand.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God gave it to Jesus, who gave it to an angel/messenger, who gave it to John, who wrote it down and communicated to the servants of Messiah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John is not receiving all of this directly from Jesus but through an angel who bears witness to Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the end of the chapter, we will be practically unable to distinguish who is speaking, even though we know from verse 1 that it must be the angel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This concept is very similar to the &amp;ldquo;Angel of the LORD&amp;rdquo; that we see in the Old Testament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We often presume this angel is a pre-incarnate version of Jesus, but it may not be that simple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There appears to be an &amp;ldquo;Angel of the Messiah,&amp;rdquo; just like an &amp;ldquo;Angel of the LORD.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This angel has the full authority to speak to John, just as if it were Jesus Himself speaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lizorkin and Shir discuss the challenges of figuring out who is speaking in Revelation:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;As in any complex composition, such a rich polyphony of heavenly sound will demand careful and attentive listening to clearly distinguish between the voices and appreciate both their choir-like message and the voice of the individual performers.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chapter one reveals that John&amp;rsquo;s concept of the &amp;ldquo;Trinity&amp;rdquo; may not be fully in keeping with the traditional Protestant view
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protestants see the Trinity as three co-equal persons. Still, throughout Revelation and even in the Gospel of John, Jesus is subordinate to the Father.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In verse 1, we see that Jesus had to learn about Revelation from the Father.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the doctrine of the Trinity is undoubtedly biblical, we must remember it is a man-made concept – the word &amp;ldquo;trinity&amp;rdquo; never appears in the Bible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We would be wise to loosely hold any man-made ideas (including views on Eschatology) as we work through Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let the Spirit pour into us as we check everything out against Scripture!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;servants&#34;&gt;Servants&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Greek word for servants is &lt;em&gt;doulos&lt;/em&gt; which we can translate as &amp;ldquo;bondservants.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bondservant is one who freely and willingly attaches himself to the household of his master, &amp;ldquo;because he loves you and your household since he is well-off with you.&amp;rdquo; (Deut 15:16-17)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As talmidim of Jesus, we are called to be His bondservants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This book is for us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we go through the book, we will highlight some of the patterns of seven that may not be obvious. The callout box below lists the seven instances of &amp;ldquo;Messiah&amp;rdquo; in Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Seven Messiah verses in Revelation&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;ldquo;Messiah&amp;rdquo; (Christ) appears seven times, starting with 1:1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the revelation which God gave to Yeshua the &lt;strong&gt;Messiah&lt;/strong&gt;, so that he could show his servants what must happen very soon. He communicated it by sending his angel to his servant Yochanan (Rev 1:1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who bore witness to the Word of God and to the testimony of Yeshua the &lt;strong&gt;Messiah&lt;/strong&gt;, as much as he saw. (Rev 1:2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and from Yeshua the &lt;strong&gt;Messiah&lt;/strong&gt;, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the earth&amp;rsquo;s kings. To him, the one who loves us, who has freed us from our sins at the cost of his blood, (Rev 1:5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seventh angel sounded his shofar; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, &amp;ldquo;The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and his &lt;strong&gt;Messiah&lt;/strong&gt;, and he will rule forever and ever!&amp;rdquo; (Rev 11:15)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, &amp;ldquo;Now have come God&amp;rsquo;s victory, power and kingship, and the authority of his &lt;strong&gt;Messiah&lt;/strong&gt;; because the Accuser of our brothers, who accuses them day and night before God, has been thrown out! (Rev 12:10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I saw thrones, and those seated on them received authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for testifying about Yeshua and proclaiming the Word of God, also those who had not worshipped the beast or its image and had not received the mark on their foreheads and on their hands. They came to life and ruled with the &lt;strong&gt;Messiah&lt;/strong&gt; for a thousand years. (Rev 20:4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blessed and holy is anyone who has a part in the first resurrection; over him the second death has no power. On the contrary, they will be cohanim of God and of the &lt;strong&gt;Messiah&lt;/strong&gt;, and they will rule with him for the thousand years. (Rev 20:6)
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-12-bore-witness&#34;&gt;Rev 1:2: Bore Witness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who &lt;mark&gt;bore witness&lt;/mark&gt; to the Word of God and to the &lt;mark&gt;testimony&lt;/mark&gt; of Yeshua the Messiah, as much as he saw.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;bore-witnesstestimony&#34;&gt;Bore witness/testimony&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John loves courtroom language (witness, testimony, testify, judge, judgment, authority (in the sense of legal standing), etc.). There are over 100 examples of this in John&amp;rsquo;s writings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John uses nearly the identical language in John 3:32-33 as he does in Revelation 1:2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Gospel, John portrayed evidence that Jesus was the proper authority. At the same time, the Jerusalem religious establishment were the usurpers, &amp;ldquo;bad shepherds,&amp;rdquo; an illegitimate regime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Revelation, he&amp;rsquo;s going to magnify that. The entire corrupt world system, not just the corrupt Jerusalem establishment, will be put on trial by God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, remember the context: believers in Asia were being betrayed to Roman courts. God grants true justice and righteous judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Seven Testimony verses&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
There are seven &#34;**Testimony**&#34; verses starting with 1:2. We can look at this list in a couple of ways.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are seven verses with &amp;ldquo;testimony&amp;rdquo; appearing twice in 19:10.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seven &amp;ldquo;Testimony of Jesus&amp;rdquo; references
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can remove 11:7 where &amp;ldquo;testimony &lt;strong&gt;of Jesus&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; is not directly implied – the two witnesses are testifying of God&amp;rsquo;s judgment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12:11 is directly implied as being martyred for their testimony of Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We count 19:10 twice for a total of seven&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who bore witness to the word of God and to the &lt;strong&gt;testimony of Jesus&lt;/strong&gt; Christ, even to all that he saw. (Rev 1:2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I, John, your brother and partner in the tribulation and the kingdom and the patient endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos on account of the word of God and the &lt;strong&gt;testimony of Jesus.&lt;/strong&gt; (Rev 1:9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;And when they have finished their&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;testimony&lt;/strong&gt;*, the beast that rises from the bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer them and kill them, (Rev 11:7)*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their &lt;strong&gt;testimony (of Jesus)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; for they loved not their lives even unto death. (Rev 12:11)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then the dragon became furious with the woman and went off to make war on the rest of her offspring, on those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the &lt;strong&gt;testimony of Jesus&lt;/strong&gt;. And he stood on the sand of the sea. (Rev 12:17)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, &amp;ldquo;You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold to the &lt;strong&gt;testimony of Jesus&lt;/strong&gt;. Worship God.&amp;rdquo; For the &lt;strong&gt;testimony of Jesus&lt;/strong&gt; is the Spirit of prophecy. (Rev 19:10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the &lt;strong&gt;testimony of Jesus&lt;/strong&gt; and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. (Rev 20:4)
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-13-the-blessing&#34;&gt;Rev 1:3: The Blessing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessed are the reader and hearers of the words of this prophecy, provided they obey the things written in it! For the time is near!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-blessing&#34;&gt;The blessing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the first of seven such blessings in the book (see callout below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation is the only book with such an explicit promise.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s no wonder the enemy tries to tell us it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to understand, and many have a spirit of fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversely, when believers wonder how they can be blessed by God, a biblical answer is &amp;ldquo;study Revelation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We aren&amp;rsquo;t told what form the blessing will be, but ANY gift from God will be great.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One such blessing may be that approaching Revelation as a Jewish book means you will read nearly 1000 verses from the Old Testament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another blessing is that we will walk away with a much more complete picture of our Savior&amp;rsquo;s person, mission, and destiny than we may have had previously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Greek carries the sense of read-aloud. Most people did not have their own copies of the Bible, so they would have had to hear it read aloud by the reader in the synagogue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that the blessing is conditional upon the reader understanding and obeying
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is very Hebraic. In Hebrew, verbs are action-oriented.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In English, we can listen, but we don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily equate hearing with obedience. In other words, we can listen passively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no such thought in Hebrew. If you don&amp;rsquo;t obey, you aren&amp;rsquo;t listening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stern writes, &amp;ldquo;in Judaism, learning is supposed to lead to doing.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the 18th century, a Christian Hebraist named Franz Delitzsch translated the New Testament from Greek back into Biblical Hebrew, using forms and idioms the Old Testament uses. It is a highly educated guess on what the original Jewish authors might have said had their works recorded in their original Hebrew.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Revelation 1:3, he used a verb that frequently appears in the Torah of Moses – hear/obey (Shema) – שָׁמַע. This beautiful Hebrew word is rich with meaning and application. Talmidim hear and obey the words of Yeshua. Most notably, the word appears in Deut 6:4, which is the famous &amp;ldquo;Shema Israel&amp;rdquo; passage, which Jesus quotes in Mark 12:29.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;שְׁמַ֖ע&lt;/em&gt; יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵ֖ינוּ יְהוָ֥ה ׀ אֶחָֽד׃&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then Deuteronomy verse 5 continues, &amp;ldquo;You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;hear&amp;rdquo; is followed by a list of behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in a Name?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also contained within the word שָׁמַע are the letters שׁ and מ. When we put those together, we get שֶׁם (shem), which is the Hebrew word for name (Hebrew has five letters that are spelled differently when at the end of a word. The mem (מ/ם) is one of those).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your name is not just a string of letters. In Hebraic thought, your name is your reputation and your character. Being an obedient listener and one who diligently keeps/guards God&amp;rsquo;s word reflects on our reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, when we take on the name of Yeshua, we must positively reflect His character. We do that by keeping and guarding His words. In a sense this could be the third commandment. When we fail to keep and guard his name, we could be said to be taking on his name in vain. Conversely, there is a blessing to be had when we keep obey and guard His reputation.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;very-soon-and-for-the-time-is-near&#34;&gt;Very soon and for the time is near!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John believed the fulfillment of all things was very near.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He did not mean merely within a few years and certainly did not mean two thousand years! He is writing with a sense of urgency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fact, we can defend from Scripture that the New Testament authors didn&amp;rsquo;t just believe the &amp;ldquo;end times&amp;rdquo; were near; they thought the end times were upon them.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See 1 Corinthians 10:11 and note that Paul directly connects the Old Testament with the &amp;ldquo;end times.&amp;rdquo; Further, the &amp;ldquo;end times&amp;rdquo; IS the fulfillment of Old Testament Prophecies.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The above point is critically important to keep in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul and John weren&amp;rsquo;t looking to events occurring in the world around them; they were looking to the &amp;ldquo;fulfillment of the purposes and prophecies of the Old Testament.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An alternate sense could be once the events commence, they will unfold rapidly;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 Peter 3:3-4 seems to imply Peter at least suspected there would be some delay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet, at the end of the passage (2 Peter 3:10), Peter says every believer should be alert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Seven Blessings&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are seven &lt;em&gt;berachot&lt;/em&gt; (blessings) starting with 1:3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed&lt;/strong&gt; are the reader and hearers of the words of this prophecy, provided they obey the things written in it! For the time is near! (Rev 1:3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed&lt;/strong&gt; are the dead who die in the Lord (Rev 14:13).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed&lt;/strong&gt; is he that watches and keeps his garments (Rev 16:15).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed&lt;/strong&gt; are they who are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb (Rev 19:9).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed&lt;/strong&gt; and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection (Rev 20:6).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed&lt;/strong&gt; is he that keeps the words of the prophecy of this book (Rev 22:7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed&lt;/strong&gt; are they that wash their robes (Rev 22:14).
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-14-grace-and-shalom&#34;&gt;Rev 1:4: Grace and Shalom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Revelation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;OT Allusions&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4. From: Yochanan To: The seven Messianic communities in the province of Asia:  Grace and shalom to you from the One who is, who was and who is coming; from the sevenfold Spirit before his throne;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1:4 Isa 11: 2 And the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;from-yochananjohn&#34;&gt;From Yochanan/John&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While we can&amp;rsquo;t be 100% certain, most conservative scholars believe this is John the Apostle (see the introductory lesson for more background)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whichever John this was, we might say &amp;ldquo;he needed no introduction.&amp;rdquo; We are given no further background than &amp;ldquo;John,&amp;rdquo; indicating that he was well-known to his audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several early church writers believed the letter was a forgery and argued that the book should not become part of the New Testament canon.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They based this view partly because the Greek of Revelation is borderline substandard quality, particularly compared to the Gospel of John.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This may be explained. The Gospel was composed with a translator, someone learned in Greek, which John was not. On Patmos, John was left with his limited Greek skills.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;seven-communitieschurches&#34;&gt;Seven communities/&amp;ldquo;churches&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/49f033022fe7e954bd6946926032fbc0.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immediately there is underlying tension we might miss.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are in Asia. Modern Turkey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jews aren&amp;rsquo;t supposed to be outside Eretz Israel (the land of Israel)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a big clue that things are out of order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the end of the book, they will be back in the Land&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We talked about this anachronism of the word &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; during the introduction.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The church, either an institution or a gathering of people, did not exist when John wrote.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is hard not to call them &amp;ldquo;the seven churches.&amp;rdquo; If we do, we need to be aware of the anachronism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number &amp;ldquo;seven&amp;rdquo; is a fingerprint of the Holy Spirit and speaks of completeness and fulfillment. It can also carry a sense of holiness/set apartness-the Shabbat (7th day) is a time to be set apart from the other six days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whatever other interpretations of Revelation may be plausible, we must remember first and foremost it was written to actual first-century congregations with real struggles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we look at a map&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, the seven cities are in relative proximity. We can easily imagine the letter starting in Ephesus and traveling clockwise to Smyrna, using the Roman road system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, there were many more than seven congregations in Asia (one received a letter from Paul, Colossians).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t exactly know why these seven were called out
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indeed, these seven had real problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problems are likely typical of what other fellowships were going through at the time.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each letter will end with &amp;ldquo;hear what the Spirit says to the church&lt;em&gt;es&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; (i.e., the words are directed to all fellowships, not just the specific one addressed).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster speculates that many fellowships likely existed in each town. In other words, there was probably not merely one assembly in Ephesus.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He says that although it is unlikely there were separate fellowships for Gentiles (as the Jew/Gentile split in Christianity had not yet occurred, or at best was only in its infancy), there may have been separate meetings for Believers in Messiah that were distinct from other Jewish fellowships.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This could explain why some believers had been arrested and martyred, but others in the same town had not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;grace-and-shalom-peace&#34;&gt;Grace and Shalom (Peace)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This could be a combination of the Greek &lt;em&gt;Charis&lt;/em&gt; (grace) and the Hebrew &lt;em&gt;shalom&lt;/em&gt; (peace)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr Bolen writes: &amp;ldquo;the greeting seems to combine a common formulaic openings in Greco-Roman and Semitic letters.&amp;rdquo; Grace&amp;rdquo; (Gk. charis, χάρις) is related to the common Greek word &amp;ldquo;greetings&amp;rdquo; (Gk. chairein, χαίρειν) as seen in Acts 15:23, 23:26, and James 1:1 (cf. Matt 26:49, Mark 15:18, Luke 1:28, and John 19:3). &amp;ldquo;Peace&amp;rdquo; (Gk. eirēnē, εἰρήνη; Heb. shalōm, שָׁלוֹם) is a common Semitic greeting as seen in Luke 10:5, 24:36, and John 20:19.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potentially, both meanings are encompassed by the rich Hebrew word &lt;em&gt;shalom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dan Stolebarger says that when we wish someone &amp;ldquo;shalom,&amp;rdquo; we are wishing them &amp;ldquo;peace as it was before the Fall.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;True Shalom comes when God makes everything right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-trinity&#34;&gt;The Trinity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verses 4-5 are widely and correctly viewed as &lt;strong&gt;the Trinity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this case, the order is Father, Spirit, Son, which is consistent with John&amp;rsquo;s overall view that Jesus is (somehow) subordinate to the Father. It is the Spirit who empowers the Son.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Father – John uses an identical phrase as the Septuagint translation of Exodus 3:14.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Hebrew, this is unmistakable. “I am who I am” אֶֽהְיֶ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶֽהְיֶ֑ה (ehyeh asher eheyh).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general terms, God is transcendent. Missler says, &amp;ldquo;Time is a physical property subject to mass acceleration and gravity. God&amp;rsquo;s not subject to those. God is not someone with lots of time. He&amp;rsquo;s outside our time domain altogether. He knows the end from the beginning.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that the &amp;ldquo;Father&amp;rdquo; is also described as One who…&amp;rdquo; is coming&amp;rdquo; – we usually think of Jesus, the Son, as the One who is coming again. Still, in some sense, the Father is also coming.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Zechariah 14:4, Adonai will set His foot upon the Mount of Olives. The text doesn&amp;rsquo;t say, &amp;ldquo;Messiah will set foot upon the Mount of Olives.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In some places in Scripture, we see some distinction among the roles.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus sits at the right hand of the Father (Acts 2:33)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus doesn&amp;rsquo;t pray to Himself or the Spirit, but to the Father, and says His job is to glorify the Father. (John 17:1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In others, we see a blurring of roles.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both Adonai, whom we usually view as &amp;ldquo;The Father,&amp;rdquo; and Jesus say, &amp;ldquo;I am the first and the last.&amp;rdquo; (Father in Rev 1:8, Son in Rev 1:17).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul says the Spirit caused Jesus to rise from the Dead (Rom 8:11), and he also says it was the Father (Gal 1:1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In several locations, Jesus says He is the &amp;ldquo;I AM&amp;rdquo; of our Old Testament.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lizorkin and Shir phrase it like this: &amp;ldquo;The Son and the Father are distinct, but somehow so connected that they cannot always be distinguished.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the better comparisons I&amp;rsquo;ve heard to describe the Trinity is as three partners in a corporation. Each partner may act independently, but legally the corporation is one unit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All models are clumsy because we are trying to describe the infiniteness of God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bottom line is the more we can remain flexible in our concepts of the Trinity, the less befuddling Revelation will be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sevenfold-spirit&#34;&gt;Sevenfold Spirit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This could also be rendered &amp;ldquo;seven spirits.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number seven represents completeness. Therefore &amp;ldquo;sevenfold Spirit&amp;rdquo; is likely simply describing the Spirit as the complete and perfect Spirit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewish tradition sees seven archangels.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster and Lizorkin/Shir dive into this in their commentaries and believe this is potentially in John&amp;rsquo;s view, given his Jewish background. They connect this verse with the seven angels that repeatedly appear in the book.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster notes the parallel in the description of the person giving the revelation between Revelation 1:9-18 and Daniel 10.  In Daniel 10, the messenger is clearly a supernatural angel, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a member of the Trinity.  We will discuss this further in the next lesson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lizorkin and Shir are also skeptical of the connection to Isaiah 11:2, which is often cited as a parallel passage. &amp;ldquo;This does not explain why there are seven spirits mentioned in Revelation.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They caution that we may be force-reading our view of the trinity into this passage when that may not be what John intended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Seven angels&amp;rdquo; appear repeatedly in Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;td&gt;5. and from Yeshua the Messiah, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead and the ruler of the earth&amp;rsquo;s kings. To him, the one who loves us, who has freed us from our sins at the cost of his blood,  6. who has caused us to be a kingdom, that is, Cohanim for God, his Father—to him be the glory and the rulership forever and ever. Amen.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1:5 Gen 49: 11 Binding his foal to the vine and his donkey&amp;rsquo;s colt to the choice vine, he has washed his garments in wine and his vesture in the blood of grapes. Psa 89:27 And I will make him the firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.   1:6 Ex 19:5-6 Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; 6 and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&#39; These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel.&amp;rdquo; Isa 61:6 but you shall be called the priests of the LORD; they shall speak of you as the ministers of our God; you shall eat the wealth of the nations, and in their glory you shall boast.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;firstborn-of-the-dead&#34;&gt;Firstborn of the dead&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not to say that Jesus was the first ever to be raised from the dead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Judaism, &amp;ldquo;firstborn&amp;rdquo; is a title of inheritance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The firstborn would receive a double-portion.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While usually, this was the eldest son, the eldest son could forfeit the title of firstborn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joseph was the 11th of Jacob&amp;rsquo;s 12 sons, yet was the titular Firstborn who received a double portion of Jacob&amp;rsquo;s inheritance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Jewish feast of firstfruits is also in view (always on Sunday after Passover).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This title is synonymous with victory .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because Jesus conquered death, we can (and will!) too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ruler-of-the-earths-kingsone-who-loves-usfreed-uscaused-us-to-be-cohanim-priests&#34;&gt;Ruler of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s Kings/One who loves us/Freed us/Caused us to be Cohanim (priests)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1 Corinthians 15 (the &amp;ldquo;resurrection chapter&amp;rdquo;), Paul connects the dots – since Jesus is the firstborn of the dead, He will come again and &amp;ldquo;hand over the Kingdom to God the Father, after having put an end to every rulership, yes, to every authority and power.&amp;rdquo; (1Co 15:24)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To an audience fearful of persecution, these words remind them who is truly in charge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversely, the challenge for us is whether we have indeed submitted to his kingship, or are we still telling Him, &amp;ldquo;I got this&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we submit to Him, it&amp;rsquo;s good to know that He loves us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation tells the outcome for those who tell God, &amp;ldquo;I got this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exodus 19:5-6: Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&#39; These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of this has to do with how we spend our time in this life.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Seven components to the description of Messiah&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is the faithful witness (or &amp;ldquo;the faithful martyr&amp;rdquo;; see Rev_2:13).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is the firstborn (or &amp;ldquo;foremost, chief&amp;rdquo;) of those who get raised from the dead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is the ruler of the earth&amp;rsquo;s kings, the &amp;ldquo;King of Kings&amp;rdquo; (Rev_17:14, Rev_19:16) who will one day subject to himself even the most unbridled and oppressive governments (1Co_15:24-25).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He loves us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He causes us to be freed from our sins at the cost of his blood (that is, by his bloody, sacrificial death; see Rom_3:24).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He causes us to be a kingdom, a community subject to him who loves us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He causes us to be cohanim (&amp;ldquo;priests&amp;rdquo;) for God, his Father.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern notes that the first three attributes would have brought immediate comfort to the faithful. Because He loves us, we gain the final three &amp;ldquo;benefits&amp;rdquo; as we might call them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Sevens: &amp;lsquo;Amen!&amp;rsquo;&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen is a Hebrew word that connotes &amp;ldquo;truth&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;may it be so.&amp;rdquo; Every time you say &amp;ldquo;amen,&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;re speaking Hebrew! Yay you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who has caused us to be a kingdom, that is, cohanim for God, his Father—to him be the glory and the rulership forever and ever. &lt;strong&gt;Amen&lt;/strong&gt;. (Rev 1:6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look! He is coming with the clouds! Every eye will see him, including those who pierced him; and all the tribes of the Land will mourn him. Yes! &lt;strong&gt;Amen&lt;/strong&gt;! (Rev 1:7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Laodicea, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the &lt;strong&gt;Amen&lt;/strong&gt;, the faithful and true witness, the Ruler of God&amp;rsquo;s creation: (Rev 3:14)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The four living beings said, &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Amen&lt;/strong&gt;!&amp;rdquo; and the elders fell down and worshipped. (Rev 5:14)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Amen! &amp;ldquo;Praise and glory, wisdom and thanks, honor and power and strength belong to our God forever and ever! &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Amen&lt;/strong&gt;!&amp;rdquo; (Rev 7:12)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The twenty-four elders and the four living beings fell down and worshipped God, sitting on the throne, and said, &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Amen&lt;/strong&gt;! Halleluyah!&amp;rdquo; (Rev 19:4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The one who is testifying to these things says, &amp;lsquo;Yes, I am coming soon!&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;Amen&lt;/strong&gt;! Come, Lord Yeshua! (Rev 22:20)

&lt;td&gt;7. Look! He is coming with the clouds! Every eye will see him, including those who pierced him; and all the tribes of the Land will mourn him. Yes! Amen!  8. &amp;ldquo;I am the &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;Z,&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; says Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, the One who is, who was and who is coming.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1:7 Dan 7:13-14 &amp;ldquo;I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. &lt;br&gt;Zech 12:10-14 &amp;ldquo;And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and pleas for mercy, so that, when they look on me, on him whom they have pierced, they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only child, and weep bitterly over him, as one weeps over a firstborn. 11 On that day the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning for Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo. 12 The land shall mourn, each family by itself: the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves; 13 the family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself, and their wives by themselves; 14 and all the families that are left, each by itself, and their wives by themselves. &lt;br&gt; 1:8 Isa 41:4 Who has performed and done this, calling the generations from the beginning? I, the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;look-behold-he-comes&#34;&gt;Look! Behold He comes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hebrew word for &amp;ldquo;behold&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;hinei&amp;rdquo; and it frequently appears in the Old Testament
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may have learned that the word &amp;ldquo;therefore&amp;rdquo; is a clue, particularly in Paul&amp;rsquo;s writings. The saying goes, &amp;ldquo;whenever you see a &amp;lsquo;therefore,&amp;rsquo; you always want to ask, &amp;lsquo;what is it there for?&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conceptually the same is true for &amp;ldquo;behold&amp;rdquo; in the Old Testament. The author is calling something to our attention in the narrative. We want to make sure we know what is we are beholding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Hineini!  הִנֵנִי&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely related to the word &amp;ldquo;hinei&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;heneini.&amp;rdquo; In Genesis 22, when God calls out,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Avraham! Avraham!&amp;rdquo; Abraham answers in Hebrew, &amp;ldquo;Hineini!&amp;rdquo; – translated as &amp;ldquo;here am I&amp;rdquo; but also the purpose of Behold, me! In the sense of &amp;ldquo;I am available, pick me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah also says &amp;ldquo;Hineini&amp;rdquo; in Isaiah 6:8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an expression that God values your &lt;em&gt;avail&lt;/em&gt;ability more than he values your ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a great Hebrew prayer, just tell God, &amp;ldquo;Hineini!&amp;rdquo; Look! I&amp;rsquo;m available!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;clouds&#34;&gt;Clouds&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare Acts 1:11 – He will return very similar to how He ascended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel 7 talks about the Messiah emerging from clouds and going before the Ancient of Days. There the Father gives the Son all things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A minor note that whoever is speaking switches to the 3rd person in verse seven, and then God will take over in Verse 8. Figuring out who is speaking is not nearly as important as the truth of the words spoken. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to notice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-tribes-will-mourn&#34;&gt;The tribes will mourn&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protestant/Pre-tribulation theology holds that once these events happen, there may be little, if any, hope for any unbeliever to repent, least of all traditional Jews who are cursed for rejecting their Messiah and forfeited all of their promises to the Church. This view stems from Replacement Theology. See the callout note below for additional information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zechariah 13:11 tells a different story. They will mourn him but that not the end of the story.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The people specifically from the House of David will be cleansed from their sins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore a &amp;ldquo;terminal&amp;rdquo; judgment may not be what John is communicating in verse 7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mourning may be that of a repentant heart; the same heart we should have when we ponder the price He truly paid for us. Through his sacrifice, all the families of the Earth shall be blessed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Replacement Theology&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a personal note, ever since my first trip to Israel in 2010, my eyes have been more open to the fact that we hold in our hands a single book, which in the hands of gentile church leaders all but stripped it of its Jewishness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, come to find our Messiah/Christ is Jewish. All the writers of the New Testament were Jewish. As best we can tell, Luke was a gentile convert to Judaism. The Bible, first and foremost, is about the redemption of Israel and the coming Messianic Kingdom; Revelation is the culmination of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roman 11 says the Gentiles have been grafted in and should not boast about our superiority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a nasty theory that goes by the name of Replacement Theology, which says that because Israel rejected and crucified her Messiah, all the promises meant for Israel in the Old Testament now have their spiritual fulfillment in the Church. Other components include the beliefs that Jesus and Paul forsook their Judaism and founded a gentile religion. It is said that Jesus was a sabbath breaker and Paul disregarded the dietary laws. All of these are provable as false if we do Acts 17:11 research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with this general theory is it makes God an untrustworthy liar, the Old Testament irrelevant, the law as opposite of grace, and causes us to see Jews as enemies. Replacement Theology is a tare that the enemy has planted, which has grown up alongside the nutritious kernels of solid doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must guard against Replacement Theology as this violates the two great commandments. If we view God as able to break His promises, how can we say we &amp;ldquo;love the Lord our God with our whole hearts, minds, and strengths?&amp;rdquo; If we ascribe the evil deeds of what may have been less than 20 corrupt religious leaders and blame an entire race of people, how can we say we &amp;ldquo;love our neighbors as ourselves?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Replacement Theology is a lie that has been repeated so often for the last 1500 years that it seeps into otherwise educated and insightful men writing contemporary commentaries. I may agree with 90% of everything else a given commentator says but if there is even a hint of Replacement Theology, I&amp;rsquo;m going to do my best to call it out and correct the errant conclusion.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;8. &amp;ldquo;I am the &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;Z,&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; says Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, the One who is, who was and who is coming.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1:8 Isa 41:4 Who has performed and done this, calling the generations from the beginning? I, the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;alpha-and-omegaa-and-zaleph-and-tav&#34;&gt;Alpha and Omega/A and Z/Aleph and Tav&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We typically think of Jesus as saying He is the Alpha and the Omega, but note here, we would say it is &amp;ldquo;God the Father&amp;rdquo; speaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phrase also appears in Rev 21:6 and Rev 22:13.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Hebrew, the first and last letters are Aleph א and Tav ת.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The word אֵת (et) has a unique function in Hebrew. See the callout box if you are interested in learning more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note again that the Father says He &amp;ldquo;is coming.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another one of God&amp;rsquo;s names in the Hebrew Bible is El Shaddai - which is God almighty in the sense of the protector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;The Aleph and the Tav&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word אֵת is most often used as a grammatical marker in the Bible. It is used to indicate a definite direct object. When used this way, it has no direct translational value. It is spelled with Aleph (א) and tav (ת).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional Jewish exegesis (a fancy word for &amp;ldquo;Bible study&amp;rdquo;) sees four layers of meaning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The literal surface meaning – we always start here, and the deeper interpretations must never contradict the base meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is called a &amp;ldquo;hint of something deeper.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A comparative meaning often drawn from the conclusion of similar words/phrases among passages.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 19:18 contain the exact phrase, &amp;ldquo;and you shall love.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus was employing this level of interpretation when He linked these two verses as &amp;ldquo;the greatest commandment&amp;rdquo; – &amp;ldquo;and you shall love the Lord your God…&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;and you shall love your neighbor…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An esoteric mystical meaning (obviously, we use this one with caution).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a &amp;ldquo;hint of something deeper,&amp;rdquo; several verses in Hebrew can take on an added deeper meaning when we consider that Jesus called Himself the &amp;ldquo;Aleph and the Tav.&amp;rdquo; Let&amp;rsquo;s look at just three of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genesis 1:1 – the very first verse in the Bible:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים &lt;strong&gt;אֵת&lt;/strong&gt; הַשָּׁמַיִם &lt;strong&gt;וְאֵת&lt;/strong&gt; הָאָרֶץ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curiously there are also precisely seven Hebrew words. In the beginning (all one word) created God (et) the heaven (et) the earth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could we also say that in the beginning, God, &lt;strong&gt;the Aleph, and Tav&lt;/strong&gt;, created the heavens, and &lt;strong&gt;the Aleph and Tav&lt;/strong&gt; created the world? I believe we could.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genesis 1:4
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;וַיַּ֧רְא אֱלֹהִ֛ים &lt;strong&gt;אֶת&lt;/strong&gt;־הָא֖וֹר כִּי־ט֑וֹב&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And God saw the light, and it was good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And God saw &lt;strong&gt;the Aleph and Tav&lt;/strong&gt;, the Light, and it was good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zechariah 12:10
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;והביטו אלי &lt;strong&gt;את&lt;/strong&gt; אשׁר־דקרו&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They will look upon me whom they have pierced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They will look upon me, &lt;strong&gt;the Aleph and Tav,&lt;/strong&gt; whom they have pierced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Seven &amp;lsquo;LORD, God Almighty&amp;rsquo;&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the literal phrase used in the Old Testament (אֱלֹהֵֽי־צְבָא֖וֹת which sometimes gets translated as &amp;ldquo;God of Hosts&amp;rdquo;, and commonly, but &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; poorly transliterated as &amp;ldquo;Jehovah Sabaoth&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am the &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;Z,&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; says Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, the One who is, who was and who is coming. (Rev 1:8)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each of the four living beings had six wings and was covered with eyes inside and out; and day and night they never stop saying, &amp;ldquo;Holy, holy, holy is Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies the One who was, who is and who is coming!&amp;rdquo; (Rev 4:8)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;saying, &amp;ldquo;We thank you, Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, the One who is and was, that you have taken your power and have begun to rule. (Rev 11:17)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They were singing the song of Moshe, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb: &amp;ldquo;Great and wonderful are the things you have done, Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies! Just and true are your ways, king of the nations! (Rev 15:3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I heard the altar say, &amp;ldquo;Yes, Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, your judgments are true and just!&amp;rdquo; (Rev 16:7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I heard what sounded like the roar of a huge crowd, like the sound of rushing waters, like loud peals of thunder, saying, &amp;ldquo;Halleluyah! Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, has begun his reign! (Rev 19:6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I saw no Temple in the city, for Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, is its Temple, as is the Lamb. (Rev 21:22)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why &amp;ldquo;Adonai&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many of our English Bibles, when translators came across what is called the &amp;ldquo;Tetragrammaton&amp;rdquo; (The Hebrew word for God&amp;rsquo;s name spelled yod-hei-vav-hei), they typically render it as &lt;small&gt;LORD&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, they are preserving a Jewish custom that was in place during the time of Jesus&#39; ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observant Jews will never attempt to pronounce this name. Instead, they will say &amp;ldquo;Adonai&amp;rdquo; if in a formal/religious setting or &amp;ldquo;Hashem,&amp;rdquo; Hebrew for &amp;ldquo;The Name,&amp;rdquo; if in a less formal setting. This purposeful avoidance of using God&amp;rsquo;s sacred Name is called a &amp;ldquo;circumlocution.&amp;rdquo; Jesus used circumlocutions many times and NEVER pronounced the Name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage our students to use a circumlocution such as &amp;ldquo;Lord&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Adonai.&amp;rdquo;. It shows similar honor as not calling your parents by their first name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, &amp;ldquo;Jehovah&amp;rdquo; is a made-up word. Some Hebrew Bibles add the vowels from &amp;ldquo;Adonai&amp;rdquo; to the Tetragrammaton. This is to remind readers to say &amp;ldquo;Adonai.&amp;rdquo; When some non-Hebrew speaker mistakenly tried to pronounce this non-word, he came up with &amp;ldquo;Jehovah.&amp;rdquo; Don&amp;rsquo;t call God &amp;ldquo;Jehovah.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s not a real word!
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever been to a Jewish home, you may have noticed something long and narrow attached to an outer door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/e5d1e7831cd11a6b9ef323c77f8d1a18.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;33%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is called a Mezuzah and it comes from a command in Deu 6:9 You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Referring to the Shema, you shall love the Lord with all your heart, all your soul and all your might.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inside the Mezuzah will be a scroll with the Shema and other passages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the outside of the Mezuzah will be the Hebrew letter Shin, the W looking character you can see on this mezuzah. The shin is short for Shaddai.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Mezuzah serves as a reminder that God almighty is the great protector and in return He asks for our love and obedience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll say this a lot but remember John&amp;rsquo;s original audience was under a death sentence for practicing their faith. They neeed to be reminded of God&amp;rsquo;s almighty-ness and His protection and provision. God&amp;rsquo;s army is WAAAAY more powerful than the Roman army.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I, Yochanan, am a brother of yours and a fellow-sharer in the suffering, kingship, and perseverance that come from being united with Yeshua. I had been exiled to the island called Patmos for having proclaimed the message of God and borne witness to Yeshua.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 10:2-4 In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three weeks. 3 I ate no delicacies, no meat or wine entered my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, for the full three weeks. 4 On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river (that is, the Tigris)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;exiled-to-patmos&#34;&gt;Exiled to Patmos&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/4ba61b20eea37afb7fb8d31162fcbb1a.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John is positioning himself as an equal, not a superior; an empathizer not a sympathizer.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We discussed how John came to be at Patmos during our background lesson.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patmos is a relatively small Greek island (17.5 sq mi) about 35 miles off the coast of Turkey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were two levels of Roman exile&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first was actual deportation (&lt;em&gt;deportatio in insulaim&lt;/em&gt;), in which the prisoner lost all rights; this was permanent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second was what we might call a relegation (&lt;em&gt;relegation ad insulam&lt;/em&gt;), which was a temporary banishment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It appears John fell into the second group. In any case, the Romans did not want the Gospel going out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surrounded by water, it is no surprise that the sea is a dominant image throughout the book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the fifth century, the &amp;ldquo;Cave of the Apocalypse&amp;rdquo; has been venerated to mark the site where John received visitation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Photo credit:&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;proclaimed-the-message-of-god&#34;&gt;Proclaimed the message of God&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This will be a recurring theme as many believers will be martyred for this reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We believe John wasn&amp;rsquo;t directly martyred but died of natural causes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, if we believe the tradition, Domitian ordered John boiled in oil, yet John was spared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Jewish mind would say that John &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; martyred, and then he was delivered by God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;daniel-10-as-parallel-passage&#34;&gt;Daniel 10 as parallel passage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a parallel of Revelation 1:9-20 and Daniel 10, which we will explore next lesson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For now, note the similarities of 1:9 to Daniel 10:2-4.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They both have a &amp;ldquo;double&amp;rdquo; introduction for emphasis (&amp;ldquo;I, John&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;I, Daniel&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both can be said to be physically suffering for God (John externally and Daniel internally through a three-week fast).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both are in exile (John at Patmos, Daniel on the bank of the Tigres in Babylon).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-110-in-the-spirit-on-the-day-of-the-lord&#34;&gt;Rev 1:10: In the Spirit on the Day of the Lord&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;I came to be, in the Spirit, on the Day of the Lord; and I heard behind me a loud voice, like a trumpet&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;i-came-to-be-in-the-spirit&#34;&gt;I came to be in the Spirit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three primary options, each of which is a conjecture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John&amp;rsquo;s received a vision but was not physically transported anywhere, like a dream (and it was not uncommon for people to receive messages from God via dreams)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John had what we might call an &amp;ldquo;out of body experience&amp;rdquo;; his body remained on Patmos, but he was otherwise transported to the heavenly throne&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John was physically present&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2 Corinthians 12:2, Paul says, &amp;ldquo;whether in the body or out of the body, I do not know.&amp;rdquo;  Maybe John himself didn&amp;rsquo;t know either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;day-of-the-lordlords-day&#34;&gt;Day of the Lord/Lord&amp;rsquo;s Day&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was this a weekday or a moment in time? The possibilities discussed below are conjecture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Sunday
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While this is the day we honor the resurrection, there is no biblical evidence that the first day of the week was ever referred to as &amp;ldquo;The Lord&amp;rsquo;s day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Saturday
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Genesis 2, Exodus 16, and Exodus 20, if there is one day of the week that God holds holy, it&amp;rsquo;s Saturday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a direct connection between the Sabbath and the kingdom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, the Bible never refers to Shabbat as &amp;ldquo;the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Day&amp;rdquo; either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This view is further rendered unlikely since John was told to write, a creative activity widely considered prohibited on Shabbat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John was not referencing a specific day of the week, but a particular moment in time: &lt;strong&gt;the fulfillment and restoration of all things.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are NUMEROUS biblical references for the &amp;ldquo;Day of the Lord&amp;rdquo; to support this view: (Is. 2:12; 13:6-9; Ezek. 13:5, 30:3; Joel 1:15; 2:1-31; 3:14; Amos 5:18-20; Obad. 15; Zeph 1:7-14; Zech 14:1; Mal 4:5).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is where I tend to land.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John wasn&amp;rsquo;t telling us the day of the week so much as he told us the moment in time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As Stern comments, for John to note the day of the week would be a minor if not an entirely insignificant detail. For John to say he was present for the final judgment is monumentally significant.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-loud-voice-like-a-trumpet&#34;&gt;A loud voice like a trumpet&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hebrew for loud voice &lt;em&gt;kol gadol –&lt;/em&gt; this is also how the Bible describes thunder or a deafening noise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Daniel 10:6, &amp;ldquo;the sound of his words were like the sound of a multitude.&amp;rdquo; (photo credit&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). John hears the same sound, but it is &amp;ldquo;loud voice, like a trumpet&amp;rdquo; to him.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Greek does not indicate whether the trumpet is a &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt; (a ram&amp;rsquo;s horn made into a trumpet) or a brass trumpet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A brass trumpet would connote a call to battle, while a shofar would connote a call to worship. Either may be applicable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later in chapter 1, John will more clearly describe a &lt;em&gt;menorah&lt;/em&gt;, so precisely, a &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt;, also used in the Jewish Temple service, looks likely here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In any case, when a Jew such as John heard a trumpet, he knew it was a call to assemble and prepare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John wrote the vision down right away not just to remember it but also so it would function as a testimony.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The person receiving an apocalypse was often told to &amp;ldquo;seal up&amp;rdquo; the words. Not so with John. This is to be an &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Seven First and Last?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The KJV adds, &amp;ldquo;I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last&amp;rdquo; before the instruction to write.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This phrase is not contained in the newer translations (NIV, ESV, NLT, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As familiar as the phrase &amp;ldquo;First and Last&amp;rdquo; is, it only occurs three times in Isaiah and then, according to KJV, four times in Revelation for a total of seven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this instance, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t surprise me if the KJV is correct and the other translations were mistaken in omitting &amp;ldquo;I am the first and the last&amp;rdquo; from verse 11.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Isaiah 41:4 Who has performed and done this, calling the generations from the beginning? I, the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah 44:6 Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: “I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah 48:12  “Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel, whom I called! I am he; I am the first, and I am the last.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revelation 1:11&lt;/em&gt; (disputed) Saying, &lt;em&gt;I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and,&lt;/em&gt; What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation 1:17 And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation 2:8 And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation 22:13  I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 12 will begin a very unusual description of Jesus (or perhaps a blurring of the entire Godhead). We will pick this up next time, but there is one crucial point to make. The picture of Jesus in our minds may be quite different from the Jesus of Revelation. We must be conformed to his image and not force God to conform to our image. As we have been saying, we need not cling too tightly to any preconceptions. Revelation may challenge a lot of them. Part of the blessing from reading Revelation comes with our own unveiling; that is, when our biases and bloodspots are exposed and resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One tell-tale sign of this in the Gospels is when people pick up stones to stone Jesus. We may miss what is going on, but in the people&amp;rsquo;s minds, Jesus had just committed blasphemy by equating Himself to God (or as Christians would say, &amp;ldquo;God the Father&amp;rdquo;). The penalty for blasphemy is death by stoning.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

His head and hair were as white as snow-white wool, his eyes like a fiery flame, 15. his feet like burnished brass refined in a furnace, and his voice like the sound of rushing waters. 16. In his right hand he held seven stars, out of his mouth went a sharp double-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in full strength. 17. When I saw him, I fell down at his feet like a dead man. He placed his right hand upon me and said, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid! I am the First and the Last, 18. the Living One. I was dead, but look!—I am alive forever and ever! And I hold the keys to Death and Sh&amp;rsquo;ol. 19. So write down what you see, both what is now, and what will happen afterward. 20. Here is the secret meaning of the seven stars you saw in my right hand, and of the seven gold menorahs: the seven stars are the angels of the seven Messianic communities, and the seven menorahs are the seven Messianic communities.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;daniel-7-and-10&#34;&gt;Daniel 7 and 10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called &amp;ldquo;Vision of the Risen Christ&amp;rdquo; in Revelation 1:12-18 has several similarities (and key differences) with Daniel 7 and Daniel 10. It is beneficial to read the Daniel passages before we begin a verse-by-verse study of the remainder of Revelation 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Daniel passages, focus on the depictions of the &amp;ldquo;Ancient of Days&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Son of Man&amp;rdquo; in Daniel 7:9-14, and then the description of the unnamed angel in Daniel 10:5-10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-2&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;(1) In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head as he lay in his bed. Then he wrote down the dream and told the sum of the matter. (2) Daniel declared, &amp;ldquo;I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea. (3) And four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another. (4) The first was like a lion and had eagles&#39; wings. Then as I looked its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and the mind of a man was given to it. (5) And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side. It had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, &amp;lsquo;Arise, devour much flesh.&amp;rsquo; (6) After this I looked, and behold, another, like a leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back. And the beast had four heads, and dominion was given to it. (7) After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns. (8) I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them &lt;mark&gt;another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(9) &amp;ldquo;As I looked, thrones were placed, and the &lt;mark&gt;Ancient of Days took his seat&lt;/mark&gt;; his &lt;mark&gt;clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool&lt;/mark&gt;; his throne was fiery flames; its wheels were burning fire. (10) A stream of fire issued and came out from before him; a thousand thousands served him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the court sat in judgment, and the books were opened. (11) &amp;ldquo;I looked then because of the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking. And as I looked, the beast was killed, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire. (12) As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time. (13) &amp;ldquo;I saw in the night visions, and behold, &lt;mark&gt;with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man&lt;/mark&gt;, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. (14) And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed. (15) &amp;ldquo;As for me, Daniel, my spirit within me was anxious, and the visions of my head alarmed me. (16) I approached one of those who stood there and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of the things.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(17) &amp;lsquo;These four great beasts are four kings who shall arise out of the earth. (18) But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, forever and ever.&amp;rsquo; (19) &amp;ldquo;Then I desired to know the truth about the fourth beast, which was different from all the rest, exceedingly terrifying, with its teeth of iron and claws of bronze, and which devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet, (20) and about the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn that came up and before which three of them fell, the horn that had eyes and a mouth that spoke great things, and that seemed greater than its companions. (21) As I looked, this horn made war with the saints and prevailed over them, (22) until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High, and the time came when the saints possessed the kingdom. (23) &amp;ldquo;Thus he said: &amp;lsquo;As for the fourth beast, there shall be a fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be different from all the kingdoms, and it shall devour the whole earth, and trample it down, and break it to pieces. (24) As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise, and another shall arise after them; he shall be different from the former ones, and shall put down three kings. (25) He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time. (26) But the court shall sit in judgment, and his dominion shall be taken away, to be consumed and destroyed to the end. (27) And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; his kingdom shall be an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.&amp;rsquo; (28) &amp;ldquo;Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly alarmed me, and my color changed, but I kept the matter in my heart.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One suggestion is that Daniel was alarmed in verse 15 because this was a paradigm shift.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the prevailing view of his day, Messiah was not necessarily a deity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet in verse 13, Daniel sees the Ancient of Days (whom we might call &amp;ldquo;the Father&amp;rdquo;) giving the kingdom, the power, and the glory – where have we heard that phrase before? – to the one like a Son of Man, whom we might identify as Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walton (et al.) notes that Jewish writings from before Jesus viewed the &amp;ldquo;son of man&amp;rdquo; as the Jewish Messiah.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John would have been familiar with these documents, particularly &lt;em&gt;1 Enoch&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, the earliest Christians saw the &amp;ldquo;Son of Man&amp;rdquo; as Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel 10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walton estimates Daniel 7 was 552-549 BCE (Babylonian reign of Belshazzar), and Daniel 10 was 537-536 BCE (Persian reign of Cyrus). He notes Daniel 10 is &amp;ldquo;very close to the time when the first wave of Jews are returning from captivity and beginning the rebuilding of the (second) temple.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Again, note the description of the angelic messenger and Daniel&amp;rsquo;s reaction in verses 5-12 compared with Revelation 1:12-18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;(1) In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a word was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar. And the word was true, and it was a great conflict. And he understood the word and had understanding of the vision. (2) In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three weeks. (3) I ate no delicacies, no meat or wine entered my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, for the full three weeks. (4) On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river (that is, the &lt;mark&gt;Tigris&lt;/mark&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(5) I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, &lt;mark&gt;a man clothed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist. (6) His body was like beryl, his face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; (7) And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great trembling fell upon them, and they fled to hide. (8) So I was left alone and saw this great vision, and no strength was left in me. My radiant appearance was fearfully changed, and I retained no strength. &lt;strong&gt;(9) Then I heard the sound of his words, and as I heard the sound of his words, I fell on my face in deep sleep with my face to the ground. (10) And behold, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees. (11) And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;O Daniel, man greatly loved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for now I have been sent to you.&amp;rdquo; And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up trembling. (12) Then he said to me, &amp;ldquo;Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand and humbled yourself before your God, your words have been heard, and I have come because of your words.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(13) The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days, but Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I was left there with the kings of Persia, (14) and came to make you understand what is to happen to your people in the latter days. For the vision is for days yet to come.&amp;rdquo; (15) When he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground and was mute. (16) And behold, one in the &lt;mark&gt;likeness of the children of man&lt;/mark&gt; touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke. I said to him who stood before me, &amp;ldquo;O my lord, by reason of the vision pains have come upon me, and I retain no strength. (17) How can my lord&amp;rsquo;s servant talk with my lord? For now no strength remains in me, and no breath is left in me.&amp;rdquo; (18) Again one having the appearance of a man touched me and strengthened me. (19) And he said, &amp;ldquo;O man greatly loved, fear not, peace be with you; be strong and of good courage.&amp;rdquo; And as he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, &amp;ldquo;Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.&amp;rdquo; (20) Then he said, &amp;ldquo;Do you know why I have come to you? But now I will return to fight against the prince of Persia; and when I go out, behold, the prince of Greece will come. (21) But I will tell you what is inscribed in the book of truth: there is none who contends by my side against these except Michael, your prince.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12. I turned around to see who was speaking to me; and when I had turned, I saw seven gold menorahs;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Exodus 37:23 And he made its seven lamps and its tongs and its trays of pure gold. Zec 4:2 And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;What do you see?&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember back in verse 10, John heard a great voice behind him. Here he turns to look.
&lt;img src=&#34;images/f37a1158a991a6a4d9acb4a8284cc1ff.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your Bible may say, &amp;ldquo;lampstands or candlesticks,&amp;rdquo; but what John sees is unquestionably a menorah, as Stern translated in the CJB.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He renders as &amp;ldquo;seven menorahs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A menorah has seven branches; this is one Menorah with seven lights. To the right is a photo I took of the Temple Institute Menorah in2013.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later, we will find out that each &amp;ldquo;candlestick&amp;rdquo; is a congregation with Jesus in the midst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Menorah is also reminiscent of a tree or a vine with branches.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus is the vine, and we are the branches (John 15).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus is also the light of the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, the tabernacle/temple menorah was made of gold, which fits with verse 12.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Missler, this scene should remind us of the Tabernacle.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The robe and gold band in verse 13 may allude to the High Priest (Exodus 28:4).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The high priest was the one who tended the Menorah, including snuffing out and correcting if unsatisfactory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lizorkin says, &amp;ldquo;the presence of the Temple menorah would signal to John&amp;rsquo;s audience that his visionary experience took place in the vicinity of the Temple. And more precisely in the inner section of the Temple.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Temple/Tabernacle Menorah also testifies to God&amp;rsquo;s presence.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seven fellowships are supposed to live in such a way that their communities see God&amp;rsquo;s light and presence.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Num 7:89 And when Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with the LORD, he heard the voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim; and it spoke to him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-113-one-like-a-son-of-man&#34;&gt;Rev 1:13: One Like a Son of Man&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Revelation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13. and among the menorahs was someone like a Son of Man, wearing a robe down to his feet and a gold band around his chest&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Exo 28:4 These are the garments that they shall make: a breast piece, an ephod, a robe, a coat of checker work, a turban, and a sash. They shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother and his sons to serve me as priests.  &lt;br&gt;Dan 7:13 &amp;ldquo;I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came &lt;mark&gt;one like a son of man&lt;/mark&gt;, and he came to the &lt;mark&gt;Ancient of Days&lt;/mark&gt; and was presented before him. Dan 10:5 I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, a man clothed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist. &lt;br&gt;Dan 10:16 And behold, &lt;mark&gt;one in the likeness of the children of man&lt;/mark&gt; touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke. I said to him who stood before me, &amp;ldquo;O my lord, by reason of the vision pains have come upon me, and I retain no strength.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is often called the &amp;ldquo;vision of the Risen Christ.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that John noted one dressed as a priest in the &amp;ldquo;midst&amp;rdquo; of the Menorah may suggest he was witnessing Jesus as High Priest in heavenly Tabernacle (Heb 9).
&lt;img src=&#34;images/0fab3a7bee3b9b8d1fbc99ce645b1a4a.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The photo shows the &amp;ldquo;Holy Place,&amp;rdquo; where the Menorah was located. In the foreground is the Table of Showbread. By the curtain leading to the Holy of Holies is the Altar of Incense. (Ex 26:33)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is from a Tabernacle replica that one can visit near Eilat, Israel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, John does NOT identify Jesus but says &amp;ldquo;one like a Son of Man.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John and Jesus were very close during Jesus&#39; earthly ministry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presumably, He would have said, &amp;ldquo;and among the Menorahs was Jesus wearing a robe…&amp;quot;…but he didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We know from 1:1 and 22:8 that John is not talking directly with Jesus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This angelic divine being is at the same time Jesus but not quite Jesus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we saw from some of the parallel passages, the description of the one like a Son of Man is inherited from the Ancient of Days.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Baruch Korman writes, &amp;ldquo;This is a depiction of Messiah taking on the mantle of God the father.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Lizorkin writes, &amp;ldquo;The garments are highly symbolic, showing that Jesus is the heavenly priest, fully prepared and qualified to carry out His duties.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Keener writes, &amp;ldquo;the cumulative impact of these images is to present the risen Jesus as the greatest conceivable figure.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are numerous parallels among Revelation 1:12-18, Daniel 7, Daniel 10, and to a lesser extent, Ezekiel 1 and even Matthew 17 and the Transfiguration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will compare Revelation 1 and Daniel 10 towards the end of the lesson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus physically is seated at the Right Hand of the Father
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This may explain why it appears to be an Angel and not Jesus directly who speaks with John.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus is to remain seated at the Right Hand until the appointed time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In either case, Jesus is also spiritually amid our fellowships and us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember also that the earthly fellowships were undergoing intense persecution. Perhaps they felt abandoned by God, but here we see God is right in their midst.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Eze 1:&lt;strong&gt;7, 24&lt;/strong&gt; Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf&amp;rsquo;s foot. And they sparkled like burnished bronze. &lt;strong&gt;24&lt;/strong&gt; And when they went, I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of many waters, like the sound of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of an army. When they stood still, they let down their wings. &lt;strong&gt;Eze 43:2&lt;/strong&gt; And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east. And the sound of his coming was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone with his glory.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;16. In his right hand he held seven stars, out of his mouth went a sharp double-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in full strength.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jdg 5:31 &amp;ldquo;So may all your enemies perish, O LORD! But your friends be like the sun as he rises in his might.&amp;rdquo; Isa 49:2 He made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand he hid me; he made me a polished arrow; in his quiver he hid me away. Heb 4:12 For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We occasionally see drawings, some quite grotesque in my opinion, of Jesus with a literal sword coming out of His mouth. This misses the point entirely. Obviously, the sword is symbolic. As Lizorkin says, &amp;ldquo;this being is powerful enough to destroy with his voice alone.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early Jewish believers saw the two edges as two aspects of the Word of God
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either the &amp;ldquo;law and the prophets&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Moses and Jesus.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, Reformation theology sees &amp;ldquo;Law&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Gospel&amp;rdquo; as opposites. They are not. The opposite of &amp;ldquo;law&amp;rdquo; is not &amp;ldquo;grace&amp;rdquo; but &amp;ldquo;lawlessness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If this is the model, here we see that Law and Gospel are not opposed to each other but are two sides of the same sword&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both bring judgment for the wicked and life for the righteous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Baruch pointed out that a sword also divides and separates, in the sense that in Genesis 1:4, God divided the light from the darkness.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I saw a meme recently that the light never flees in the face of darkness. It is the darkness that runs when confronted by light. For darkness to prevail, the light source must be removed. John 3:19 has more about this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Dan 8:17-18 So he came near where I stood. And when he came, I was frightened and fell on my face. But he said to me, &amp;ldquo;Understand, O son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end.&amp;rdquo; 18 And when he had spoken to me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground. But he touched me and made me stand up.  Dan 10:9-10,12,15 followed by Dan 10:19 And he said, &amp;ldquo;O man greatly loved, fear not, peace be with you; be strong and of good courage.&amp;rdquo; And as he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, &amp;ldquo;Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a common reaction when people in the Bible are given a glimpse of God – even if it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; an angel, they are terrified!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The drawing on the right illustrates Abraham bowing before angelic visitors, one of whom is the &amp;ldquo;Angel of the Lord.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of our Bibles have from 1:17 through the end of chapter 3 in red text; the translators assume Jesus is speaking. It&amp;rsquo;s a fair assumption; however, if we&amp;rsquo;re faithful to the text, John does not record who is speaking.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 1:1 and Rev 22:8 tell us John received the vision from an Angel, not from Jesus directly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuming this is John the Apostle, he knew Jesus better than anyone. Was he afraid because this incredible and terrifying being wasn&amp;rsquo;t Jesus?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if we assume it was Jesus, there is a lesson.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No matter how well you know Jesus, He&amp;rsquo;s still God. We can&amp;rsquo;t get too casual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CS Lewis captures this beautifully in &amp;ldquo;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.&amp;rdquo; Susan Pevensie is talking to Mr. Beaver. &amp;ldquo;Aslan is a lion- the Lion, the great Lion.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Ooh,&amp;rdquo; said Susan. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d thought he was a man. Is he-quite safe? I shall feel rather nervous about meeting a lion&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Safe&lt;/strong&gt;?&amp;rdquo; said Mr. Beaver &lt;strong&gt;&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;Who said anything about safe? &amp;lsquo;Course he isn&amp;rsquo;t safe&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;But he&amp;rsquo;s good&lt;/strong&gt;. He&amp;rsquo;s the King, I tell you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In any case, the angel has the authority to speak for Jesus and God the Father in the 1st person.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we look back in Genesis, the &amp;ldquo;Angel of the LORD&amp;rdquo; in the Old Testament has the authority to speak for the Father in the first person. It&amp;rsquo;s as if Abraham is communicating with God Himself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe that is the case with John. The text tells us John is not speaking with Jesus directly, but he might as well be since He&amp;rsquo;s the only One who purchased our life with His death&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The safest avenue is to say John is speaking with an Angel of the God of Israel, acknowledging some elasticity in our definitions of the Father, Spirit, and Son.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-118-i-was-dead-but-behold-i-am-alive&#34;&gt;Rev 1:18: &amp;ldquo;I was dead but behold, I Am alive!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Isa 25:8 He will swallow up death forever; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from all faces, and the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for the LORD has spoken.  Hos 13:14 I shall ransom them from the power of Sheol; I shall redeem them from death. O death, where are your plagues? O Sheol, where is your sting?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1 Corinthians 15:54, Paul says, &amp;ldquo;the saying will come about as it is written, &amp;ldquo;Death is swallowed up in victory!&amp;rdquo; He was quoting Isaiah 25:8. The words spoken to John appear linked to this passage also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the great find of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1948 in a cave by the Dead Sea: a complete and relatively intact scroll containing the book of Isaiah. Before this, the most recent full copy of the Hebrew Bible we had was from the 9th or 10th century CE. This scroll dates to 1000 years prior, the 1st Century before Christ, or before the Common Era. There are minor differences only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Conservative scholars tend to see this as an Outline of the book, though this is debated:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you see: the Vision of the Risen Christ – chapter 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The things which are: the seven assemblies/churches - chapters 2-3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The things that shall be after – chapters 4-22&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Greek phrase for &amp;ldquo;after these things&amp;rdquo; is μετα ταυτα meta tauta.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meta tauta acts as a signpost throughout Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Rev 1:19 Write therefore the things that you have seen, those that are and those that are to take place &lt;mark&gt;after this&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 4:1 &lt;mark&gt;After this&lt;/mark&gt; I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 4:1 And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place &lt;mark&gt;after this&lt;/mark&gt;.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 7:1 &lt;mark&gt;after this&lt;/mark&gt; I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, that no wind might blow on earth or sea or against any tree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 7:9 &lt;mark&gt;after this&lt;/mark&gt; I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 9:12 The first woe has passed; behold, two woes are &lt;mark&gt;still to come&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 15:5 &lt;mark&gt;after this&lt;/mark&gt; I looked, and the sanctuary of the tent of witness in heaven was opened&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 18:1 &lt;mark&gt;after this&lt;/mark&gt; I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was made bright with his glory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 19:1 &lt;mark&gt;after this&lt;/mark&gt; I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, crying out, “Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 20:3 and threw him (Satan) into the pit, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he might not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were ended. &lt;mark&gt;After that&lt;/mark&gt; he must be released for a little while.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Tens in the Bible&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are not seven but 10 μετα ταυτα phrases in Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Hebrew Gematria, specific numbers that reappear throughout the Bible are assigned concepts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gematria means that scholars, both ancient sages and modern academics, have studied these patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where they see seven, they notice a general theme of completion or perfection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using this method, 10 represents divine order or law,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most obvious examples are the 10 commandments and the 10 plagues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were also 10 generations from Adam to Noah, where we saw the flood restoring order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were also 10 generations from Noah to Abraham where we received the Abrahamic covenant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Ruth 4, there is a strange prophecy given to Ruth and Boaz, followed by a list of 10 generations from Perez to King David.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ruth 4:12 and may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring that the LORD will give you by this young woman.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you know the story of Tamar and Judah, it&amp;rsquo;s sordid. If you received this &amp;ldquo;blessing,&amp;rdquo; you might be inclined to think &amp;ldquo;same to you, fella!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perez was the product of a &amp;ldquo;forbidden union&amp;rdquo; between Tamar and Judah, her father in-law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deuteronomy 23:2 - &amp;ldquo;No one born of a forbidden union may enter the assembly of the LORD. Even to the &lt;em&gt;tenth&lt;/em&gt; generation, none of his descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The backstory is Tamar&amp;rsquo;s previous husbands (Judah&amp;rsquo;s other sons) had died without issue, and it was Judah&amp;rsquo;s responsibility to see that his line continued.  He failed to do this, so Tamar posed as a prostitute and went into to Judah.  Of course, she became pregnant by him.  When Judah found out that his daughter in law had played the harlot, he was furious.  He was about to have her executed when she presented evidence that he was the father of the child.  Oops.  The son&amp;rsquo;s name was Perez.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The end of Ruth connects the dots for us by listing 10 generations from Perez to David the King.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a spiritual perspective, this was yet another attempt by Satan to sabotage the lineage of Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tamar perhaps unknowingly, saw to it that the line continued, and indeed she is one of the four women noted in Jesus&#39; genealogy (Matthew 1:3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-120-the-meaning-of-the-starsmenorah&#34;&gt;Rev 1:20: The Meaning of the Stars/Menorah&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;20. Here is the secret meaning of the seven stars you saw in my right hand, and of the seven gold menorahs: the seven stars are the angels of the seven Messianic communities, and the seven menorahs are the seven Messianic communities.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Zech 4: 2 And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;What do you see?&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/06d103558029ba8fd995cd8e7e4bea39.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A topic of debate is whether the seven stars/angels are natural or supernatural&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About all the &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; camp has going for it is our western minds can understand it better.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this view, the angels of each congregation are human.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More than likely, the messenger would be the pastor of each community or a designated reader in the synagogue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, no church leadership position is ever called an angel or messenger anywhere else in the New Testament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In favor of the supernatural angel view, the entire book of Revelation has angels everywhere, so why not in Chapters 2 and 3?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewish texts often portray angels as stars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this view, churches/fellowships have designated angels just like nations do.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Daniel 10, the angelic messenger had to do battle with the spirit of Persia and then had to go back to do battle with the spirit of Greece.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, there is a heavenly counterpart to an earthly reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Admittedly it is foreign to think of a fellowship having a &amp;ldquo;guardian angel.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If our churches had such an angel, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it keep false teaching and division out of the church?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protestants tend to deemphasize angels, which is odd given that &amp;ldquo;angels&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;angel&amp;rdquo; appears over 180 times in the New Testament- about 80 times in Revelation and the other 100 in the rest of the New Testament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is probably much more going on in the supernatural angelic community than most of us realize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In both Hebrew and Greek, the meaning could be either a supernatural angel or a natural messenger. However, only about six times out of the 180 can we be certain that the word references only a human messenger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This certainly raises several questions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do churches today have designated angels?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was this a 1st-century phenomenon?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was it ONLY these seven specially designated congregations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who knows!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By having the stars in his right hand, the hand of power, John is possibly communicating, &amp;ldquo;Christ is Lord over the universe including Lord over the angels who guide the churches as well as the nations.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keener also notes given the tensions between non-messianic and messianic branches of Judaism in that day, &amp;ldquo;by identifying the churches as (a menorah), John claims that the Jesus movement is the true form of Judaism.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One thing we do know: a menorah&amp;rsquo;s purpose is to give off light in a dark place
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is what our churches should be doing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is what we as disciples should be doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a postscript, let&amp;rsquo;s do a quick side-by-side of Revelation 1 and Daniel 10. In this way, we can see how the book we hold in our laps or in our smart devices is ONE book with one consistent message from beginning to end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;State of preparation&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The being&amp;rsquo;s clothing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5 clothed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13 clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash around his chest.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Head/face&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6 his face like the appearance of lightning, (Dan 7:9 the hair of his head like pure wool)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14 The hairs of his head were white, like white wool, like snow.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Eyes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6 his eyes like flaming torches&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14 His eyes were like a flame of fire,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Arms &amp;amp; Legs/Feet&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6 his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15 his feet were like burnished bronze, refined in a furnace,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Voice&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6 the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15 and his voice was like the roar of many waters.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Reaction&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt; as I heard the sound of his words, I fell on my face in deep sleep with my face to the ground.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17 When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Commission&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; And behold, a hand touched me&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17 But he laid his right hand on me,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Assurance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt; Then he said to me, &amp;ldquo;Fear not, Daniel,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17 saying, &amp;ldquo;Fear not, I am the first and the last, 18 and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lesson will discuss the structure of each of the Seven Letters.  We will also review several approaches to application including three conjectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our fifth lesson in Revelations backgrounds will introduce the seven letters in chapters 2-3. Each letter follows an intricate and nearly identical outline. Understanding this at the outset will help us as we seek to unpack each letter. Next, we will look at several application layers and the commonly taught &amp;ldquo;church age&amp;rdquo; conjecture. We will also look at the often confusing and misunderstood phrases, &amp;ldquo;the Nicolaitans,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;those who say they are Jews but are not,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the synagogue of Satan.&amp;rdquo; Since these phrases occur in multiple letters, we will deal with them upfront. Ultimately Scripture does not define these. We will strive to leverage what we ARE told from Scripture &amp;ndash; and we do get some clues &amp;ndash; with what was going on in that society at the time to make an educated guess that may be different from what is commonly taught. Acts 17:11 says, don&amp;rsquo;t take my word for it but test these theories to see whether these things could be so. As we mentioned in an earlier lesson, our job is not to tell you WHAT to think. It&amp;rsquo;s to get you TO think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-sevenfold-structure-of-each-letter&#34;&gt;The Sevenfold Structure of Each Letter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will find that the letters follow a sequence of seven elements. 1. Name of the city (addressee), 2. An attribute of the Glorified Messiah from 1:12-20 (addresser), 3. Praise that usually begins with &amp;ldquo;I know…&amp;rdquo;, 4. Judgment, 5. Encouragement, 6. A promise to the overcomer, 7. &amp;ldquo;He who has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener notes: &amp;ldquo;Some scholars have compared the elements of the form to Old Testament and ancient Near Eastern covenant formulas; if they are correct, the prophecies here may act like the covenant lawsuits common in the Old Testament prophets (e.g., in Amos 2–4). They may also function analogously to a series of oracles against the nations common in the Old Testament prophets (e.g., Isaiah 13–23; Jer 46–51; Ezek 25–32; especially the eight brief oracles of Amos 1–2).&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We examine each element in greater detail and describe more about the judgment aspect, as commentators often overlook this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-name-of-the-city&#34;&gt;1. Name of the City&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; (1) &amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Ephesus, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message…&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first element is always addressed to the angel of the assembly at each of the cities. We&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in previous lessons that there is scholarly debate as to whether the angel is supernatural or is a human messenger. For our purposes, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter as the body of each letter deals with the behaviors of the human body of believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning of the city&amp;rsquo;s name often is revealing. For example, Ephesus means &amp;ldquo;darling&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;darling one,&amp;rdquo; yet this is the church that lost its first love, and the Greek word used is Agape, a completely devoted type of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we go through each city in subsequent Revelation Background lessons, we will present some of the background history, enhancing our understanding of what God communicates to the fellowship. Keener writes, &amp;ldquo;Ancient cities were fiercely proud of their own history and culture and would be more sensitive to local allusions than most readers today would be.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-a-specific-attribute-of-messiah&#34;&gt;2. A specific attribute of Messiah&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven gold menorahs: &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second element is a specific attribute of the one who is sending the letter. The speaker is never identified as Jesus, but we&amp;rsquo;ll say it&amp;rsquo;s Jesus the Messiah in his risen and glorified form even though we know John received the revelation through an angel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attributes typically tie back to the description of this heavenly being in Revelation 1:12-20. There is one slight deviation in the letter to Philadelphia where He says He has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens. Revelation 1:18 mentions the Keys to death and hades but not the Key of David. Any deviations should get our attention. We&amp;rsquo;ll unpack this when we get to Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-specific-praise-that-begins-with-i-know&#34;&gt;3. Specific Praise that begins with &amp;ldquo;I know….&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; (2) &amp;ldquo;I know what you have been doing, how hard you have worked, how you have persevered, and how you can&amp;rsquo;t stand wicked people; so you tested those who call themselves emissaries but aren&amp;rsquo;t—and you found them to be liars. (3) You are persevering, and you have suffered for my sake without growing weary. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third attribute in each letter is praise. If I read this like an audit report from my corporate auditing days, this would be an attribute that was tested and found to have met the standard. It is something Jesus approves of and encourages us to keep on doing. In some letters, it is apparent that something they think is wrong, Jesus believes is good. To Smyrna, Jesus writes, &amp;ldquo;I know your poverty, but you are rich.&amp;rdquo; They likely did not see themselves as rich, but Jesus says they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every letter follows this sevenfold structure, and it will get our attention when there are deviations. Two letters are conspicuous because they have no praise. These are the 5th and 7th letters: Sardis and Laodicea. Something is seriously wrong with these churches. We&amp;rsquo;ll find out what those things are when we get to those cities. We also note that the &amp;ldquo;I know&amp;rdquo; beginning now precedes the judgment for these two assemblies.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-judgment&#34;&gt;4. Judgment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; (4) But I have this against you: you have lost the love you had at first. (5) Therefore, remember where you were before you fell, turn from this sin, and do what you used to do before. Otherwise, I will come to you and remove your menorah from its place—if you don&amp;rsquo;t turn from your sin! &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth element of Jesus&amp;rsquo; report card is what we might benignly call an improvement opportunity, although we must note Jesus uses much harsher words. This is God pronouncing a judgment. In the example of Ephesus, their deficiency, loss of the love they had at first, is nothing less than a sin which they must repent of at the expense of losing their light. And since Jesus is in the midst of that light, He&amp;rsquo;s saying he&amp;rsquo;s going to remove Ephesus from his midst. That&amp;rsquo;s serious. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a C on the report card; it&amp;rsquo;s not even an F. It&amp;rsquo;s a zero. It&amp;rsquo;s so severe that many commentators believe a loss of salvation is in view for people who don&amp;rsquo;t repent (or we could say people who don&amp;rsquo;t repent even after Jesus tells them to do not show evidence of saving faith).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are very analogous to the judgment pronouncements in the Old Testament. One of the more familiar of these is Jonah. Jonah was called to go to Nineveh, the hated and brutal regime of the day, and pronounce a judgment. He didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go, which was a whale of a tale. Ba-dum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message Jonah was to deliver was that the all-knowing, all-powerful God of Israel knows what wickedness has been occurring in Ninevah, and His patience is not infinite. Judgment is coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judgments like these usually have an expressed or implied safety valve. If the recipient repents, the Judgment will be withheld. We see that in this letter to Ephesus. &amp;ldquo;Remember where you were, repent, and do what you used to do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonah didn&amp;rsquo;t even get to this part of his oracle to Nineveh. The town&amp;rsquo;s leaders understood that repenting was the only way to avert disaster. Which they did, causing Jonah to pout some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who teach that the God of the Old Testament is vengeful and judgmental while the God of the New is all about grace have apparently never read Revelation 2 and 3. They probably have not read much of the Old Testament either. We see God&amp;rsquo;s grace and mercy at the very beginning in the Garden of Eden. God is most gracious, most merciful, and cannot tolerate sin. All are true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as two churches had no praise, two other churches, Smyrna and Philadelphia, have no deficiency. This is one reason everyone wants to think they are part of the church of Philadelphia (but remember, the difference between how we see ourselves and how Jesus sees us is a significant theme throughout each letter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of personal application, if any of Jesus&amp;rsquo; words of judgment to the seven assemblies pinch us a little, we need to repent and get that corrected. As a talmid, I must serve at His pleasure faithfully. If He tells me I need to improve, I know I better improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-encouragement&#34;&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Encouragement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; (6) But you have this in your favor: you hate what the Nicolaitans do—I hate it too. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5th element is encouragement, or, we might say, additional (or secondary) praise. Jesus will follow up his condemnation with a note of encouragement. In some cases, the secondary encouragement is directed to a specific subset of the congregation where perhaps only a few are doing the thing Jesus approves of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We mentioned Sardis and Laodicea do not have any praise. Sardis still has an encouragement that is extremely limited in its scope. For Laodicea, the encouragement takes a different form of a plea, which we&amp;rsquo;ll get to down the road. Pergamum has praise, but they get no secondary encouragement statement. Again, exceptions to the usual pattern need to get our attention. Something is very wrong at Pergamum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the general rule is a 2:1 ratio of praise and encouragement to deficiencies. If your job involves supervising others, auditing, or parenting, this is great to remember. It indicates the deliverer of the bad news cares about the recipients and is not just being a disciplinarian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-promise-to-the-overcomer&#34;&gt;6. Promise to the Overcomer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; To him winning the victory I will give the right to eat from the Tree of Life which is in God&amp;rsquo;s Gan-`Eden.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many translations have &amp;ldquo;to the overcomer.&amp;rdquo; Stern borrows from Paul and phrases it, &amp;ldquo;to him winning the victory.&amp;rdquo; The book of Revelation is about being an overcomer. The entire Christian walk of discipleship (the &amp;ldquo;talmidim way&amp;rdquo;) is about being an overcomer. Romans 12:2 says, &amp;quot; Do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does raise some interesting theological questions. Most commentators assume the letters are addressed to believers. If so, is Jesus saying that there will be some believers who will NOT be overcomers? If so, in Ephesus&#39; case, does that mean there will be believers who do not eat from the Tree of Life?&amp;rdquo; Other commentators see this promise as a forfeit of rewards, not salvation. The counterargument is that eating the tree of life appears to be the only way to avoid the second death. How can one say that one is saved if one can&amp;rsquo;t eat the Tree of Life and avoid the second death? Dr. Fruchtenbaum has what may be a more straightforward rationale. Many assume these letters are written to believers only. Fruchtenbaum points out that these 1st-century fellowships probably had unbelievers alongside believers, just like today&amp;rsquo;s congregations. This may have included some intentional imposters that slipped in as well as people who sincerely believe they are saved, but to whom Jesus will say, &amp;ldquo;depart from me. I never knew you.&amp;rdquo; The overcomers would be those who are genuinely saved, and the non-overcomers would be unsaved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entire debate is easily solved by putting our trust in Jesus. He said, &amp;ldquo;if you love Me, keep my commands.&amp;rdquo; One of His commands is to abide in Him. If we abide in Him and help others do the same, then whether the manmade doctrine of eternal security is true is ultimately relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;7-he-who-has-an-ear&#34;&gt;7. He who has an ear&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;(7) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the Messianic communities.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last component is every letter will have this identical phrase &amp;ldquo;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies or churches&amp;rdquo; This is an exciting statement. Each letter begins directed to a specific congregation, but each ends with an individual application (you and I have ears to hear) and application to all churches. He didn&amp;rsquo;t say here what the spirit is saying to &amp;ldquo;Ephesus&amp;rdquo;; he said Hear what the spirit is saying to the communities. OR your bible probably has &amp;ldquo;what the Spirit says to the churches&amp;rdquo; plural. We&amp;rsquo;ll talk more about the application in the next section. This is a warning for all believers to hear and obey Jesus&#39; words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have 6 and 7 flipped intentionally because the promise comes first in the last four letters, and the letter closes with &amp;ldquo;he who has an ear.&amp;rdquo; The first three are like Ephesus; he who has an ear is followed by the promise. We aren&amp;rsquo;t told from the text why this is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of my professional career first auditing then running audit and monitoring programs. These letters read very much like an audit report - you have the &amp;ldquo;to&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;from,&amp;rdquo; and as auditors, we always give our credentials. Credentials are what makes us an expert in the field. Jesus is giving his judgment credentials. We then present those items that met the standard and those deficiencies that require remediation or corrective action (deficiencies noted were judgments of sorts). Those would be sections 3, 4, and 5of each letter. Then there is always a section on the next steps - we&amp;rsquo;ll recommend to the board that you&amp;rsquo;re good to go for another three years, or maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll recommend to operations that if they can&amp;rsquo;t fix the problem, they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be in the business. I see that as roughly equivalent to the promise to the overcomer. (I never said, &amp;ldquo;if you have eyes to see, you must read my report,&amp;rdquo; but I wish I could have).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;application&#34;&gt;Application&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four surface layers of application and another three within the realm of conjecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four obvious levels are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal (he that has an ear…)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The specific local assembly and its attendees (to the assembly at Ephesus)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All seven assemblies and their attendees (hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All congregations throughout history (hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 21st century, the personal application is the most important. We must resist the temptation to say that each judgment is only for that 1st-century church or some other church I’m not attending. We must make it personal. Let&amp;rsquo;s do some introspective digging. What areas might we need to improve or even repent of in our lives to align them with Jesus&#39; expectations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe the fourth application is valid because there appear to be components in some of the letters that go beyond the local situation and, in some cases, do not appear to apply to the local situation at all. We will highlight these as we get to the specifics of each letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three additional parallels certain scholars have noted. Some connections can be strained in places but, in general, may have value and hint at supernatural design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pauline letter counterpart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matthew 13 parable counterpart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Church Age theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pauline-letter-counterpart&#34;&gt;Pauline letter counterpart&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul also wrote to seven cities (Rome, Corinth, Galatia, Ephesus, Philippi, Colossae, Thessaloniki). The themes in Paul&amp;rsquo;s letters seem to parallel the Seven Letters of Revelation broadly.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later we will look at a passage from Ephesians that appears to fit what we know about Ephesus and applies to the local situation. Ephesus and Laodicea are mentioned explicitly in Ephesians and Colossians, respectively, so those two are natural parings with Jesus&#39; letters to Ephesus and Laodicea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also see that Philippians share some themes with Smyrna&amp;rsquo;s letter regarding suffering. Pergamum talks about a carnal church that&amp;rsquo;s married to the world. Is there a city Paul wrote to that struggled with this? Yep. Corinth. Scholars see connections with Thyatira and Sardis to Galatians and Romans. In some cases, these two can be reversed. Linking Sardis to Romans draws on the Church Age theory discussed below. Philadelphia is the church where everything is going well. Is there a church Paul wrote to where the bulk of the letter is praise and encouragement? That would be Thessalonians. Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s interesting even if they aren&amp;rsquo;t perfect fits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ephesus - Ephesians 4:17-32 parallels Jesus&#39; words to Ephesus - Eph 4:14  so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smyrna - Philippians - Joy through suffering - Php 1:29  For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake / Php 4:4  Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pergamum - Corinthians - Married to the world - 1Co 5:1  It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thyatira - Galatians - Religious externalism themes - Gal 1:6  I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sardis - Romans - Don&amp;rsquo;t know they are dead / don&amp;rsquo;t walk the talk - Rom 3:10-12  as it is written: “None is righteous, no, not one;  (11)  no one understands; no one seeks for God.  (12)  All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Philadelphia - Thessalonians - praiseworthy fellowships - 1Th 2:19  For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laodicea - Colossians - Lukewarm/told to exchange letters - Col 3:2  Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;matthew-13-parable-counterpart&#34;&gt;Matthew 13 Parable counterpart&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the parables, it’s the same general thought. Thyatira deals with a woman Jezebel. Is there a woman featured in one of the parables? Yes - it&amp;rsquo;s the woman with the leaven, a type of sin. To Laodicea, Jesus says he will &amp;ldquo;spew&amp;rdquo; them out of his mouth. Is there a parable that deals with rejecting and casting out? That would be the parable of the Dragnet where the good fish are kept, and the rotten fish are cast away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the Pauline letter counterparts, some connections may be strained. If nothing else, doing Acts 17:11 diligence will cause us to look into Paul&amp;rsquo;s letters and Matthew&amp;rsquo;s parables to see whether these things be so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ephesians - Four soils - identify believers from unbelievers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smyrna - Tares and the wheat - Suffering by the children of the wicked one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pergamum - Mustard Seed - Becomes something it was never intended to be; the birds of the air (ministers of Satan) can nest inside&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thyatira - Woman with Leaven - Only letter/parable that mentions a woman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sardis - Treasure in the field - a few in Sardis will have treasure in heaven&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Philadelphia - Pearl of Great Price - A pearl is an item of adornment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laodicea - Dragnet - spew/cast out the unwanted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;church-age-theory&#34;&gt;Church Age Theory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some scholars make a big deal about the church age theory, but it&amp;rsquo;s not without issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outset, the most common version of the theory holds that all types of churches were always present and, for the most part, are present today. The church assigned to the age happens to be the dominant or at least the predominant church of that given period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ephesus - Apostolic - 70-170&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smyrna - Persecuted - 170 -312&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pergamum - Compromised/Licentious (married to the world) - 312 - 606
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What Satan couldn&amp;rsquo;t destroy by persecution, he tried to kill by erosion from within&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christianity became the state religion under Constantine II - went from pacifist to conquering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byzantine period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thyatira - Papal (Catholic) Church - 606- Present
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boniface II first universal Pope in 606&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tolerate Jezebel - pagan/non-biblical practices infiltrate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medieval period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sardis - Protestant Church - 1517-Present
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NAME (deNOMination) that they are alive but are dead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reformation/Enlightenment period (95 Theses 1517)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Philadelphia - Missionary/Faithful - 1750-Present
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A time when doors were open to the spread of the Gospel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, it corresponds to freedom movements in America, France, and elsewhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It tends to be &amp;ldquo;The church I am attending&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laodicea - Comfortable/Lukewarm - 1900-Present
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short sermons and comfy chairs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sincerely half-hearted believers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conforms to society&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It tends to be &amp;ldquo;The church someone I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with is attending&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we can say that all churches were always present. We know for a fact that Laodicea was present in the apostolic age; Jesus said so! Also, today, which would be the Laodicean age, many Christians worldwide are persecuted the way Smyrna was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unquestionably, this interpretation would not have occurred to John or the original audience, so we need to tread lightly. One issue is it is only limited to the western/European church (to be precise, the churches founded in lands occupied by the western part of the Roman empire and its successors). The eastern faith traditions are not present, many of which are very different from ours. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to find a slot for the Egyptian Coptics, Armenian Orthodox, or African variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the theory applied today results in a bit of &amp;ldquo;us and them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every believer sees him or herself as part of the church of Philadelphia (the missionary and faithful church) and anyone they disagree with as part of the church of Laodicea (the apostate church).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the themes of the letters is how we see ourselves and how Jesus sees us are not necessarily aligned - so many who think they are Philadelphia may not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if every church today is either Laodicea or Philadelphia, we would have only needed two churches in Revelation, not seven. We&amp;rsquo;ll touch on this but hold to it lightly as we go through each city. It&amp;rsquo;s much more vital that we look ourselves in the mirror as we read each letter than categorize different churches according to the Church Age Theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(1) &amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Ephesus, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven gold menorahs: (2) &amp;ldquo;I know what you have been doing, how hard you have worked, how you have persevered, and how you can&amp;rsquo;t stand wicked people; so you tested those who call themselves emissaries but aren&amp;rsquo;t—and you found them to be liars. (3) You are persevering, and you have suffered for my sake without growing weary. (4) But I have this against you: you have lost the love you had at first. (5) Therefore, remember where you were before you fell, turn from this sin, and do what you used to do before. Otherwise, I will come to you and remove your menorah from its place—if you don&amp;rsquo;t turn from your sin! (6) But you have this in your favor: you hate what the Nicolaitans do—I hate it too. (7) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities. To him winning the victory I will give the right to eat from the Tree of Life which is in God&amp;rsquo;s Gan-`Eden.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ephesus was known as the &amp;ldquo;Queen of Asia&amp;rdquo; for its wealth and beauty. Its location meant it could serve as an essential waypoint from Rome to the eastern provinces, either by sea or land. A network of Roman roads connected the seven messianic assemblies. They also eventually linked up with routes leading to Asia proper, including Israel, the Fertile Crescent, and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/e2148e2e2d165d8bdab7dd37acbd2df6.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
During the Roman Empire, Ephesus was a significant harbor village. On the map inset, you can see estimations of the shoreline from 500 BCE to 60 CE to the present. The change was caused by dramatic silting from the Cayster River, making the modern harbor useless. The photo below the map shows the swampy area of the Roman port today.
&lt;img src=&#34;images/b212f4d346b26eab22e6d7c8d72b8189.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photograph shows the Great Theater (with seating up to 25,000) with the street that led to the now silted harbor. Acts 19:21-41 describes a riot that occurred when devotees of Diana/Artemis said that Paul posed a clear and present danger to their way of life. The theater is where the riot took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The harbor street (shown in the center of the picture) would have been lined with shops on both sides.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There was also a large &amp;ldquo;agora,&amp;rdquo; or marketplace adjacent. &amp;ldquo;This would have been the likeliest place…for Aquila, Priscilla, and Paul to have set up shop for their long stay in Ephesus.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; DeSilva also notes the market &amp;ldquo;was a major note in the flow of goods from the East to Rome. Many of the cargoes listed in Rev 18:12-13 could be found arriving in Ephesus from the East for further transportation west.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We need to imagine how difficult it would have been to live life as a set-apart believer in a thoroughly pagan environment like Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars believe Hittites founded Ephesus in 1400 BCE. Archeologists have excavated remains of an early temple to a mother goddess, a Hittite fertility deity that later morphed into Diana/Artemis. If the name &amp;ldquo;Hittite&amp;rdquo; rings a bell, Uriah, one of David&amp;rsquo;s mighty men, was a Hittite. Uriah had a beautiful wife named Bathsheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ephesus repeatedly picked the wrong side in the Peloponnesian, Persian, and Roman wars. Still, it became a favored city under Rome and competed with Pergamum (and Smyrna to a lesser extent) over which city was most favored by Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;ephesus-and-artemis&#34;&gt;Ephesus and Artemis&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/29cb53aa62f9eec4e1ef5e2b61e9994d.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temple to Artemis/Diana was one of the famous &amp;ldquo;Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.&amp;rdquo; With a footprint of 220&#39; x 425&#39;, It is four times larger than the Parthenon in Athens&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It was first built in the mid-6th century BCE atop previous temples dating to the 8th century (the time of King Hezekiah in Judah). Artemis, called Diana by the Romans, was the virgin goddess of the moon, fertility, and nature. Our &amp;ldquo;mother nature&amp;rdquo; myth likely comes from her. Artemis is the earth goddess, nurturing and fertile. As we can see in the photo,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Artemis is depicted as multi-breasted (or multiple eggs, also a symbol of fertility). She can also be cruel, vindictive, and destructive.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the map above, we can see that the temple was situated about a mile outside the central Roman city. Bolen writes, &amp;quot; This makes sense, given Artemis’s identity as a goddess of the wilds.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Fertility rites involving temple prostitutes were shared, which Paul disrupted in the New Testament period. It appears to have been destroyed around 400 CE. Today not much remains of the site except for a conspicuous pillar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/a7ce2c2fc59b27e13b282f7ef52ee27a.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
This coin[^9] from AD 50 shows how much the city identified with Diana, down to its very economy. This is why the townspeople saw Paul not only as a religious threat but also as an economic one. The reverse shows the cult statue of Diana (Artemis) of Ephesus and identifies it as “Diana of Ephesus” (DIANA EPHESIA). It is believed that this coin was struck at the Ephesus mint around AD 50–51. In addition to the temple to Artemis, there were numerous other temples, including a large structure devoted to the worship of Domitian. We&#39;ve mentioned the persecutions against Christians and Jews, but Domitian was also paranoid that fellow Romans conspired against him. He arrested and terrorized anyone he suspected. As a post-script, Domitian was so hated that upon his death, the citizens of Ephesus tore down the statue of him and scratched his name from inscriptions. 
&lt;p&gt;The population of Ephesus during the New Testament period was believed to have been around 200,000, making Ephesus the fifth largest city in the Roman empire. There was an extensive library there, and the city was known as a center for studying arts and magic. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Of note, there was also an infamous and large brothel in Ephesus.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; All of this possibly gives rise to Paul&amp;rsquo;s comment in Ephesians 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Eph 2:1-3 And you were dead in the trespasses and sins (2) in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience— (3) among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the New Testament period, Ephesus and Miletus rivaled each other for prominence. Still, Miletus was having the same problem of its harbor silting up and turning the area into a malaria-ridden swamp just like Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missler records that the Romans deforested the region, which caused the soil to erode into the rivers, which ended up in the harbor.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today, the coastline is several miles to the west.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The former harbor is an unappealing swamp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ephesus was restored by the Seljuk Turks during the Islamic period but never regained its glory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ephesus-new-testament-history&#34;&gt;Ephesus New Testament History&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church tradition places the Apostle John at Ephesus starting around AD 40. He is believed to have died around 100 and is buried at St. John&amp;rsquo;s Basilica, near the ancient Temple of Artemis. We believe John wrote his epistles and possibly his Gospel from Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common theme of his epistles emphasizes love and warnings about false teachers. The Gospel of John also contains several discourses on love and light. John develops a secondary theme: the Jerusalem establishment is bad shepherds, which is another way of saying false teachers leading the faithful astray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ephesus is likely more familiar to Christians as being connected with Paul and the books of Acts and Ephesians. Acts 18 tells us that Apollos, referenced several times in the New Testament, came to Ephesus knowing only of John the Baptist. Aquila and Priscilla &amp;ldquo;expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.&amp;rdquo; Apollos and Paul narrowly missed each other in Ephesus, having departed for Corinth before Paul arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/d11a5f4ff4359cc074dd9a9438e998d0.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city was also a focus of Paul&amp;rsquo;s third missionary Journey (Acts 19-20, see selected verses below). We can gather that Paul viewed Ephesus as a type of &amp;ldquo;ground zero&amp;rdquo; in the Jewish diaspora. As noted above, Acts 19 records a riot between Paul and those whose livelihood he threatened by turning people towards the one true God. Paul was not afraid to &amp;ldquo;mix it up&amp;rdquo; for the Gospel. This photo shows the Arcadian Way looking back up toward the theater. The acoustics are excellent. Despite the distance of the middle and upper seating sections, a person on the stage speaking in a moderate voice can easily be heard from there. The din of a shouting crowd would have been tremendous. As a testament to Roman engineering, a few excavated and restored theaters are still used today. The Roman theatre at Caesarea in Israel frequently has rock concerts and shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prophetically, Paul told the Ephesian elders to guard against the divisions and false teachings. In Revelation 2, Jesus would later commend the Ephesians for their diligence in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Act 20:27-31 For I did not shrink from proclaiming to you the whole plan of God. (28) &amp;ldquo;Watch out for yourselves, and for all the flock in which the Ruach HaKodesh has placed you as leaders, to shepherd God&amp;rsquo;s Messianic community, which he won for himself at the cost of his own Son&amp;rsquo;s blood. (29) I know that after I leave, savage wolves will come in among you, and they won&amp;rsquo;t spare the flock. (30) &lt;strong&gt;Even from among your own number, men will arise and teach perversions of the truth&lt;/strong&gt;, in order to drag away the talmidim after themselves. (31) So stay alert! Remember that for three years, night and day, with tears in my eyes, I never stopped warning you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeSilva notes the entire book of Revelation, not just the letter to Ephesus, &amp;ldquo;spoke a poignant word to Christians in a city so supportive of the Roman imperial cult and the Roman economy.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We can also understand why Paul faced such a fierce battle here. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t just presenting an alternate worldview as might be when someone converts today. &amp;ldquo;His proclamation of the one and only one God threatened the city&amp;rsquo;s very identity and its claim to fame, not to mention the livelihood of the concessioners like Demetrius whose trade depended on the worship of Artemis.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in Revelation, when John writes of a beast with a religious system that encompassed economic and devotional aspects, his first-century readers would have understood he was communicating Rome and its imperial cult system were thoroughly demonic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ephesus is mentioned 17 times in the New Testament, including twice in Revelation. By contrast, Thyatira is only mentioned one other time in Acts, and Laodicea is mentioned only four other times, all in Colossians. The other four cities are not mentioned elsewhere in the New Testament. Ephesus was the heavy hitter in this group of seven cities. Paul&amp;rsquo;s team likely brought the gospel to these six cities (and beyond) from Ephesus. It is somewhat curious that John and Paul&amp;rsquo;s paths appear not to have crossed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Act 19:1 And it happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the inland country and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act 19:17 And this became known to all the residents of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. And fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was extolled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act 19:26 And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost all of Asia this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great many people, saying that gods made with hands are not gods.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Act 19:34 But as soon as they recognized that he was a Jew, they began bellowing in unison, &amp;ldquo;Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!&amp;rdquo; and they kept it up for about two hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act 19:35 And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, “Men of Ephesus, who is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Artemis, and of the sacred stone that fell from the sky?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act 20:16 For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not have to spend time in Asia, for he was hastening to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(1) &amp;ldquo;To the angel of the (&lt;em&gt;ecclesia)&lt;/em&gt; Messianic Community in Ephesus, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven gold menorahs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mat 18:20 For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.”  Joh 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ecclesia&#34;&gt;Ecclesia&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cities such as Ephesus would likely have had several synagogues. The word &lt;em&gt;ecclesia&lt;/em&gt; reminds us that this is not to a denominational organization or a church building, but a body of believers set apart and called out to be a light in their city. Jesus expects His ecclesia to show evidence they are His, and where they are, there He is among them (Mat 18:20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, he holds them and is present with them. We explored the menorah symbolism previously so we won&amp;rsquo;t repeat it here. We can also draw a comparison to John 1:1 - Jesus is WITH God, meaning alongside and distinct from God the Father, and at the same time, WITH God, meaning He and the Father are indistinguishable. In many ways beyond our explanation, the same relationship is true with Jesus and His ecclesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will find that the English translation of the city name has some significance on the tone and content of each letter. Ephesus means &amp;ldquo;Desired one&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;darling.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This has meaning as later Jesus will say they lost the &amp;ldquo;love they had at first.&amp;rdquo; Commentators often assume Jesus is the darling and once desired One they stopped loving; however, there is another possibility we will explore. Ephesus was also a favored city in the Roman Empire; perhaps this pride had seeped its way into the fellowship. As we noted in the overview, Ephesus was also a place of great learning with an extensive library. However, eternal truth is not found in secular education but in Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;

(3) You are persevering, and you have suffered for my sake without growing weary.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eph&lt;/strong&gt; 4:14 We will then no longer be infants tossed about by the waves and blown along by every wind of teaching, at the mercy of people clever in devising ways to deceive.   Mat 7:23 Then I will tell them to their faces, &amp;lsquo;I never knew you! Get away from me, you workers of lawlessness!&amp;rsquo;   1 John 4:1 Beloved, do not believe every spirit but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 Cor 11:13-15 For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. 14 And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. 15 So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I know your works and your labor&amp;rdquo; is much more to the point. Jesus is passing a judgment on the &lt;strong&gt;results&lt;/strong&gt; of their body of work, what we might collectively call their &amp;ldquo;deeds.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I know what you have been doing&amp;rdquo; sounds like He&amp;rsquo;s only interested in how they have been passing the time. With that said, many Christians might start shaking if Jesus told us, &amp;ldquo;I know what you&amp;rsquo;ve been doing.&amp;rdquo; While that is true in the sense that He sees everything, I think the purpose here is the collective output of the work from the. body of believers. Chuck Missler tells the story of a child panicking when she realizes that Jesus sees her every move. Her grandfather reassured her by saying, &amp;ldquo;Jesus loves you so much, He can&amp;rsquo;t take His eyes off you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice Jesus didn&amp;rsquo;t say &amp;ldquo;I know what you believe&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I know what you profess to be true.&amp;rdquo; While we need to understand God properly, believers won&amp;rsquo;t be judged on how accurate our theology is. We will be judged based on our deeds and whether those deeds were effective for the Kingdom. For believers, this is not a judgment of our salvation but our rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are you and I doing at tolerating wickedness? Do we tolerate it? Wink at it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As discussed in the introduction, the Ephesians headed John&amp;rsquo;s and Paul&amp;rsquo;s warnings to weed out false teachers. Remember that the &amp;ldquo;wicked people,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;liars,&amp;rdquo; the people Paul labels as &amp;ldquo;Savage wolves&amp;rdquo; (Act 20:29), and the people John labels &amp;ldquo;deceivers and antichrists&amp;rdquo; (2 John 1:7) considered themselves to be Christians. It would be unnecessary to test pagans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are folks who called themselves Christians but are not. Later we will meet a group of people who call themselves Jews but are not. The plain sense is obvious. These are imposters, masquerading as members of the faith. Scholars believe this may have been a group called the &amp;ldquo;protognostics&amp;rdquo; or the early gnostics. Gnostics were a heretical offshoot that surprisingly influenced a good portion of early church theology. Note that they were not trying to attack the church but were infiltrating it. More damage to a church is done from within than without. Persecution often causes the true church to grow. It&amp;rsquo;s easier to stand up when you can see the enemy. The problem with church divisions is that the enemy masquerades as a fellow believer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ephesians 4:14, Paul compares a group we might call &amp;ldquo;believers with an agenda&amp;rdquo; to a storm at sea. We aren&amp;rsquo;t told whether they knew they were deceiving or whether their beliefs were genuine but in error. I don&amp;rsquo;t think we can assume all one group or the other. It is probably a mix. The group, along with true charlatans, were self-deceived people, and as a result, they were inadvertently deceiving others. In either case, they came with an agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest person in the whole world to fool is yourself. We said a believer shouldn&amp;rsquo;t fear when reading Revelation, but there is one critically important exception. We need to have a healthy fear of God. Jesus called these believers &amp;ldquo;evil liars.&amp;rdquo; It is to this group; He will speak those terrible words, &amp;ldquo;I never knew you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of which group Jesus had in mind in the first century, a fair question we all should ask from time to time is, &amp;ldquo;I call myself a believer; how do I know Jesus wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call me an evil liar?&amp;rdquo; Am I absolutely sure Jesus won&amp;rsquo;t tell me, &amp;ldquo;depart from me; I never knew you&amp;rdquo;? I see no harm in making sure we are safely NOT in this group. The best companies with nothing to hide still conduct internal and external auditing and monitoring as a way of making certain minor mistakes don’t turn into catastrophic problems. They confidently open their books for inspection. They do not do this from a position of fear. They aren&amp;rsquo;t worried that the auditors might find something. Mature companies EXPECT auditors to find things the company can then correct and become stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no reason, as believers, we should not have the same mindset. This is what Jesus is communicating in the sermon on the mount (Mat 5-7). Allow the Holy Spirit to audit our books. Show us where we are making mistakes so we can be stronger talmidim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ephesians were great external auditors; they could spot fatal flaws in others. However, we&amp;rsquo;re about to find out they were terrible internal auditors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(4) But I have this against you: you have lost the love you had at first. (5) Therefore, remember where you were before you fell, turn from this sin, and do what you used to do before. Otherwise, I will come to you and remove your menorah from its place—if you don&amp;rsquo;t turn from your sin!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jer 2:2 “Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, Thus says the LORD, “I remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride, how you followed me in the wilderness, in a land not sown.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is often described as the loss of love for Jesus, but we must note they were commended for being tested and suffering for His sake without growing weary. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine anyone suffering for Jesus who didn&amp;rsquo;t love him. We don&amp;rsquo;t usually suffer for someone we don&amp;rsquo;t love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternate theory might be as they were testing others, they were all truth and no love. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that they didn&amp;rsquo;t directly love Jesus, but more didn&amp;rsquo;t manifest that love in their treatment of others. They became insular. If we&amp;rsquo;ve been around long enough, we will eventually visit a church like this and probably have met Christians like this. They may teach the word and have the most solid doctrine, but you can feel something is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not just any deficiency. This is a sin that can lead to our light being extinguished. Think about those people who are all rules and have no love. Do you find yourself wanting to be around them? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus says the two greatest commandments are Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 19:18. Both have to do with love. I believe a plausible argument for what was happening at Ephesus was that, in the onslaught of false teachers, they became cynical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sympathetic. They were in an environment where they had to be immediately suspicious of everyone they met. If they weren&amp;rsquo;t believers, were they there to inform against them? If they claimed to be a believer, were they running a con so they could entrap or infiltrate? If their motives were seemingly pure, were they nonetheless one of the false teachers Paul had warned them to weed out? I&amp;rsquo;m not surprised if they tended to become insular and protective. When we are like this, we are not outward-focused. When we are not outward-focused, we are not letting our lights shine. We are not loving our neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is calling them to repent of this and repent now. The mark of a true believer is the ability to repent when he is wrong. The Greek word metanoia, translated as repent, implies changing one&amp;rsquo;s thinking in response in truth. The Hebrew word for repentance, תְשׁוּבָה - teshuva, is more action-oriented. The root means &amp;ldquo;return&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;turn around now!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you do not&amp;rdquo; means we have free will. Although it is difficult to imagine a regenerate believer not responding to Jesus, ultimately we have the freedom to not repent. This verse can be read from several different eternal security perspectives depending on one&amp;rsquo;s pre-established position on the matter. Dr. Fructenbaum points out that, like our fellowships today, 1st-century congregations likely had a mix of true believers and unsaved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;silting&#34;&gt;Silting&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke above how Ephesus lost its prominence, not by majestic conquest, but by gradual silting. The silting occurred gradually; it&amp;rsquo;s doubtful the citizens even noticed. Yet today, what was once a grand harbor is now a marshy swamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Ephesian Christians lost their first love by allowing the silt of spiritual indifference to accumulate over the years. It can happen, can&amp;rsquo;t it? Love for Jesus is the hub from which every other activity (including deeds and doctrine) should flow.&amp;rdquo; – Wayne Stiles&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Psa 26:5 I hate the assembly of evildoers, and I will not sit with the wicked&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two critical questions we must ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who were the Nicolaitans?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we know we are NOT Nicolaitans?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 2:6 (Ephesus) and Revelation 2:14-15 (Pergamum) refer to the deeds and teaching of this group called the Nicolaitans. There&amp;rsquo;s an obvious question: &amp;ldquo;Who were the Nicolaitans?&amp;rdquo; We have no historical record of them before the Revelation. There is also a less obvious question: &amp;ldquo;How do I know I am not a Nicolaitan?&amp;rdquo; Without knowing their deeds and teachings, we could unknowingly be doing and teaching the same things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that anyone could make up anything they wanted to define who the Nicolaitans were after the fact. Here&amp;rsquo;s a hypothetical illustration. Suppose no one had ever heard the term &amp;ldquo;bear left&amp;rdquo; when suddenly it appeared in a set of directions. We could imagine a son asking his father, &amp;ldquo;Dad, what does &amp;lsquo;bear left&amp;rsquo; mean?&amp;rdquo; The answer could be, &amp;ldquo;well son, one time a bear was chasing a man, and he veered slightly to the left. The bear didn&amp;rsquo;t follow, and the man made it to safety. That&amp;rsquo;s what the term bear left means.&amp;rdquo; Of course, that answer is absurd. Just because words sound the same doesn&amp;rsquo;t automatically mean they&amp;rsquo;re linguistically connected (and the root word for bearing or heading has zero connection to the carnivorous mammal). But that&amp;rsquo;s basically what we are left with when trying to figure out who the Nicolaitans were. Scholars assume the definition is contained within the word &amp;ldquo;Nicolaitans&amp;rdquo;; they just aren&amp;rsquo;t sure what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, we know we must limit our conjectures to things that would have made sense to the original audience. While we don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly, we can make an educated guess about the nature of their deeds. The letter to Ephesus gives us no additional information but based on Revelation 2:14, Jesus speaks of the Nicolaitans in the context of sexual and dietary misconduct. For this, we need to dive into Acts 15 for some background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-acts-15-decision&#34;&gt;The Acts 15 Decision&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more Gentiles wanted to join the Jewish sect of the Nazarenes, a division arose among the Jewish leadership. Were these Gentiles going to be required to do a complete conversion to Judaism? In many respects, requiring conversion made sense. Ours is a Jewish sect with a Jewish Rabbi Jewish apostles, worshiping in Jewish synagogues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter, among others, made an impassioned plea that Judaism is a discipline as much as it is a religion or ethnicity. The sages speak of taking on the &amp;ldquo;yoke of the Torah.&amp;rdquo; We see this reference in Acts 15:10. The picture shows a plow where a pair of oxen would be yoked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we grow, we can take on more of that yoke. However, just as one would not attach a heavy load to a baby ox, Peter said we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t put the total weight of the Torah on a new adult gentile believer. The early church fathers agreed that Gentile converts to Judaism would be welcomed, but immediate conversion (signified by circumcision for males) was not required. In other words, Gentile believers were not required to take on the entire &amp;ldquo;yoke.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this said, new believers were to set themselves apart from pagans in four critical areas. These are recorded in Acts 15:28-29:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements: (29) that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these deals with feeding our flesh. The first three pertain to guardrails around the food they ate, and the last one has to do with keeping sexually pure. As we progress through the seven letters, we will see that these two categories are recurring concerns of Jesus (as we see in Rev 2:14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is evidence that these four stipulations were only intended as a starting point. A late 1st-century document called the &lt;em&gt;Didache&lt;/em&gt; appears to be a manual written by the Apostles with further instructions for growing Gentile talmidim, who were be expected to grow in maturity and gradually adopt additional Torah requirements. They did this not as a legalistic &amp;ldquo;got to&amp;rdquo; but as a grateful &amp;ldquo;get to.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind the list of restrictions mentioned in Acts is not a complete set of prohibitions. Were they allowed to steal and murder? Of course not. These four sins were specific challenges to new gentile followers of the Jewish messiah living in a Roman world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also need to discuss some background on &amp;ldquo;food&amp;rdquo; versus &amp;ldquo;not food&amp;rdquo; in the Jewish mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today most gentiles have categories: &amp;ldquo;food&amp;rdquo; is anything we desire to eat, and &amp;ldquo;not food&amp;rdquo; is everything else. Note the individual determines what food is and what is not, not God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Leviticus 11, Observant Jews have three categories, and it is God who determines which is in which type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Unclean Animals = Not food: this includes pork, anything that is a scavenger, and sea creatures without fins and scales. Items in category 1 are not &amp;ldquo;unclean food.&amp;rdquo; They are not food at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Food: vegetation, beef, and other land mammals meeting the requirements, fish, and fowl (unless otherwise excluded)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Unclean Food: the items in category #2, killed or prepared improperly, such as being strangled or found already dead (Lev 22:8), still containing lifeblood (Lev 7:26), or sacrificed to idols (Num 25:2-3). Also, fruit from a tree planted within three years is unclean and not to be eaten (Lev 11:34)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while they did not put the whole yoke of the Torah on new Gentile believers, it does appear they imposed the total weight as it pertains to dietary restrictions and sexual boundaries. Scholars debate this, but it becomes challenging to read Acts 15 any other way (don&amp;rsquo;t take my word for it; do your own research). You must think Jewish. Would it have made sense for a group of observant Jews to say it is OK to eat pork that was not dedicated to an idol, but it is not OK for them to eat the lamb that was so dedicated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to cloud the matter further, but the biblical dietary laws are not exactly the same as &amp;ldquo;keeping Kosher&amp;rdquo; as it&amp;rsquo;s practiced today. Modern rabbis have imposed many additional restrictions not directly in the Bible, such as it is forbidden to have dairy and meat in the same meal. There are no cheeseburgers at Kosher McDonalds in Israel. And there definitely are no bacon cheeseburgers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One additional nuance: Judaism was a recognized religion in the Roman empire, which means they were allowed to keep their dietary regulations. While most food sold in the market had been offered to one or more Roman gods, Jewish food was not. Lizorkin says, &amp;ldquo;Jews had their own slaughtering rules and privileges…food delivery and consumption did not follow the normal route of offerings to the Roman gods.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As mentioned in different contexts, Gentiles did not have this option. Almost everything they bought would have been offered to an idol. In other words, this requirement would have likely caused significant hardship on believing gentiles, but the Church required it because they were called to be separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul addresses many of these same challenges in his letters, particularly 1 Corinthians. Paul, who acknowledged that false gods were nothing, still sided with the Jerusalem council and forbade followers from eating food in any way associated with the Roman imperial cult (1 cor 8). If our view of Paul is that he came to set all rules aside, we may need to double-check our interpretation against Paul&amp;rsquo;s actual words recorded in Scripture. Again we see the importance of Acts 17:11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 15 also includes abstaining from sexual impropriety. Ephesus had a notorious brothel in addition to the male and female prostitutes at the temple of Diana. This picture is from a sidewalk in Ephesus. The heart shape on the upper left is filled with dots, interpreted as money being dropped into either a metaphorical heart or a literal purse. The left footprint is considered a directional indicator so that even the illiterate would know in which direction to go. A building interpreted as a brothel was found on the left side of this same block, in the foot&amp;rsquo;s direction. To the right of the footprint, there is also a drawing of a woman with a crown, usually taken as a representation of a prostitute. The followers of Jesus were to shun all immorality, which was prevalent in their day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food and sexual misconduct are two recurrent themes in the seven letters. These were also two items of Balaam&amp;rsquo;s treachery referenced in 2:14. As Lizorkin states, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to notice that out of four behaviors forbidden to Gentiles, two had to do with the Nicolaitans and the Balaam/Balak issues.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, let&amp;rsquo;s explore the three main conjectures present in most commentaries. According to each theory, their view is related to the supposed etymology of the word &amp;ldquo;Nicolaitans&amp;rdquo; and thus would have been understood by the original audience. Remember our &amp;ldquo;bear left&amp;rdquo; story above as we explore each of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;conjecture-1-an-early-type-of-clergy-that-ruled-the-people-laity-with-a-heavy-hand&#34;&gt;Conjecture #1: An early type of clergy that ruled the people (laity) with a heavy hand&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rationale: the word &amp;ldquo;Nicolaitans&amp;rdquo; comes from νικαω (to rule, conquer) and λαος (people, laity)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, even though the Apostles commissioned bishops, pastors, elders, and deacons, some in these offices let power go to their heads. On the surface, this seems plausible because we know how power can corrupt. Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;The servant is not greater than his lord.&amp;rdquo; John 13:16. Our Lord washed feet. Even his two great disciples, James and John, appeared to jockey for status by asking to sit at Jesus&amp;rsquo; right and left hands. So on the surface, this one sounds excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the more I study the context, the more I have trouble with this one. If this is supposedly leadership ruling over the laity, how is the Ephesian leadership in a position to resist this? In other words, a group wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to advance this position unless they were already in authority, which in Ephesus, the Nicolaitans clearly were not. How could the Pergamum assembly embrace it if they were subjected to inappropriate authority?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no historical basis for this position other than taking the words Nikao and Laos and putting them together. In some ways, it sounds like a contrived dig against the Catholic Church, which of course, would make it anachronistic. There is no way the audience could have foreseen a heavy-handed clergy restricting the rights of the laity when such behavior was probably at least 200 years in the future. While it&amp;rsquo;s true we&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed the bad fruit of such abuses of authority in recent years (and indeed abuses dating back to the middle ages), that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean these abuses were present in the 1st century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to the point, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit the context of the letter to Pergamum, which clearly deals with sexual and dietary misconduct. With that said, many people I greatly respect who are much smarter than I am, promote this view. So, we&amp;rsquo;ll hold in in our realm of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;conjecture-2-a-gnostic-cult-founded-by-nicholas-one-of-the-original-acts-65-deacons&#34;&gt;Conjecture #2: A Gnostic cult founded by Nicholas, one of the original Acts 6:5 deacons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rationale: the word &amp;ldquo;Nicolaitans&amp;rdquo; comes from νικολαον, &amp;ldquo;Nicholas&amp;rdquo; in reference to the deacon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view has historical evidence to support it (documented by Iraneus and others), but again it is documented after the fact so that it could be a &amp;ldquo;bear left&amp;rdquo; type of fable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Nicholas-followers believed all acts of the flesh (specifically sexual and likely dietary) were eternally meaningless. A core tenet of Gnosticism is that only the soul matters, so why not indulge in pleasures of the flesh? They held that Jesus was a spirit being who only appeared to be physical. For example, when he walked, he didn&amp;rsquo;t leave footprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view led to the gnostics ignoring Acts 15. If only the soul matters; they didn&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about physical restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that Gnostics were a heretical group and were a problem for the early church. Much of John&amp;rsquo;s epistles refute Gnosticism, and they are a strong candidate for the people for whom Jesus describes as &amp;ldquo;saying they are apostles but are not.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas Paul admonished us to keep the sinful flesh in check, Gnostics held that &amp;ldquo;anything goes&amp;rdquo; (yes, anything) because the flesh doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. As a result, they lived with unrestrained indulgence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One version has Nicholas himself (interestingly the only Gentile among the seven deacons) teaching strange ways. Another variant of the story is that Nicholas reportedly chose to live a celibate life after his conversion. One slight problem: he was already married. He decided to divorce his wife so that she would be free to marry another. At his divorce, he reportedly said, &amp;ldquo;anyone who desires her may have her.&amp;rdquo; According to Lancaster, this is a relatively standard Jewish language for divorcing his wife to allow her to remarry.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So he what he thought was right but didn&amp;rsquo;t set out to start a heretical sect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, Gnostics, who did not know the Jewish context for the quote and were infamous for twisting words, did exactly that. In their view, the quote was, &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;everyone&lt;/strong&gt; who desires her may have her.&amp;rdquo; The Nicolaitans, these Nicholas-followers, were permissive in all things, notably sexual impropriety, even though they professed faith in Jesus as their savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, the story reads like it is contrived. It&amp;rsquo;s as if someone said, &amp;ldquo;The Gnostics are bad. Let me tell you how bad they are…&amp;rdquo; and then made up this story about Nicholas to connect the evil Gnostics to the mysterious Nicolaitans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, this is probably the leading candidate from a 1st-century context perspective. But there is one other that is intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;conjecture-3-a-heretical-sect-that-claimed-the-jewish-dietary-laws-were-done-away-with&#34;&gt;Conjecture #3: A heretical sect that claimed the Jewish dietary laws were done away with&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rationale: Nicolaitans νικολαιτων is a &amp;ldquo;Hebraism&amp;rdquo;: a transliteration of the Hebrew word &amp;ldquo;נֹאכֵל&amp;rdquo; (nochel - let us/we will eat!) made into a plural noun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, this was the &amp;ldquo;we will eat anything&amp;rdquo; sect. According to Lizorkin, the earliest mention of this theory is John Lightfoot (mid-1600&amp;rsquo;s). Still, Lizorkin claims, the view is &amp;ldquo;is consistent with Revelation as a Jewish, anti-Roman document&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and &amp;ldquo;would make a strong connection in the context of Balaam and Balak.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this view, these &amp;ldquo;nochelaitans&amp;rdquo; possibly said something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;we have freedom in Christ, don&amp;rsquo;t we? Therefore, we can eat whatever we want, and God will bless us.&amp;rdquo; They were the &amp;ldquo;we will eat&amp;rdquo; people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Numbers, Balaam and Balak ensnared Israel by sexual sin and a banquet of idolatry. The Israelites, believers in Israel&amp;rsquo;s God, somehow rationalized that it was ok to partake. In so doing, the Israelites brought God&amp;rsquo;s judgment upon themselves. Jesus says that whoever the Nicolaitans are, they are doing and teaching the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus mentions food several times and is specifically concerned about eating food sacrificed to idols. In the promise to the Ephesians, those who overcome will be allowed to eat from the tree of life (we can read that as PROPER food). The Ballam and Balak incident is about feasting on forbidden idol food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While, in some respects, this sounds like a &amp;ldquo;bear left&amp;rdquo; made-up story, Lizorkin believes this view &amp;ldquo;makes more sense in the natural Jewish context&amp;rdquo; (than the other presumed definitions of Nicolaitans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, all three conjectures are educated guesses. Ultimately, we can&amp;rsquo;t prove who the Nicolaitans were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;nicolaitans-summary&#34;&gt;Nicolaitans summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three conjectures for the Nicolaitans share a common theme: they were a group of people who said, &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;re doing it our way,&amp;rdquo; despite what the Bible says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember the second question we asked at the beginning of this discussion? &amp;ldquo;How do we know we are not Nicolaitans?&amp;rdquo; The Nicolaitans were professing believers that had intentionally or unintentionally gotten off track. Maybe a third question we could ask is, &amp;ldquo;Did the Nicolaitans know Jesus hated their deeds before hearing John&amp;rsquo;s letter to Ephesus?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to think they were surprised. Most cult members sincerely believe in their cult&amp;rsquo;s teachings. One can be sincere in his beliefs and still be very wrong. This means that unknowingly there could be Nicolaitans (at least in the broad sense of Jesus hating their deeds) among us. Indeed, if we have strayed, ever so slightly from Jesus&#39; teachings, WE could also be doing the deeds of the Nicolaitans. Often a cult starts by taking a truth and overemphasizing it to the point of error. For example, many Christians today say, &amp;ldquo;I can do anything because Paul said, &amp;lsquo;all things are lawful.&#39;&amp;rdquo; The problem with this view is that it is out of context. In 1 Corinthians 6:12, Paul is quoting an argument of his opponents. Most assuredly, all things are NOT lawful for believers. The Bible calls us to be set apart from the world around us. Society is, of course, trying to tell the church that all kinds of sexual behavior (heterosexual promiscuity and otherwise) should be tolerated. Still, the Bible tells us to be set apart from the world around us, and that marriage is between one man and one woman forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many conservative Christians know that sexual sin is terrible, but we don&amp;rsquo;t think about what we eat. Perhaps the matter is not as cut and dry as we may think. Jesus links food and sexual appetites. We are supposed to be called out from non-believers and, according to the apostles, our diet is one way we do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a question to see whether there are traces of Nicolaitanism in us: if God gave us a command, but He didn&amp;rsquo;t provide what we thought was a &amp;ldquo;good reason,&amp;rdquo; what would we do? Would we obey as an act of devotion, or would we insist on doing it our way? Doing it our way is the teaching of the Nicolaitans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard a story of a Jew who said something to the effect of &amp;ldquo;Lord, if it were up to me, I would eat the delicious pig. But because you prohibit it, I will honor you and not eat the delicious pig.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may wonder why Jesus would care what we do, provided we believe in our hearts. I can&amp;rsquo;t speak for Jesus&amp;rsquo; reasons, but I only know that He does care. In some sense, everyone He chastises in these letters presumably had their &amp;ldquo;hearts in the right place.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our question is, &amp;ldquo;how will I choose to serve Him today?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;hate-the-sin-love-the-sinner&#34;&gt;Hate the sin; love the sinner.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note how Jesus says, &amp;ldquo;you hate what they do,&amp;rdquo; not &amp;ldquo;you hate the Nicolaitans as people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to get that backward – we hate the person but wink at the sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-27-promise-to-the-overcomer--ears&#34;&gt;Rev 2:7: Promise to the Overcomer / Ears&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(7) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.  To him winning the victory (or &amp;ldquo;him who overcomes&amp;rdquo;), I will give the right to eat from the Tree of Life which is in God&amp;rsquo;s Gan-`Eden.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 3:22-24 Then the LORD God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever—” 23 therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken. 24 He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life. Is 51:3 For the LORD comforts Zion; he comforts all her waste places and makes her wilderness like Eden, her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness will be found in her, thanksgiving and the voice of song.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;he-who-has-an-ear&#34;&gt;He who has an ear&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase can be said to be Jesus&#39; signature line; it frequently appears in the Gospels and each of the seven letters. Recall what we discussed in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://talmidimway.org/commentary/revelation/2-greetings-rev-1-1-11/#rev-13-the-blessing&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;previous lesson about the Hebrew word שָׁמַע (shama),&lt;/a&gt; which implies putting what we hear into action, versus passively listening. Baruch says that this phrase means the messages are directed to the saved.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:21&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-overcomers&#34;&gt;The overcomers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each letter, there will be a promise made to overcomers, or as Paul might say, those who finish the race well. In the last four letters, the promise comes before &amp;ldquo;He who has an ear,&amp;rdquo; whereas the promise comes after in the first three. We aren&amp;rsquo;t told the reason for this inversion, but it is conspicuous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;tree-of-life&#34;&gt;Tree of life&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first mention of the Tree of Life is in Genesis 2:9. &amp;ldquo;The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.&amp;rdquo; Eve then Adam ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and their eyes were opened to sin. God intervened before they could eat from the Tree of Life. Otherwise, they would have lived for eternity in their sinful state. As we see in the verses above, God drove them out of Eden and then blocked the way back. Now fast-forward to the end of the story, and Jesus is ready to open that way back up again; however, we do not want to eat of the tree until our sin state has been fully addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned above, Jesus is apparently stating that there will be a group of people who think they are believers who do not ultimately eat of the Tree of Life. See Matthew 7:21-22 and Luke 6:46. Whether these people lost their salvation or were never really saved is immaterial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is supremely material is that 21st-century believers follow Jesus&#39; instructions and make sure we are in the &amp;ldquo;overcomer&amp;rdquo; category. Our behavior matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, just as there are other Flood accounts, several different cultures, including the Babylonians, Assyrians, Hindus, Arabs, and Greeks have the equivalent of the Tree of Life in their legends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating implies fellowship. Beyond nourishment, the one who overcomes gets to fellowship with Yeshua and share in the Eternal Order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One central theme of the letters is not one of the assemblies viewed itself the way Jesus viewed it. The Ephesians believed that right beliefs and solid doctrine were all that was expected. Jesus demands our affection.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:22&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are the tie-ins to the conjectures mentioned in Lesson 5. Remember these are parallels in a broad sense and we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t hold too tightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name meaning: desired (one) or darling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Church age theory: Apostolic church (70-170)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pauline counterpart theory:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ephesians&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example: Eph 4:14 so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kingdom Parable theory: Four soils – Matthew 13:3-9; 18-23&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 13:3-9 He told them many things in parables: &amp;ldquo;A farmer went out to sow his seed. (4) As he sowed, some seed fell alongside the path; and the birds came and ate it up. (5) Other seed fell on rocky patches where there was not much soil. It sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow; (6) but when the sun had risen, the young plants were scorched; and since their roots were not deep, they dried up. (7) Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. (8) But others fell into rich soil and produced grain, a hundred or sixty or thirty times as much as had been sown. (9) Those who have ears, let them hear!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 13:18-23 &amp;ldquo;So listen to what the parable of the sower means. (19) Whoever hears the message about the Kingdom, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand it, is like the seed sown along the path—the Evil One comes and seizes what was sown in his heart. (20) The seed sown on rocky ground is like a person who hears the message and accepts it with joy at once, (21) but has no root in himself. So he stays on for a while; but as soon as some trouble or persecution arises on account of the message, he immediately falls away. (22) Now the seed sown among thorns stands for someone who hears the message, but it is choked by the worries of the world and the deceitful glamor of wealth, so that it produces nothing. (23) However, what was sown on rich soil is the one who hears the message and understands it; such a person will surely bear fruit, a hundred or sixty or thirty times what was sown.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time, we will look at Smyrna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Smyrna, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the First and the Last, who died and came alive again: (9) &amp;ldquo;I know how you are suffering and how poor you are (though in fact you are rich!), and I know the insults of those who call themselves Jews but aren&amp;rsquo;t—on the contrary, they are a synagogue of the Adversary. (10) Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid of what you are about to suffer. Look, the Adversary is going to have some of you thrown in prison, in order to put you to the test; and you will face an ordeal for ten days. Remain faithful, even to the point of death; and I will give you life as your crown. (11) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities. He who wins the victory will not be hurt at all by the second death.&amp;rdquo; &#39;&lt;/td&gt;

This resulted in economic prosperity, though Smyrna was never as commercially significant as Ephesus. The map below shows Smyrna&amp;rsquo;s location respective to Ephesus and Pergamum. It&amp;rsquo;s about 42 miles north of Ephesus. Like Ephesus, the harbor eventually became silted over and the modern shoreline is a few miles to the west.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Ephesus, which tended to pick the wrong side during the great imperial battles of antiquity, Smyrna did not. In fact, they were steadfastly loyal to Rome. This was true long before Rome came to power. They built a temple to Roma, the deified personification of Rome in 195 BCE, when Smyrna was in Greek hands.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strabo, the great geographer of antiquity, indicated that the ancient Smyrnans believed their city to be the birthplace of Homer and had what they called a Homerium: a temple to Homer and a statue. Strabo also said that Smyrna was &amp;ldquo;the most beautiful city in Ionia.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern Turkish city of Izmir sits atop where we believe ancient Smyrna is. This has significantly limited archaeological excavation. Because of this, we are unable to confirm any Jewish/Christian presence in the city at the time Revelation was written. However as scholars will point out, &amp;ldquo;absence of evidence, is not evidence of absence.&amp;rdquo; Bolen points out the modern city of Izmir, &amp;ldquo;has a long history of Jewish residents, evidenced by the number of synagogues in the area of the historic city…at one time there were nine synagogues located on a single street.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of all the seven cities mentioned in Revelation, only Smyrna (Izmir) survives as a continuously inhabited city.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-roman-imperial-cult&#34;&gt;The Roman Imperial Cult&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Ephesus, the culture of Smyrna was deeply seated in the worship of what is called the Roman Imperial Cult. They were described as &amp;ldquo;being loyal to Rome and its gods, even unto death.&amp;rdquo; This is one of those likely local allusions (or maybe a better word is a &amp;lsquo;pun&amp;rsquo;) Jesus makes in Rev 2:10, when He says, &amp;ldquo;Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/0328930d97a78c3b85e84522af8a2260.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;30%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;We see an example of this in an inscription to Hadrian found at Smyrna. The dedication describes Hadrian as &amp;ldquo;Olympian, Savior, and Founder.&amp;rdquo; (Ὀλυμπίωι σωτῆρι καὶ κτίστηι).&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; By calling him &amp;ldquo;Olympian,&amp;rdquo; they are saying Hadrian is equivalent to Zeus. It is no accident that they used words challenging the status of Jesus as Savior. Even though Hadrian would have been after the time John wrote (this dedication dates to 128 CE), this is still illustrative of the culture the believers in Smyrna found themselves. Even though after the fact, labeling Hadrian as &amp;ldquo;founder&amp;rdquo; is in opposition to Jesus calling Himself &amp;ldquo;the First and the Last.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emperor worship was mandatory. The law required citizens to make an annual offering and acknowledge publicly that Caesar was supreme lord. They received a certificate that they had done so, after which they were permitted to worship whatever gods they wanted. As we have noted, ethnic Jews were in a protected class and exempted from this by law, but gentile believers were not. This led to significant tensions between Jews (both believing and non-believing) and Gentile followers of Yeshua, the Jewish Messiah, with the former group being called to publicly denounce the latter. The lack of &amp;ldquo;proper papers&amp;rdquo; showing this group refused to worship Caesar added to the pressure believers and those protecting them were under (remember in Nazi Germany, those who aided and abetted Jews were sent to camps or killed on the spot the same as the Jews they helped).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in Ephesus, there was a large area called an Agora that served as a civic forum and also had areas for shopping. All of this was under the watchful eye of altars to Zeus, Poseidon, Demeter, and Artemis. It appears that Cybele, the Phrygian mother goddess, was the patron goddess of Smyrna. According to legend, Cybele is the mother of Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. Numerous coins minted in Smyrna bear her image.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Today, we can see many arches that were built to support the Agora following the earthquake in 178 AD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another possible allusion in the letter occurs when Jesus refers to Himself as the one &amp;ldquo;who died and came to life.&amp;rdquo; Smyrna was destroyed and rebuilt multiple times, often by an earthquake. In addition to the quake in 178 CE, A significant temblor in 179 BCE destroyed much of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;new-testament-smyrna&#34;&gt;New Testament Smyrna&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Rev 2:8 is the only mention of Smyrna in the Bible, we believe Paul traveled to Troas passing through Smyrna and Pergamum, on his way to Greece as recorded in Acts 20. Paul also spent more than two years in Ephesus, so he could have made a trip to Smyrna. Acts 19:10 states, &amp;quot; This continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of the Bible, Smyrna is best known in Christian circles as the town where Polycarp was martyred. Polycarp was a disciple of John the Apostle and was the Bishop of Smyrna&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. A later tradition has Polycarp being betrayed by non-believing Jews, but this appears to be an anti-Semitic addition in an anachronistic attempt to libel the Jews with additional crimes against Christians and force-fulfill the prophecy in Revelation 2 regarding the persecution of the Smyrnan believers. History shows this persecution was at the hands of the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest records indicate that Polycarp was brought before the provincial governor. DeSilva writes, &amp;ldquo;the governor might not have known about the Christian faith, but he knew that it drew people away from giving the gods their due.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For this reason, this sect of the Nazarenes was an existential threat to the Roman way of life and had to be dealt with, &amp;lsquo;east of all by &amp;ldquo;Rome&amp;rsquo;s oldest and most faithful of allies.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The martyrdom of Polycarp records the dialogue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City official: What harm is it to say, &amp;lsquo;Caesar is Lord&amp;rsquo; and to offer a sacrifice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polycarp: For eighty-six years I have served Him, and He has wronged me in no way. How then, can I revile my King, who rescued me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this refusal, Polycarp was then attempted to be burned at the stake. The story goes that, like Shadraq, Mishaq, and Abednego in the book of Daniel, the fires danced around Polycarp but did not harm. When fire failed to do the job, Polycarp was then stabbed to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story – how much of it is true we don&amp;rsquo;t know – illustrates Jesus&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;no compromise&amp;rdquo; position to his faithful. No matter how bad things get, &amp;ldquo;even to the point of death&amp;rdquo; we must never deny Him. Conversely, for Christians, we know the end of our lives in this world is not the end of the story. Along with the story of Polycarp, the letter to Smyrna serves as a reminder to keep the heavenly perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(8) &amp;ldquo;And to the angel of the (&lt;em&gt;ecclesia)&lt;/em&gt; Messianic Community in Smyrna, write: ‘The words of the first and the last, who died and came to life.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 41:4 Who has performed and done this, calling the generations from the beginning? I, the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he Isa 44:6 Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: “I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god &lt;br&gt;Isa 48:12 “Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel, whom I called! I am he; I am the first, and I am the last.  &lt;br&gt;Rev 22:13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”  &lt;br&gt;Mat 2:11 And going into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. &lt;br&gt;Mar 15:23 And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. &lt;br&gt;Joh 19:39 Nicodemus also, who earlier had come to Jesus by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds in weight. &lt;br&gt;Isa 60:6 A multitude of camels shall cover you, the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all those from Sheba shall come. They shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall bring good news, the praises of the LORD. &lt;em&gt;(note: no Myrrh)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;myrrh&#34;&gt;Myrrh&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/b13284f70d65fa882b0f9370c6ea72d5.jpg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;Smyrna meaning: related to Myrrh, which is often used as an embalming ointment. As you can see in the photo, it starts out as a resin but must be crushed to activate its full potential. Is there a lesson for us as believers given what we are about to read? Smyrna was one of the chief exporters of Myrrh to the ancient world. We mentioned in the Ephesus lesson how many of the goods listed in Revelation 18 would have passed through the ports of Western Turkey. Myrrh is specifically named in Rev 18:13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myrrh was one of the three gifts the Magi brought at Jesus&amp;rsquo; birth along with gold and frankincense (Mat 2:11). Scholars see these gifts as prophetically speaking of Jesus as King (gold), Priest (frankincense), and His death as a prophet (myrrh, as most biblical prophets died as martyrs). We see it mentioned twice at Jesus&#39; death. Once while He was on the cross (Mark 15:23, here used as an anesthetic) and another in John 19:39 when Nicodemus came to embalm Jesus after His death. Missler pointed out that in Isaiah 60:6, which describes the second coming, there will be gold and frankincense, but no Myrrh. His death is behind Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;description-of-messiah&#34;&gt;Description of Messiah&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The description of Messiah is taken from Rev 1:17-18: &amp;quot; “Don’t be afraid! I am the First and the Last, the Living One. I was dead, but look!—I am alive forever and ever!&amp;rdquo; The First and the Last is a frequent title of Adonai, whom we would call God the Father. It also occurs four times in Revelation, including twice with the addition &amp;ldquo;was dead and am alive.&amp;rdquo; This indicates that just as John 1:1 says &amp;ldquo;…and the word WAS God,&amp;rdquo; there is a blending of God the Father and God the Son. We have some other &amp;ldquo;First and the Last&amp;rdquo; references above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Jas 1:2-3 Regard it all as joy, my brothers, when you face various kinds of temptations; (3) for you know that the testing of your trust produces perseverance.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tribulation – θλιψιν (thliphsis)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/754c8fbe9bcebb37645299cdfe25539e.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;The root word for tribulation means simply &amp;ldquo;pressure&amp;rdquo;. It can be compared to the pressure used to extract juice from grapes or oil from olives. However, it does not necessarily have to denote physical persecution. As we mentioned above, believers in Smyrna clearly had to live their lives as a fringe group. They did not have religious protections like we do today (for now). They would have been ostracized, perhaps not able to hold jobs or purchase necessities, and likely were under constant threat of being arrested. Much of this would have been true for Jewish as well as Gentile believers in Messiah. Non-Jewish believers had the added pressure of being required to participate in the emperor-worship ceremony. Like Tom Bradford, a commentator, stated, &amp;ldquo;you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be beaten to feel beaten down.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being outside of the mainstream economy likely meant that many believers were materially poor. In fact, there are two Greek words for poverty: one means having nothing fancy, and the other means being destitute and reduced to begging. Jesus uses the second one, πτωχειαν ptocheia, here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus reminds them to have the heavenly view. From a kingdom perspective, they are rich. We&amp;rsquo;ve said before that a major theme of these letters is that the recipients didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily see themselves as Jesus sees them. This cuts both ways. Certainly, for the letters containing judgments, we can infer that this material deficiency in their faith that Jesus called out probably came as a surprise. In the same way, the believers of Smyrna thought they were poor, but they held the wrong perspective. We all need to have a kingdom perspective, no matter the circumstances of our earthly situation. Remember a simple motion of worshipping the emperor, which they could have faked, would have given them their papers and alleviated most of the suffering. Were some of them second-guessing that decision? Jesus affirms they made the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Antisemitic interpretations of 2:9&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I need to say how thankful I am for the work of Chuck Missler. While he wasn&amp;rsquo;t perfect in all his analyses (indeed none of us are), he took a firm stance against Replacement Rheology. In the early 90s, shortly after I came to faith, a co-worker told me I had to listen to Chuck. He was on the radio in Orange County every afternoon at 4. He labeled replacement theology what it was: a heresy that should have no place in our churches. Replacement Theology is the view that national Israel has been &amp;ldquo;replaced&amp;rdquo; by the church and that all the promises made to the nation, most of which were unconditional, have been forfeited. This view makes God a liar. This heresy took root early on and the church has had a long history of antisemitism. The atrocities against the Jews under the banner of &amp;ldquo;Christ&amp;rdquo; sicken the stomach. Honestly, if I were a traditional Jew and knew this history, I would want nothing to do with Christianity either. This has also been a tragedy for the church as we have disconnected ourselves from the Jewishness of our faith (last time I checked, our founder was an observant Jew!) and we have also discounted the value of the Old Testament, which is over 2/3 of God&amp;rsquo;s Word that we claim to hold as inerrant. The only bad thing about my being taught to avoid this from practically day 1 of my walk with Jesus is that I was thoroughly unprepared for how pervasive this view is in the church today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point in this preface is that if you come across a definition of &amp;ldquo;Jews who are not&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;synagogue of Satan&amp;rdquo; as referring to all non-believing Jews throughout history, you need to know this interpretation is from the enemy – even if the commentator is a believing Christian with the best of intentions. The term &amp;ldquo;synagogue of Satan&amp;rdquo; has become a favorite anti-semitic slur. None other than Billy Graham used this term as an anti-semitic racial slur in a recorded conversation with President Nixon in 1972.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lizorkin elaborates: &amp;ldquo;the standard interpretation forces the reader to use later anachronistic categories while reading first-century texts,&amp;rdquo; namely Christians reading Jewish persecution into the story of Polycarp (which itself happened many decades after the letter to Smyrna), when this version of the facts is dubious at best. &amp;ldquo;History helps, but only if it is contemporaneous to John&amp;rsquo;s words.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Lizorkin and other commentators have noted antisemitic bias on the part of bible translators. In James 2:2, the word sunagogeh is used but it is rarely if ever translated as synagogue. Translators prefer &amp;ldquo;assembly&amp;rdquo; when the word is neutral or positive. In other words, &lt;em&gt;sunagogeh&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ecclesia&lt;/em&gt; mean exactly the same thing. They are synonymns. However, when sunagogeh has a negative connotation as it does here in Rev 2:9, they choose &amp;ldquo;synagogue&amp;rdquo; as it brings to mind a uniquely Jewish affiliation. As we have pointed out, the early &amp;ldquo;Christians&amp;rdquo; met in synagogues through the early second century at the earliest, possibly even longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with all of this lengthy preface, let&amp;rsquo;s come up with a non Replacement Theology position on &amp;ldquo;those who call themselves Jews but aren&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Synagogue of Satan.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to avoid antisemitism with this verse? Absolutely. All we have to do is simply follow the primary rule of Bible interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary Rule of Bible Interpretation: When the plain sense of Scripture makes common sense, seek no other sense (or you&amp;rsquo;ll end up with a pretense that is likely nonsense).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, as Dr. Fructenbaum says, &amp;ldquo;we take every word at face value unless the facts or immediate context CLEARLY indicate otherwise. A literal interpretation does not rule out figures of speech but even these have a literal background.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This is a rule that if you ask every serious Bible commentator, they will agree with it. Yet MOST of these same commentators completely throw this out the window when it comes to prophesy in general, and these two verses regarding the Jews specifically. They will concoct some scheme that it is true Jews who are not are really Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the letter to Ephesus, we had a nearly identical phrase, &amp;ldquo;those who call themselves apostles (Christians) but are not.&amp;rdquo; In that case, the meaning was seemingly obvious. These people are imposters. They claim to be Christians, but their behavior tells a different story. They are Christians in name only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the only question to ask is &amp;ldquo;what is the plain sense reading of &amp;lsquo;those who call themselves Jews but aren&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rdquo;? Answer: these are people who are NOT Jews. They are imposters, being dishonest about their affiliation. They claim to be Jews, but their behavior tells a different story. They are Jews in name only. And in this case, this group of imposters is slandering the believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was that so hard? I am baffled why commentators go to great lengths to allegorize this passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, do we already have an example &lt;em&gt;from scripture,&lt;/em&gt; of such a group of people calling themselves Jews but not acting like Jews? As a matter of fact, yes. John 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joh 8:39-44 They answered him, “Abraham is our father.” Jesus said to them, “If you were Abraham&amp;rsquo;s children, you would be doing the works Abraham did, (40) but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did. (41) You are doing the works your father did.” They said to him, “We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father—even God.” (42) Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but he sent me. (43) Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word. (44) You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father&amp;rsquo;s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we discussed in Gospel Backgrounds, Jesus is not speaking to or about all Jews in John 8. He is not even speaking to all Pharisees. He is speaking to a narrow subset of Pharisees who were involved in a plot to kill him. We can prove that not all Pharisees are implicated because there were several Pharisees who believed in Jesus - namely Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea. As an aside, there is some historical reason to believe that Jesus might not have been speaking to any Pharisees here, but general members of the Jerusalem corrupt temple establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Jews were not responsible for His crucifixion. It occurred very early in the morning on a feast day. The vast majority of Jews were at home, probably sleeping. No, this was a sly crime at the hands of very few, probably much fewer than we may realize. Tens of thousands of Jews came to faith after the Resurrection and thousands of Jews are coming to faith in Yeshua as their messiah today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it is wholly incorrect to say that the Jews who are not, refers to all Jews throughout history. We know that Rev 2:2 is not speaking about all Christians. Just as there are corrupt Christians whom we might call Christians in Name only, there were and are corrupt Jews who are &amp;ldquo;Jews in name only&amp;rdquo; but who really have Satan, the accuser as their father. Therefore, Jesus is basically saying that their father is not Abraham but Satan, and they don&amp;rsquo;t worship in a proper synagogue, but a Synagogue devoted to their father. Not necessarily one filled with satanic rituals as we might think of them, but one built on accusations, such as informing against one&amp;rsquo;s brethren to the authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Lancaster, informing and accusing one&amp;rsquo;s neighbor is expressly prohibited by the Torah. Jews who were doing this were behaving exactly like the Jews Jesus was contesting in John 8. They were not upholding the high ethical standards God expects of His followers.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Leviticus 19:18 says to love your neighbor as yourself. While Jews debated as to who their neighbor was (see the Good Samaritan parable), unquestionably fellow Jews and gentiles who worshipped alongside each other in Synagogue would have been their neighbor whom they were to love, not accuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other views that are equally plausible. Lizorkin sees fake converts trying to avoid persecution.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This view fits given Jesus&amp;rsquo; command to hold fast. This group caved and perhaps renounced Jesus, if only for show. Fructenbaum sees Rome and their anti-Messiah emperor as impersonating the one true God and His Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is not correct is to affix this label to those who really are Jewish and have done nothing to disavow that status. Also keep in mind that as of this letter, there was no separate Gentile Christian religion separate from Judaism. Jesus and Paul both make it clear that the Kingdom is for the Jew first. We gentiles are included only by God&amp;rsquo;s grace. Paul even warns us not to become proud (and our inclusion is supposed to provoke them to jealousy, not make them want to have nothing to do with us!). I encourage a careful study of Romans 9-11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;judgment-but-i-have-this-against-you-omitted-for-smyrna&#34;&gt;Judgment &amp;ldquo;But I have this against you&amp;rdquo;: OMITTED FOR SMYRNA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our lesson on the sevenfold structure, we mentioned that the standard outline for these letters has seven elements including a section on Judgment. That is the rule, but there are two exceptions. Smyrna is one of the two cities that receives no Judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep this in mind whenever we are going through a trial. We often feel as if God has abandoned us and maybe feel that we must have done something for God to judge us by sending us this trial. The letter to Smyrna corrects that thinking. Just because there is tribulation doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that it is God&amp;rsquo;s judgment. In Smyrna&amp;rsquo;s case it clearly was not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Lizorkin points out, the concept of things not truly being as they appear is a trademark of apocalyptic literature.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As we mentioned in the early lessons, a reason for God giving a revelation was to communicate that even though things seem bad on earth, God is still in control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(10) Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid of what you are about to suffer. Look, the Adversary is going to have some of you thrown in prison, in order to put you to the test; and you will face an ordeal for ten days. Remain faithful, even to the point of death; and I will give you life as your crown.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fear not&amp;rdquo; ~150x 2Ti 3:12 And indeed, all who want to live a godly life united with the Messiah Yeshua will be persecuted,   Jas 1:2-3 Regard it all as joy, my brothers, when you face various kinds of temptations; (3) for you know that the testing of your trust produces perseverance.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not fear is a major theme of Revelation. Even though things are bad, do not fear. In fact, things are going to get worse. Even though you may be unjustly thrown in jail, do not fear. Even though you may die, do not fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus reminds them that it is Satan, the accuser or the adversary who is behind all of this. We only see earthly combatants, but God shows us there is a much bigger picture spiritually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars don&amp;rsquo;t know what the &amp;ldquo;ten days&amp;rdquo; means. If we take it literally, there could have been a period of ten days where there was a wave of intense persecution. This would be something like a pogrom.  Others, particularly those who hold to the Church Age theory, see ten Roman Emperors who specifically persecuted believers.  See callout below for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;10 Roman Emperors?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proponents of the church-age theory see a list of ten Roman emperors between 50-311 who persecuted the church&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;54-68 Nero (Paul and Peter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;95-96 Domitian (John (attempted, then exiled))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;104-117 Trajan ( Ignatius)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;161-180 Marcus Aurelius (Polycarp)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200-211 Septimus Severus (Iraneus)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;235-237 Maximinus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;249-251 Decius&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;257-260 Valerian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;270-275 Aurelian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;303-311 Diocletian (worst of all!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Foxe&amp;rsquo;s book of Martyrs, it is reported that 5 million believers died for Christ during this period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The priests of the various deities in Smyrna wore a laurel (crown of leaves) in honor of their service. Jesus says His faithful will receive a crown in honor of their service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(11) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities. He who wins the victory will not be hurt at all by the second death.&amp;rdquo; &#39;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev_20:6 Blessed and holy &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years. Rev_20:14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. Rev 21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will find out more about the second death once we get to Revelation 20. There is a quip, &amp;ldquo;born once, die twice; born twice, die once.&amp;rdquo; Born again believers are spared the second death, while the unrepentant are not born again get to die once on this earth and then will be cast into the second death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;church-age-theory-persecuted-170-312&#34;&gt;Church age theory: Persecuted (170-312)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we move on to our three speculation areas: the church age theory, the Pauline letter tie in and the parable tie in. Proponents of the church age theory see Smyrna as representative of the Persecuted church from 170 to 312, as exemplified by the 10 Roman emperors with state sponsored persecution we listed earlier. This all came to an end with the edict of Toleration (Christianity decriminalized if we want to look at it that way) around 311 between Emperors Galerius and Constantine (yes there were two. There were actually three). The full legalization of Christianity occurred in 313, but that ushered in a whole new set of problems which we&amp;rsquo;ll get to when we look at the church of Pergamum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;24 Yeshua put before them another parable. &amp;ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;25 but while people were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, then went away.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;26 When the wheat sprouted and formed heads of grain, the weeds also appeared.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;27 The owner&amp;rsquo;s servants came to him and said, &amp;lsquo;Sir didn&amp;rsquo;t you sow good seed in your field? Where have the weeds come from?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;28 He answered, &amp;lsquo;An enemy has done this.&amp;rsquo; The servants asked him, &amp;lsquo;Then do you want us to go and pull them up?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;29 But he said, &amp;lsquo;No, because if you pull up the weeds, you might uproot some of the wheat at the same time.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;30 Let them both grow together until the harvest; and at harvest-time I will tell the reapers to collect the weeds first and tie them in bundles to be burned, but to gather the wheat into my barn.&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1:12-13 I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel, (13) so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1:14 And most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1:18-21 What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice, (19) for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, (20) as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. (21) For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1:27-28 Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel, (28) and not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1:29 For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;2:2 complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;2:3-4 Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. (4) Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. (speaks to the importance of being who you say you are – if say we follow God, we need to act like it).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;2:7-8 but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. (8) And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;2:15-16 that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, (16) holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. (and get your crown!)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;2:17 Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;3:7 But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;3:10-11 that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, (11) that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;3:14 I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;3:20-21 But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, (21) who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;4:4-8 Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice. (5) Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand; (6) do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. (7) And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. (8) Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;4:13 I can do all things through him who strengthens me.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Lastly, Php 4:22 states, &amp;ldquo;All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar&amp;rsquo;s household.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/dt&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Pergamum, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the one who has the sharp double-edged sword: (13) &amp;ldquo;I know where you are living, there where the Adversary&amp;rsquo;s throne is. Yet you are holding onto my name. You did not deny trusting me even at the time when my faithful witness Antipas was put to death in your town, there where the Adversary lives. (14) Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: you have some people who hold to the teaching of Bil`am, who taught Balak to set a trap for the people of Isra&amp;rsquo;el, so that they would eat food that had been sacrificed to idols and commit sexual sin. (15) Likewise, you too have people who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans. (16) Therefore, turn from these sins. Otherwise, I will come to you very soon and make war against them with the sword of my mouth. (17) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities. To him winning the victory, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give him a white stone, on which is written a new name that nobody knows except the one receiving it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pergamum (aka, Pergamon or Pergamos) is inland about 70 miles north of Smyrna. Archaeologists believe the city was founded in the third millennium BCE. The town likely owes its beginnings to geography, as there is a conspicuous hill 900 feet above the valley below. It was once thought to be impregnable. Later, Lysimachus, one of Alexander the Great&amp;rsquo;s four succeeding generals, built a military fortification on this hill called an acropolis. Lysimachus also built Ephesus, and the two cities would vie for power and favor throughout the Roman period. Ultimately Ephesus, with its harbor, became the economic power, while Pergamum became the religious center. Since religion and politics were one and the same, Pergamum became the Roman capital of Asia minor.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The second photo shows a closer look at the acropolis with labels from Dr. Bolen. Note the theater with seating for 10,000 built into the hill. It is the steepest of all Roman theaters excavated in Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The library was massive by standards of the day with 200,000 volumes, barely second to the library at Alexandria, Egypt. Stiles notes that after relations with the Romans and Egyptians soured and the empire no longer had access to papyrus, Pergamum&amp;rsquo;s people developed parchment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;emperor-worshiproman-imperial-cult&#34;&gt;Emperor Worship/Roman Imperial Cult&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/468f7c93bbb74a67b807c9a9cf792d4e.png&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 250 BCE, Bolen writes, &amp;ldquo;Pergamum became a leading cultural center, especially in art and science. The acropolis underwent a massive restoration, and the Aesculapian was founded.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Missler writes that Pergamum &amp;ldquo;became the center of the official religion of emperor worship. The first temple of this cult was erected at Pergamos in 27 BCE.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In his commentary, Missler also traces several pagan myths founded in Babylon that eventually were incorporated at Pergamum during the Greek period and eventually to Rome during the Roman period. As was common to all seven cities, numerous pagan statues, shrines, and temples were built in homage to the Roman Imperial Cult. It is also depicted on their coinage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/b43ad60e966f33f3df7bb0b269ade942.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt; As discussed previously, this put the gentile believers in a difficult position. Emperor worship was compulsory unless you were Jewish. Although not explicitly stated, we can speculate that many in Pergamum went through the motions of the emperor worship procedures (compared to Smyrna, where they did not). Jewish believers and nonbelievers were still in an uncomfortable position, of course. The Torah prohibits graven images, such as the one on this coin and the many statutes erected around the town. Many probably simply got used to it; in other words, they compromised. The genuinely devout would have continued to be bothered by it. As we discussed in the Smyrna lesson, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be beaten to feel beaten down. DeSilva notes, &amp;ldquo;Antagonism towards the Christian movement appears to have been particularly high (in Pergamum), resulting in the murder (whether as a result of official proceedings or back-alley action) of a Christian named Antipas.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This was life for the believers in the Roman empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener also notes that local rulers were first worshipped and revered in Pergamum, and emperor worship is reflected on coins. &amp;ldquo;Pergamum was one of the first cities of Asia to build a temple to a Roman emperor, making it a center of the cult.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; DeSilva notes that &amp;ldquo;the temple of Roma and Augustus in Pergamum is a manifestation of the cult of the beast and its image.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In any case, we can infer that Pergamum was exceedingly wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;altar-to-zeus&#34;&gt;Altar to Zeus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/f7f18007082f93aa77df3052250281ce.png&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeus (or Jupiter to the Romans) is believed to be the chief of the Greek gods. In Pergamum, there was a massive temple to Zeus. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In a 1st century Jewish mindset, he would be the chief of the false gods, making him equivalent to Satan. Where there is a temple to a god is where his throne is. This leads many to conclude Zeus&amp;rsquo; temple is &amp;ldquo;where Satan has his throne.&amp;rdquo; The altar is in Berlin today; although it is commonly believed that Hitler had it moved, Bolen notes that it was moved in the 19th century.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Today all that remains in Pergamum are stairs and the altar&amp;rsquo;s foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;aesculapius&#34;&gt;Aesculapius&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/10bf26ff4badeff9e089ff42369ea9c7.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aesculapius was a god who had healing and resurrection powers by using the blood of Medusa. The latter is how he came to be associated with snakes. Note the counterfeit themes of healing, resurrection, and blood. Aesculapius is almost always portrayed with a snake, Propylon, who gave him healing powers.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  As an aside, Asclepius had two noteworthy daughters, Hygia and Panacea, where we get our words hygiene and panacea today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also see the serpent imagery proudly displayed on this coin from Pergamum. As we&amp;rsquo;ve said before, we need to put ourselves in the shoes of those believers living in that time and realize how difficult life was to be a pure and undefiled believer in Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early medicine was directly associated with serpent worship. It was more superstition than science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed is the serpent symbolism, such as the modern logo of the American Medical Association, the professional organization for physicians in the United States. Many health related agencies use the serpent on a pole symbolism.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;The original serpent on a pole: Numbers 21&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/9030f3e7d0839a48c6007c8b1f3eed4d.jpg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;The serpent on a pole is likely a corruption of Numbers 21. When the Israelites in the wilderness grumbled against God and Moses, they had a lack of faith and believed they were led out in the wilderness to die. We may not utter those words, but how often is our attitude precisely like this. God wants to build us, and that can be painful at times. He&amp;rsquo;s using that two-edged sword to excise tumors in our lives. In Israel&amp;rsquo;s case, the Lord sent fiery serpents, perhaps cobras, as a curse, and many died. Those who survived prayed for relief. Here God tells Moses to do something that admittedly is very odd. Num 21:8 And the LORD said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent (out of bronze) and set it on a pole, and everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.” Moses made the serpent out of brass. In Hebrew, there is a deliberate play on words as snake/serpent and brass are linguistically connected נְחַ֣שׁ נְחֹ֔שֶׁת. Brass is a symbol of judgment, and in this case, the snakes were a judgment. IN the Garden, the snake brought judgment. Interestingly, 700 or 800 years later, this pole is still around and yet has become an item of idolatry (idolatry is the very thing Jesus has most against the assembly at Pergamum). During his religious reforms, Judean King Hezekiah, one of the good kings who &amp;ldquo;did what was right in the eyes of the LORD…smashed the bronze serpent Moses had made, for until those days the people of Israel had made offerings to it (it was called Nehushtan).&amp;rdquo; (2 Kings 18:4) Walton notes, &amp;ldquo;Nehushtan appears to have been diety of healing.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is not too much of a stretch to see that what started as a legitimate symbol of God&amp;rsquo;s healing became paganized into Asclepius.&lt;/p&gt;

Archeologists have identified around 400 of these, but the largest was in Pergamum. The Asclepion in Pergamum was a large complex with healing chambers, sacred pools for mud baths, a medical library (using the phrase loosely), and a 3500-seat theater. It was believed that a combination of Aesculapius worship, sedative or hallucinogenic drug use, and snakes (sometimes snake bites) would bring about healing. It was something like an entertainment center, late 60&amp;rsquo;s Haight-Ashbury district, hospital, a pagan temple, and spa rolled into one. Emperor Hadrian was once a patient at the Asclepium in Pergamum. Lancaster reports that patients were given a drug, then they would enter the complex by way of an 86-yard dark tunnel where they would hear voices (actually priests standing above the tunnel), then he or she would lie in a bed, and snakes would slither over the patient and speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aesclepium in Pergamum was the most famous, but there were other such centers throughout the Greco-Roman world; archeologists have identified 400 Aesclepia. Biblical scholars and archeologists believe there was such a place in Jerusalem, called the Pools of Bethesda. John 5 takes on an entirely new level of understanding once we realize this was not a place where an angel of the Lord stirred the waters.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It was a pagan and demonic healing center where Jesus proved Himself greater. See our video from &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/G6XOcfHcchQ&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gospel Backgrounds #11&lt;/a&gt; for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given Satan&amp;rsquo;s association with the serpent from Genesis 3, the Asclepion is another strong candidate for &amp;ldquo;Satan&amp;rsquo;s throne,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;new-testament-pergamum&#34;&gt;New Testament Pergamum&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation contains the only two mentions of Pergamum in the New Testament.  After the apostolic period, Bolen notes intense persecution of Christians broke out under the rule of Decius (249-251), but the Edict of Milan in 313 declared Christianity legal, and by 379, &amp;ldquo;it had become the state religion; pagan temples were converted into churches.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the present city of Bergama lies near ancient Pergamum. Bergama has a population of around 20,000, compared to ten times that many in Roman times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Pergamum, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the one who has the sharp double-edged sword:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 1:16 In his right hand, he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in full strength.  &lt;br&gt;Joh 1:17 For (just as) the law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.  &lt;br&gt;Isa 11:4 but with righteousness, he shall judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth; and he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked.  &lt;br&gt;Isa 49:2 He made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand he hid me; he made me a polished arrow; in his quiver, he hid me away.  &lt;br&gt;2 Th 2:8 And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming. &lt;br&gt; 2 Ti 3:16-17 All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, (17) that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pergamum&lt;/strong&gt; meaning: directly it means height or elevation, which given the geography fits. Indirectly, it could be related to marriage (monogamy, polygamy). In medical terms, &lt;em&gt;per&lt;/em&gt; usually means through (percutaneous, through the cutaneous layer of the skin; perforate is to tear or make a hole through). In this sense while &amp;ldquo;through marriage&amp;rdquo; Pergamum could connote a &amp;ldquo;strange or abnormal marriage&amp;rdquo;, one that is penetrated or perforated inappropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/7f2c14d943c86419e27335e4e929d7e5.png&#34; width=&#34;30%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;A literal &lt;strong&gt;sword&lt;/strong&gt; is a weapon that can be used either offensively or defensively. It protects, separates, and, if necessary, kills. In antiquity and today with Islam, the sword is synonymous with the power to execute judgment, specifically capital punishment.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Therefore, Jesus&amp;rsquo; selection of the sword image could be related to the event He&amp;rsquo;s about to recount regarding Antipas&#39; capital punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The congregation in Pergamum was in a challenging location, where &lt;strong&gt;Satan dwells&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s no accident (and in the Bible, nothing is there by accident) that Jesus has the sharp two-edged sword. They are in a spiritual battle, and the weapons need to be sharpened for use. We are in spiritual warfare too, so this letter is for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that the sword is described as sharp. So it&amp;rsquo;s not just a double-edged sword; it&amp;rsquo;s a SHARP double-edged sword. If you were a surgeon, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a very good one if you operated with a dull scalpel. In the Bible, the sword is a well-established metaphor for the word of God. How sharp is your sword? When we read the letter to Ephesus, we looked at the armor of God passage in Ephesians 6. There is one crucial point to make, and it relates to having a sharp sword. The time to get fitted for the armor is before the battle. If you wait until you&amp;rsquo;re already in the middle of a fight, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to say it&amp;rsquo;s too late because better late than never; but doing it before the battle is the way to go. In the same way, you make sure your sword is sharpened before you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Christians believe that the double-edges refer to the Old and New Testaments, but we must remember that there was no New Testament in John&amp;rsquo;s day. The beginnings of a New Testament are still well over 100 years away. More precisely, it is the Law of Moses and the grace/Gospel of Jesus, as we see in John 1:17. Note that if your translation has a &amp;ldquo;but&amp;rdquo; after Moses, that word is not in the original, completely changing the meaning. Remove it from your thinking. Law, grace, and truth are not opposites. You can&amp;rsquo;t have grace and truth unless you have a standard of reference, which is the law. The opposite of law is lawlessness, as we see in 2 Thessalonians 2:8. The opposite of the Torah is to be without the Torah, i.e., without teaching the Scriptures. The opposite of grace is disgrace. As we see in Revelation 1:16 and 2:12, law and grace are two sides of the same sword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should always remember 2Ti 3:16-17: &amp;ldquo;All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, (17) that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luke 21:17 You will be hated by all for my name&amp;rsquo;s sake.  &lt;br&gt;Jude 1:4 For certain people have crept in unnoticed who long ago were designated for this condemnation, ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.  &lt;br&gt;2 Ti 2:12 if we endure, we will also reign with him; if we deny him, he also will deny us;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t know precisely what Jesus was referring to when He said &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Satan&amp;rsquo;s throne&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo; The worship of the Emperors, Zeus, and Aesculapius would each be viable candidates.  He could also have been referring to Pergamum in general, as a city that was the epicenter of false religion (second only to Rome in that regard).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;&amp;lsquo;The Unseen Realm&amp;rsquo;: Are Satan and the serpent one and the same?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Heiser&amp;rsquo;s book, The Unseen Realm, has a fascinating discussion on the distinction between the devil/serpent of Genesis 3 and &amp;ldquo;the Satan&amp;rdquo; of, say, Job 1. Heiser describes that in the earliest Jewish writings, &amp;ldquo;the Satan described in (Job 1) is not the devil. Rather he&amp;rsquo;s an anonymous prosecutor fulfilling a role in God&amp;rsquo;s council.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In other words, it appears the Satan&amp;rsquo;s (the accuser&amp;rsquo;s) role was to serve at God&amp;rsquo;s pleasure to test (in the sense of purifying) God&amp;rsquo;s people. Later, Jewish writings began to conflate the devil and the Satan. &amp;ldquo;The dark figure of Genesis 3 was eventually thought of as the &amp;lsquo;mother of all adversaries,&amp;rsquo; and so the label &lt;em&gt;satan&lt;/em&gt; got stuck to him. He deserves it.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heiser&amp;rsquo;s book is a scholarly yet most readable examination of the supernatural realm, with which most Christians are not familiar. It fits with a study of Revelation, and I highly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people&amp;rsquo;s first instinct would be to get away from such a city. It&amp;rsquo;s natural to want to be safe and comfortable, but we as believers have a different calling. Jesus said He came to seek the lost, and His instructions to us are to make talmidim disciples from all nations. A modern example might be Las Vegas. Many believers say they have no desire to go there. Suppose the purpose is not to participate in the sinful entertainment economy; that&amp;rsquo;s fine and wise in many cases. But if we think that God doesn&amp;rsquo;t or can&amp;rsquo;t love the people in that city caught up in sin, we are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminded me of a story. I grew up in a suburb of Los Angeles, and in the mid-70s, a former Los Angeles Dodger named Maury Wills came to speak at my elementary school. He played shortstop. He said there were two kinds of ballplayers. Those who said, &amp;ldquo;please, I hope he doesn&amp;rsquo;t hit the ball to me,&amp;rdquo; and those who said, &amp;ldquo;hit the ball to me. Hit the ball to me.&amp;rdquo; What type of Christian are you? What type am I? It&amp;rsquo;s natural to want things to be safe and comfortable, but the Bible nowhere promises this. Some of us need to first get in the game. Then once we are there, we need to say, &amp;ldquo;God, hit the ball to me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holding on to His name&lt;/strong&gt; does not mean they merely claimed to be Christians. As we&amp;rsquo;ve studied, the meaning of an English word such as &amp;ldquo;name&amp;rdquo; might be abstract, and the underlying Hebrew thought generally implies action. The word for name means one&amp;rsquo;s character and reputation. If we hold fast to His name, we aren&amp;rsquo;t just paying lip service. We are positively representing Him by our conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t know who &lt;strong&gt;Antipas&lt;/strong&gt; was except to say that was a prevalent name. Herod Antipas was the Herod who beheaded John the Baptist (Mar 6:22), hunted Jesus during His earthly ministry (Luke 13:31), and mocked Jesus at one of His trials (Luke 23:11), so obviously, this is a different Antipas. Church tradition holds that John appointed Antipas as bishop over Pergamum and that he healed people and expelled demons. He was put to death because he threatened the Asclepius cultic and economic system. As he was dying, he reportedly said, &amp;ldquo;your faith in gods is a false one.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The legend fits almost a little too perfectly with Pergamum, so we can&amp;rsquo;t discount the fact that some liberties might have been taken with the historical Antipas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(14) Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: you have some people who hold to the teaching of Bil`am, who taught Balak to set a trap for the people of Isra&amp;rsquo;el, so that they would eat food that had been sacrificed to idols and commit sexual sin. (15) Likewise, you too have people who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Numbers 22-25, 31 &lt;br&gt;Joshua 13:22 Balaam also, the son of Beor, the one who practiced divination, was killed with the sword by the people of Israel &lt;br&gt;2 Pe 2:15 Forsaking the right way, they have gone astray. They have followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved gain from wrongdoing,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This letter gets our attention since Smyrna had zero things against and Ephesus had only one. When Jesus says, &amp;ldquo;I have &lt;strong&gt;a few things&lt;/strong&gt; against you,&amp;rdquo; it&amp;rsquo;s time to buckle up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;sexual immorality&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; as used in Rev 2:14 is most certainly literal, the Old Testament frequently sees idolatry as spiritual infidelity against God. It&amp;rsquo;s beyond our scope to give this the treatment it deserves, but many scholars see the Torah as a contact, specifically a marriage contract between God and His people (just as believers in Messiah are referred to as His Bride). Breaking that contract to follow another god is the same as breaking one&amp;rsquo;s wedding vows by sexual sin. Likely both are in view here at Pergamum. People claiming to be believers and followers of Jesus, his Bride, are &amp;ldquo;whoring&amp;rdquo; after the Roman gods, if for no other reason than to fit in with the rest of the society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the many cryptic references in these letters (and we assume they were not cryptic to the original audience), we know precisely what Jesus meant when He referred to &lt;strong&gt;Balaam and Balak&lt;/strong&gt;. The story spans Numbers 22-25, with a post-script in Numbers 31. Interestingly, this story immediately follows the episode of the bronze serpent (Num 21:4-9). Perhaps Jesus&#39; audience (at least the Jewish members) would have realized the connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, Balak was the king of the Moabites. Ammon and Moab were sons of Lot via incestual relations with his daughters. In other words, the Moabites were related to the grand-nephew of Abraham, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly get off to a stellar beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The territorial land of Moab is in the southern section of modern Jordan today. The Moabites and Israelites became foes when Israel asked to pass through Moab on their way to the Promised Land but were refused (a shocking violation of the usually obligatory middle eastern hospitality). In the photo, the Israelites were asking to pass through the land where the &amp;ldquo;Moab&amp;rdquo; label is. Balak feared a military incursion, but the Israelites genuinely only needed to use the well-traveled Kings Highway to reach a point to cross the Jordan and enter their land. Balak hired a well-known prophet named Balaam to curse the Israelites. He would be reimbursed for his troubles. Balaam, who appears to have had some sort of genuine line of communication with Adonai, the God of the Israelites, agreed, leading to his description as a &amp;ldquo;prophet for hire&amp;rdquo; or, as I like to say, &amp;ldquo;the for-profit prophet.&amp;rdquo; Repeatedly, as Balaam went to curse Israel, God intervened, and he was unable. This led Balak to think that maybe Balaam had been outbid by the Israelites to bless instead of curse. Balak offered an even sweeter compensation package, to which Balaam naturally agreed. This led to a literal &amp;ldquo;come to Jesus&amp;rdquo; meeting between Balaam, and the angel of the LORD, whom most Christians would say is a pre-incarnate appearance of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balaam&amp;rsquo;s donkey sees Jesus before Balaam does in a rather humorous episode. When the donkey stopped, Balaam kicked her and struck her. Then the donkey said, &amp;lsquo;what have I done to you that you have struck me these three times?&amp;rsquo; Not impressed that his donkey talked, he answered &amp;lsquo;because you have made a fool of me. I wish I had a sword in my hand, then I would kill you.&amp;rsquo; … Then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the lord with His drawn sword.&amp;quot; Despite explaining to Balak the situation, Balaam did what a lot of us do when we get an answer we don&amp;rsquo;t like from God. We keep asking. In the end, Balaam could do none other than blessing Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 24 ends with Balaam and Balak going their separate ways and a casual reading might lead us to believe that all of these shenanigans came to nothing. Chapter 25 begins with a seemingly unrelated episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Num 25:1-3 While Israel lived in Shittim, the people began to whore with the daughters of Moab. (2) These invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods. (3) So Israel yoked himself to Baal of Peor. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the episode Jesus references in Revelation 2:14 about eating food sacrificed to idols and practicing sexual immorality. As an aside, Numbers 25:4 and following describes what is known as the &amp;ldquo;zeal of Phinehas&amp;rdquo; who slew both the men of Israel and the Moabite women, thus stopping the plague that ultimately killed 24,000. This was no minor plague. This is where the term Zealots originated from as used in the New Testament. The Zealots were a group that agitated for the violent overthrow of Rome. Despite Jesus not aligning with this philosophy, many zealots aligned with Jesus thinking He might be a means to the end they wanted to achieve. Because of the number of people following Jesus, the Jewish and Roman authorities constantly feared a riot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then don&amp;rsquo;t read anything about Balaam until he is killed in a raid in Numbers 31:8. The Holy Spirit wanted us to know that Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba were killed, &amp;ldquo;and they also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword.&amp;rdquo; There is an exciting sword theme running through this section, isn&amp;rsquo;t there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t find out until Numbers 31:16 connects-the-dots for us that the episode in chapter 25 happened because Balaam told Balak how he could bring a curse upon Israel. If Moab made their pretty young ladies available to the Israelite men, the men wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to resist. Note that God didn&amp;rsquo;t directly curse the Moabites. After all, we could say they were acting like Moabites (which is why the book of Ruth the Moabitess is so astounding and a powerful picture of a gentile coming to faith in Israel&amp;rsquo;s God). God cursed the Israelites who were not acting the way Israelites should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what excuses they made. &amp;ldquo;just this once.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;no one will know.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Everybody&amp;rsquo;s doing it.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;God wants me to be happy.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I have freedom in Christ.&amp;rdquo; Ok maybe the Israelites didn&amp;rsquo;t use that last one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that is the story of Balaam and Balak. What Satan can&amp;rsquo;t accomplish externally through force and persecution, he can often achieve from within by leveraging the corruptible natures of the believers. If we are in Christ we are saved from the penalty of sin but, as long as we are alive on this earth and until He comes again, we must continually work to deal with the power of sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2nd Peter 2:15 tells us those who follow the way of Balaam love gain from wrongdoing. All of 2nd Peter chapter 2 is worth reading for additional context, but key verses would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Pe 2:1-3 But false prophets also arose among the people, &lt;strong&gt;just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them&lt;/strong&gt;, bringing upon themselves swift destruction. (2) And many will follow their sensuality, and the way of truth will be blasphemed because of them. (3) And in their greed, they will exploit you with false words. Their condemnation from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Pe 2:12-15 But these, like irrational animals, creatures of instinct, born to be caught and destroyed, blaspheming about matters of which they are ignorant, will also be destroyed in their destruction, (13) suffering wrong as the wage for their wrongdoing. They count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions, while they feast with you. (14) They have eyes full of adultery, insatiable for sin. They entice unsteady souls. They have hearts trained in greed. Accursed children! (15) Forsaking the right way, they have gone astray. &lt;strong&gt;They have followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved gain from wrongdoing&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Pe 2:19-21 They promise them freedom, but they are slaves of corruption. For whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved. (20) For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and &lt;strong&gt;overcome&lt;/strong&gt;, the last state has become worse for them than the first. (21) For &lt;strong&gt;it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are contemptuous words to be sure. If we don&amp;rsquo;t read carefully, it would be easy to think that verses 12-15 are talking about pagans.  However, verses 1 and 21 are clear. These people are &lt;strong&gt;PROFESSING BELIEVERS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These false teachers had slipped into the congregation(s) at Pergamum. Keener believes these false teachers &amp;ldquo;may be advocating compromise with the imperial cult&amp;hellip;and may have used their prophecies to commend themselves to elements of pagan universalism.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve already examined the Nicolaitans in the letter to Ephesus, but note Ephesus resisted while Pergamum tolerated. Jesus seems to equate whatever the Nicolaitans were doing with the sexual and dietary sins in the Balaam incident, which is why I believe the Nicholas (unrestrained sexual perversion no matter what the Bible says) or &amp;ldquo;Nochal&amp;rdquo; (we will eat all no matter what the Bible says), theories fit the context better &amp;ldquo;conquerors of the laity&amp;rdquo; theory for who the Nicolaitans were. To put it another way, the Nicolaitans used the same strategy to undermine the congregation at Pergamum that Balaam and Balak used to undermine Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the people to whom Jesus is directing verse 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-216-repent&#34;&gt;Rev 2:16 &amp;ldquo;Repent!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Revelation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(16) Therefore, turn from these sins. Otherwise, I will come to you very soon and make war against them with the sword of my mouth.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rev 19:15 And out of his mouth comes to a sharp sword with which to strike down nations—&amp;ldquo;He will rule them with a staff of iron.&amp;rdquo; It is he who treads the winepress from which flows the wine of the furious rage of Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies.  &lt;br&gt;Rev 19:21 The rest were killed with the sword that goes out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the Balaam references, the sword imagery is conspicuous (Num 22:23, 29, 31; 31:8, Joshua 13:22). In effect, Jesus is saying if the people are going to act like Balaam, they will meet with a similar ending. Jesus isn&amp;rsquo;t wielding a literal sword; He doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to. His literal words are plenty powerful. Also, there is the just punishment recorded in the Torah for those who follow in the way and the teaching of Balaam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we are starting to see the connection Jesus is building. When we take a more expansive view, the two judgments for the unrepentant (Ephesus and Pergamum) would seem to involve a forfeiture of eternal life. At Ephesus, Jesus said He would remove the menorah from its place. Since Jesus is in the midst of the menorah, he is talking about removing the unrepentant from His presence. Here, the unrepentant will receive the sword of judgment, which we can see fulfilled in Revelation 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the same lines, all the promises to the overcomers involve gaining eternal life. Ephesus would get to eat from the Tree of Life, Smyrna will be exempted from the second death, and below, Pergamum will eat of the &amp;ldquo;hidden manna.&amp;rdquo; We&amp;rsquo;ll describe the connection to eternal life in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the overcomers get to do these things, then we can logically assume that non-overcomers, the unsaved, do NOT get to do these things. Also, the Tree of Life was literal. The manna in the wilderness was literal food. We can assume the second death is also literal. In other words, Jesus is not merely speaking symbolically that believers will go to heaven and the unbelievers will go to hell. There is much more involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pergamum-gets-no-secondary-encouragement&#34;&gt;Pergamum gets no secondary encouragement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical letter has a judgment sandwiched between two separate words of praise and encouragement; a &amp;ldquo;praise sandwich&amp;rdquo; if you will.  Right here is the point where we would expect the secondary encouragement (e.g., &amp;ldquo;but you have those &lt;who are doing something good&gt;&amp;quot;).  This is absent for Pergamum.   Pergamum&amp;rsquo;s letter is open-faced, not a sandwich. An open faced sandwich is good if you&amp;rsquo;re trying to cut back on carbs, but not so good if you want to do good deeds that please your Master. Pergamum receives a praise and a judgment, but no closing secondary praise or encouragement. SO we get a clue that while the situation is not quite as dire as with Sardis and Laodicea, who get no praise, we do get the sense that something is fundamentally wrong with Pergamum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-217-promise-to-the-overcomer--ears&#34;&gt;Rev 2:17: Promise to the Overcomer / Ears&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;th&gt;Revelation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(17) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities. To him winning the victory, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give him a white stone, on which is written a new name that nobody knows except the one receiving it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Exo 16:31-35 Now the house of Israel called its name manna. It was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. (32) Moses said, “This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations, so that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’” (33) And Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar, and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the LORD to be kept throughout your generations.” (34) As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the testimony to be kept. (35) The people of Israel ate the manna forty years, till they came to a habitable land. They ate the manna till they came to the border of the land of Canaan. &lt;br&gt;Joh 6:31 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the scholars I read describe some plausible conjectures but ultimately are forced to throw up their hands. There is a Jewish tradition regarding the hidden manna that both Keener and Lancaster note in their comments. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at each of these three elements as best we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;hidden-manna&#34;&gt;Hidden manna&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, I would refer anyone interested in unpacking this to review Craig Keener&amp;rsquo;s notes in the IVP Bible Background Commentary, New Testament, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bethimmanuel.org/audio/hidden-manna-and-white-stone&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Daniel Lancaster&amp;rsquo;s audio teaching&lt;/a&gt;. In summary, when God provided manna from heaven for the people to eat during the wilderness wanderings, he also instructed Aaron to take an omer of the manna (about two quarts) and keep it before Adonai. See Ex 16:31-36. After the Ark of the covenant was built, it was placed inside, with Aaron&amp;rsquo;s rod that budded in front of Pharoah and the copy of the 10 Commandments. As has been popularized by a very famous movie, the Ark seemingly vanished without a trace around the Babylonian conquest of 586 BCE. This has led to several speculations and traditions about where the ark and its contents might be. A Jewish tradition holds that Elijah will present the jar of the hidden manna to the Messiah at the start of the millennial kingdom.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Keener doesn&amp;rsquo;t go to this detail, but he notes that the pot of hidden manna will &amp;ldquo;be restored at the end time.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Lancaster is confident that Jesus is confirming this legend. In his view, it would have been impossible for Jesus&#39; first-century audience to have interpreted the phrase &amp;ldquo;hidden manna&amp;rdquo; as anything other than this legend.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the connection to the millennial kingdom, it is another way of saying those who get to partake of the hidden manna will receive eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is Jesus going to feed everyone from just one omer of manna? Apparently, another feeding miracle is still to come; only this time, it will hopefully be much more than 5000! Lastly, don&amp;rsquo;t miss the fact that the letters to Ephesus and Pergamum both mention the Nicolaitans, and both mention that the overcomers would eat clean and proper food. This may or may not be significant, but I think it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;white-stone&#34;&gt;White stone&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/cf5f12d5721fb19bdee09cb7ce67f7ae.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photo is a white stone with an inscription. It&amp;rsquo;s located in Pergamum, which calls to mind Revelation 2:17&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most commentators believe this was some kind of judicial procedure where a white stone signifies one is innocent and a black stone means one is guilty. Others said it was a type of admission ticket. So here, Jesus is simultaneously proclaiming the overcomers as innocent, which grants them admittance to the Messianic Banquet. Lizorkin speculates that of the twelve stones on the High Priests robe, the white one represented the tribe of Zebulun. Zebulun&amp;rsquo;s tribal allotment was Galilee of the nations, leading to the famous passage in Isaiah 9:1-7 about a child being born and a son given.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So the secret white stone could be the Messiah himself. For sure, these speculations may fit varying degrees, but as we will see later in our study, just because something fits doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that&amp;rsquo;s what God was communicating. I like the way the Believer&amp;rsquo;s Bible Commentary concluded their discussion. After listing all of the usual theories, &amp;ldquo;it seems clear that it is a reward given by the Lord to the overcomer and expressing individual approval by Him.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; That, my friends, is about all we can be sure of!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Civic pride and the Imperial Cult&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many visitors to Pergamum note the photo above and the inscription on a white stone. This recalls Jesus&#39; words. This photo above is a dedication to the town&amp;rsquo;s ancient gymnasium honoring the facility&amp;rsquo;s director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We mentioned in the Ephesus lesson that Ephesus and Pergamum had a bit of a rivalry. I grew up in Los Angeles, so that I can compare it to the LA San Francisco rivalry. Maybe New York and Boston is another example. The Romans would award a neokoros, which essentially means &amp;ldquo;temple warden.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s sort of like being selected to host the Olympics today. It was an honor and a big deal for that city. We mentioned earlier that Pergamum was the first to be named neokoros for its consecration and worship of Augustus. Later Smyrna and Ephesus would also gain that title for their temples. deSilva notes that Ephesus began to flaunt its recent title, which upset Pergamum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inscription on this stone says Pergamum was the FIRST to be awarded neokoros. Then when Pergamum received the honor of the temple to Trajan (after Revelation was written), they paraded the title &amp;ldquo;twice awarded neokoros.&amp;rdquo; Then after Ephesus won a second neokoros, Pergamos was then &amp;ldquo;first to be twice awarded.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may seem like a silly and fun rivalry, but DeSilva notes it ran much deeper. This demonstrates &amp;ldquo;how strong were the connections between civic pride and support for the imperial cult…at the very time that Christian witness against the legitimacy of (the)cult and resistance to participation was becoming sharper.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-new-name-that-nobody-knows&#34;&gt;A new name that nobody knows&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster and other commentators pointed out that the &amp;ldquo;new name&amp;rdquo; is the more important of the two. When God changed a name in the Old Testament, it indicated His approval and acceptance, and a promise usually accompanied it. As we mentioned above, a term in Hebraic thought denotes one&amp;rsquo;s character and, in some respects, one&amp;rsquo;s destiny. Review Genesis 49 and Jacob&amp;rsquo;s prophecies to the 12 tribes. He frequently invokes a translation of the son&amp;rsquo;s name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, note that this is the third and final letter where the promise to the overcomer occurs after the &amp;ldquo;those who have ears&amp;rdquo; statement. For the last four letters, the order will be reversed. We can speculate, but we are not told why this is. The more important aspect is remembering the Hebrew meaning of shamah and hearing. It means not just listening (or reading) but understanding and obeying what Jesus has to say. In fact, it is through obedience that we become overcomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The believers in Pergamum didn&amp;rsquo;t directly deny their Lord, which is to their credit, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t do the opposite either. They worshipped other gods alongside the One True God. Lizorkin writes of Pergamum, &amp;ldquo;only one God can be worshipped and adored,&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:21&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or as Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;no one can serve two masters.&amp;rdquo; Just like the rich young ruler, we must make a choice. In our day, Satan likes to trick us, believers, into thinking that we aren&amp;rsquo;t worshipping whatever it is we actually are worshipping (the sports team, the car, the job, or the toys or websites that captivate our attention; or the doctors and the medicines that supposedly heal us and save us from sickness). After all, it&amp;rsquo;s not like we&amp;rsquo;re bowing down to them or holding them up in the air while praying to Baal, Aesculepius, or some other god. Keep in mind the thing we worship doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have to be sinful. In our economy, a job is necessary. But when one becomes married to their job, it becomes an idol. We need a car to get from place to place. But when we use a vehicle to communicate our status, it becomes a problem. There is nothing inherently wrong with money. Money is not the root of all evil. That is a misquote. The Bible says, &amp;ldquo;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.&amp;rdquo; Stiles notes, &amp;ldquo;today there is a false god for anything and everything, and they offer immediate satisfaction. But they are not the truth.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:22&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In contrast, Jesus doesn&amp;rsquo;t always offer immediate satisfaction. He requires trust, faith, and obedience. With the constant references in these letters to our being rewarded in the afterlife, believers must be willing to exchange a comfortable, instant gratification life today for the promise of not just greater, but the most significant rewards later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this in mind, think about where you and I are worshiping other gods alongside God?. Where are you (and I) married to the world? These are questions each of us must wrestle with and ask God to expose any areas where we need correction. As we said in a previous lesson, ask God to audit the books of your life. Each letter ends with &amp;ldquo;he who has an ear let him hear….&amp;rdquo; These letters are written for us today to examine ourselves and correct where needed so we can walk in faithful obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;church-age-theory&#34;&gt;Church age theory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/8553f6efbb2e3162debd77254735c497.png&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of the church age theory see Pergamum as representative of the State church, married to the world&amp;rsquo;s system of idolatry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In history, this started in 311, with the &amp;ldquo;Edict of Toleration,&amp;rdquo; which decriminalized Christianity and ended the official Roman persecution. Later Constantine would officially recognize Christianity, with the emperor himself &amp;ldquo;converting&amp;rdquo; to Christianity and legalizing Christianity in 313 with the Edict of Milan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are right to question the genuineness of his conversion, with skeptics viewing it as a pragmatic move to unify the people. In 285, Emperor Diocletian believed the Roman empire was getting too large. Hence, he not only divided it between east and west, each region would also have co-regents to help with administrative tasks. The senior administrator held Augustus&amp;rsquo;s title, while the junior administrator was titled, Caesar. There were four emperors, called a Tetrarchy. As Cargill rhetorically asked his class, &amp;ldquo;how many of you think this is going to work well?&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:23&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:23&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s like a family arrangement that starts as a good idea. When someone dies, and there are issues of succession and inheritance (and ego), it turns into a mess. This is exactly what happened. Constantine was the son of Constantius, who was the Caesar of the western half. He wanted it all and ultimately went to war with Maxentius, his counterpart in the East. Missler writes, &amp;ldquo;in 312 A.D: Constantine set out to defeat the forces of Maxentius, his rival, for supreme power in the empire. It is said that on the next day he saw a shining cross (or a &amp;ldquo;chi-rho&amp;rdquo;) in the sky with an inscription above it: &lt;em&gt;in hoc signo vinces:&lt;/em&gt; “In this sign, thou shalt conquer.” He defeated Maxentius at the Milvian bridge and immediately declared his conversion to Christianity.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:24&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:24&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus&#39; pacifist message of &amp;ldquo;turn the other cheek&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;My kingdom is not of this earth&amp;rdquo; was now replaced by a conquering Christian army who will now maim and kill in the name of Jesus. Keep this in mind when we get to the parable of the Mustard seed becoming something it was never intended to be in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, what was once a wholly Jewish faith, first called &amp;ldquo;the way&amp;rdquo; (דֶרֶך in Hebrew) is now being infiltrated by Greco-Roman philosophy to the point where it was now not only unrecognizable and incompatible with the Judaism Jesus taught, but many different gentile Christian splinter groups formed that were largely incompatible with each other. For example, groups debated the nature of Jesus and His relationship to the father. Some held he was a spirit being only (which has its roots in Gnosticism). Others held He was fully man and was only later adopted by God. Nearly everyone didn&amp;rsquo;t like the fact that He was Jewish. We can imagine the debate and infighting. This was often along geographic lines between those in the eastern and western parts of the empire, and these divisions are still around today. Constantine, pragmatically, saw an opportunity to unify the empire by bringing all these groups together to define Christian orthodoxy. In 324 was the Council of Nicaea, which resulted in the Nicene Creed and the doctrine of the Trinity. We can argue that the Creed is a good thing, but we can&amp;rsquo;t discount the fallout. Those who didn&amp;rsquo;t believe exactly the way the Council decided were now no longer Christians. This included Jewish believers. They were heretics, and heretics are burned at the stake. Ironically today, we have just as many if not more divisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Missler says, &amp;ldquo;The underground Christians exchanged the rags of oppression for the silks of the court.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:25&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:25&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few decades later, Theodosius made Christianity the official state religion of the Roman Empire. It was now not only the &amp;ldquo;in thing&amp;rdquo; to be a Christian, it was required. This led to many otherwise unregenerate people getting baptized. On that note, infant baptism was instituted, and now one was a Christian from birth no matter how they lived. Christianity didn&amp;rsquo;t immediately replace the Roman Imperial cult but existed alongside it. So the pagan practices of eating food sacrificed to idols and sexual immorality co-existed along with Christian traditions. Think of the pagan temple as a corner convenience store that now has a sign &amp;ldquo;under new management.&amp;rdquo; There may be some cosmetic changes, but it&amp;rsquo;s still the same convenience store. Temples were now Christian churches, and the pagan priests were now &amp;ldquo;Christian&amp;rdquo; priests. Pagan festivals such as spring fertility and winter solstice (longest night) were morphed into Easter and Christmas. As Missler says, &amp;ldquo;The underground Christians exchanged the rags of oppression for the silks of the court.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:25&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:25&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might be surprised how many practices from this time are still around today. Interestingly, it was the Jewish Christians who spoke out against this. For this, they now became the persecuted ones. Saturday worship was forbidden; Resurrection Sunday, instead of being the Jewish feast of Firstfruits, was intentionally disassociated from Passover (which remains today). Eating ham on Easter Sunday was instituted to isolate Jewish believers further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler points out that during this period is when symbolic and allegoric interpretations of scripture came to the forefront. In some respects, this might make sense. Jerusalem has been destroyed, which was predicted by Jesus, who often said that His kingdom was not of this world. There was also an ulterior motive by those in charge. In other words, the world&amp;rsquo;s corrupt rulers couldn&amp;rsquo;t edit out the part of the Bible that said Jesus is coming back to rid the world of its corrupt rulers. This was when the amillennial interpretation of the end times was popularized. Jesus is not coming again physically; He will rule in our hearts. This is a remnant of Gnostic philosophy that held that the physical is bad—only the spiritual matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another significant difference between the amillennial and those who hold a millennial worldview is the mission and destiny of the church. Amillennialists believe the church will grow and grow by political might to become an unstoppable force for good. Things will get better and better until, eventually, we will achieve Eden once again. The millennial kingdom is just another way of saying the church. Those who believe in a literal millennial kingdom would read the Bible that Satan oversees this world. The church is here to spread the Gospel, make disciples, and be a light in a dark world. Ultimately the world goes from bad to worse until Jesus intervenes. One group says it gets better and better, and the other group says it goes from bad to worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cargill sums up this period by saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Constantine is responsible for much of what we know as modern Christianity, for better and for worse.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:26&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:26&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;parables-pergamum--mustard-seed-mat-1324-30&#34;&gt;Parables: Pergamum = Mustard Seed (Mat 13:24-30)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
Mat 13:31 Yeshua put before them another parable. &#34;The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed which a man takes and sows in his field.
&lt;br&gt;Mat 13:32 It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it grows up, it is more significant than any garden plant and becomes a tree, so that the birds flying about come and nest in its branches.&#34;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garden plant:
:What the ecclesia should be according to Jesus. Typically, a mustard plant is a bush only a few feet high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tree:
:Many Christians see this as the church as growing and growing in greatness. In the context of something that should only be the size of a garden plant, having this grow into a tree represents a monstrosity. The thing has grown into something it was never intended to become. A compromised and carnal church that tolerates pagan practices of idolatry and sexual immorality and has made Christianity something Jesus never taught or intended it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birds of the air:
:Ministers of Satan (Matthew 13:19). The &amp;ldquo;birds of the air&amp;rdquo; from the first parable are ministers of Satan; it would be most unusual if Jesus changed the symbolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nest in its branches:
:The ministers of Satan set up shop, became this church&amp;rsquo;s leaders, and led the people astray just like Balaam/Balak did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning
:The suggestion is that what started small and was supposed to be a plant has become a monstrosity. It has become something it was never intended to be. It is so large that ministers can not just land but make nests, i.e., make a home, in its branches.
:Jesus said to carry a weapon for defense only, and even this was unusual. When He was arrested, He told the disciples to put their swords down. For all intents and purposes, Jesus&#39; earthly ministry was a model of pacifism.
:Now with the advent of Constantine, we see the church as a conqueror, both politically and militarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;paul-pergamumcorinthians&#34;&gt;Paul: Pergamum=Corinthians&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler sees the Pauline tie-in for Pergamum as the letters to the Corinthians.  1st Corinthians in particular deals with the carnal church, as exemplified by 1 Cor 5:1.  Below are a few verses to illustrate similar issues happening in both Corinth and Pergamum.  We recommend a thorough study of 1/2 Corinthians in conjunction with our study of Pergamum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Co 2:12 Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Co 3:1-3 But I, brothers, could not address you as spiritual people, but as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ. (2) I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not ready for it. And even now you are not yet ready, (3) for you are still of the flesh. For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh and behaving only in a human way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Co 3:4 For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not being merely human? (&lt;em&gt;Greek culture divinized human heroes into gods.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Co 3:16-17 Do you not know that you are God&amp;rsquo;s temple and that God&amp;rsquo;s Spirit dwells in you? (17) If anyone destroys God&amp;rsquo;s temple, God will destroy him. For God&amp;rsquo;s temple is holy, and you are that temple. (&lt;em&gt;This correlates to the dietary and fleshly fornication happening at Pergamum.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1Co 4:2 Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1Co 4:5 Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive his commendation from God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1Co 5:1 It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, for a man has his father&amp;rsquo;s wife. (&lt;em&gt;Chapter 5 is all about sexual immorality.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1Co 5:11 But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler—not even to eat with such a one. (&lt;em&gt;Paul sounds awfully judgmental here.  Are we sure the Paul of the New Testament is the same Paul we have been taught?&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1Co 6:12-13 “All things are lawful for me,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful for me,” but I will not be dominated by anything. 13 “Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food”—and God will destroy both one and the other. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. (&lt;em&gt;The ESV does an excellent job of setting off the quotes. Paul is not saying these directly. He is quoting the arguments of his opponents. Read this carefully. Just as Paul is not saying sexual fornication is lawful (God forbid!), he neither is saying all food is OK. Could &amp;ldquo;we eat all because all things are permissible&amp;rdquo; be a teaching of the Nicolaitans we have all fallen for? Asking for a friend!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

We can also see the serpent imagery proudly displayed on this coin from Pergamum. As we&amp;rsquo;ve said before, we need to put ourselves in the shoes of those believers living in that time and realize how difficult life was to be a pure and undefiled believer in Yeshua.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
