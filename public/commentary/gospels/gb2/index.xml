      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In IMMERSION AND TEMPTATION, we briefly return to &lt;strong&gt;Nazareth&lt;/strong&gt;. More than two decades have elapsed since we last visited. Yeshua is no longer a precocious twelve-year-old boy; he is a grown man who has taken over His father Joseph’s carpenter trade. From Nazareth, we follow Yeshua’s family to the plains of the &lt;strong&gt;Jordan&lt;/strong&gt;, across from Jericho, where John the Immerser is at work, proclaiming the good news and immersing for repentance&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. After His immersion, we follow Yeshua out into the dry and waterless &lt;strong&gt;Judean&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Wilderness&lt;/strong&gt; between &lt;strong&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jericho&lt;/strong&gt; where He spends forty days in prayer and fasting, concluding with His three temptations.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passages&lt;/strong&gt;: Matthew 3:13-4:11 (Mark 1:9-13, Luke 3:21-23, 4:1-13; John 1:29-34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:90%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This map&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; traces Jesus’ early ministry, including leaving Nazareth to be baptized by John (Mark 1:9) leading to His baptism in the Jordan (box 1), followed by His temptation in the Judean wilderness (box 2). We don’t know exactly where (or when) Jesus was baptized. Because of a few references, including the apparent proximity to Jerusalem (Mark 1:5) and the reference to “these stones” in the Luke and Matthew accounts suggest opposite Jericho near (or quite probably at) the location where Joshua led the Israelites across in Joshua 4. This site is marked by a traditional holy site today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not disputing a southern location for Jesus’ baptism, some scholars, including William Schlegel the publisher of this map, contend “Bethany beyond the Jordan” is not located across from Jericho but much further north in the Golan Heights (marked by box 3 on the map). They point out that it does not say that Jesus was baptized at Bethany; but in John’s gospel, it appears as if John is recollecting Jesus’ baptism which occurred at least 40 days earlier and in a different location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aubrey Taylor has noted that in the same region where Moses commissioned Joshua, and Elijah commissioned Elisha, Jesus receives a similar commission from John.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:75%&#34; alt=&#34;J:\Bethany\Matson15k1\Jordan River\Jordan River, mat23194.jpg&#34; /&gt;

The photo on the bottom&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is the same area today. The most significant issue in that part of the world, since ancient times and continues today is water rights. Before 1948 the area was sparsely populated. After 1948 with the founding of both the modern states of Israel as well as Jordan, the area began to grow, and all those new people needed food and food requires water from the Jordan river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-baptized-by-john-in-the-jordan&#34;&gt;Jesus baptized by John in the Jordan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mat 3:13-15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mar 1:9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John 1:29-31&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. John would have prevented him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?” But Jesus answered him, “Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he consented.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! This is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who ranks before me, because he was before me.’ I myself did not know him, but for this purpose I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it’s only a few verses in our Bibles, we need to remember that John and Jesus had probably never met until this day (and unlikely that John would remember doing a somersault in his mother Elizabeth’s womb over 30 years earlier); however, John 1:31 could also be interpreted that John initially did not recognize that Jesus was the Messiah, not that they were entirely unfamiliar with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, by now, we presume Joseph has died and Jesus has been left in charge of Mary and Jesus’ many siblings. John apparently recognized Jesus as soon as they saw each other and makes a Passover allusion to the sacrificial lamb and Isaiah 53:7: He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth. John is certainly foreshadowing Jesus’ suffering and crucifixion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster paraphrases Matthew 3:14 as, “I need to be baptized by you WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT, yet you come to me to be baptized with water?”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fulfill-all-righteousness&#34;&gt;Fulfill all Righteousness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Jesus Himself did not need to be baptized for his sins, so what does Jesus mean by “fulfilling all righteousness?” Keener notes that Jesus’ response indicates his identification with Israel in obedience to the Law and by extension, larger humanity who DID need purification&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. To fulfill all righteousness means it’s the proper way of doing things in the proper order. A prophet in the spirit and power of Elijah must arise, identify, declare, and anoint the Messiah (who must of course allow Himself to be anointed). By being baptized by John, Jeremy Dehut in Following the Messiah Jesus “testified to the authenticity and authority of John’s message and continued providing an example of faithful submission.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few lessons back we looked at how the verse “out of Egypt I have called my son” exemplifies how Jesus mirrors the nation. As we will see in the next section, Jesus’ 40-day fast recalls Israel’s 40 years in the wilderness. Just as God sustained Israel in the wilderness so He sustained Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we get to the question of why a Sinless Jesus would need a baptism of repentance, we must remember that Jesus is a perfect representative of the nation, just as He is a perfect and sinless representative of humankind. As a representative of Israel, Jesus “passes through the waters of the Jordan” just like the Nation did. His “repentance” (so to speak) represented the “corporate guilt and confession”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of His people. Taylor goes on to say that Jesus’ temptations can also be viewed in light of this representative role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.16&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.17&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; and behold, a voice from heaven said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; And a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.21&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.22&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, like a dove; and a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.23&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And John bore witness: “I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him. I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’ And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Psalm 2:7&lt;/sup&gt; I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, “You are my Son; today I have begotten you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen 22:2&lt;/sup&gt; He said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 11:2&lt;/sup&gt; And the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 42:1&lt;/sup&gt; Behold my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights; I have put my Spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:60%; float:right&#34; /&gt;When I visited Israel in February 2013, I took this picture of a pair of doves at Jesus’ traditional baptism site. I wonder if they were only there for the tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that day many believed that God had gone silent. So, the heavens opening and the spirit poured out indicated that the Messianic era had arrived. John earlier proclaimed, “the kingdom of heaven is at hand” (Mat 3:1). “A kingdom needs a king and a messianic era needs a messiah.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s voice and John’s prophetic testimony are the two witnesses required to establish a matter; in this case, the stamp of approval on Jesus as Messiah. The Spirit would signify that the Messianic era is at hand. The spirit resting on Jesus could be an allusion to Genesis 1, where the Spirit of God moved over the surface of the waters, and Genesis 8, where the dove flew out over the waters and, finding no other place to land, came to “rest” on Noah (noach means rest in Hebrew). Despite our impression of doves as docile and peaceful, they are notoriously territorial. Lancaster writes, “His disciples probably understood Him to mean a sudden, startling rush of wind – only slightly less jarring than being struck by lightning.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My beloved son” could also be read as “my son, the beloved” or even “my son, whom I love” which also recalls Genesis 22 when Abraham is told “take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love and go to the land of Moriah and offer him there as a burnt offering”. Isaac is a type or a foreshadow of Jesus who would be sacrificed, thus Lancaster notes in apostolic theology, the “beloved one” becomes a title for the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this seems to highlight the messianic prophecy of Isaiah 11:2 “And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon Him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 3:23 says Jesus was “about 30” when He began His ministry. We should not take this to mean exactly 30. The precise date of one’s birth was not especially relevant in the ancient world. Lancaster supposes that this is 28 CE, which if he was born in 5 or 6 BCE makes Jesus 34 years old here and then 36 years old when he died. According to Jewish tradition, Isaac was also 36 at the time of his binding on the altar in Genesis 22.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.4.2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; And after fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.12&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.13&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; And he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.4.1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:1&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.4.2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing during those days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image5.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:80%&#34; /&gt;Bolen writes, “Because of its lack of water and good routes, the Judean wilderness&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; has been (mostly) uninhabited throughout history. Consequently, it was an ideal place for those seeking refuge from enemies or retreat from the world. John the Baptist preached here, and it seems likely that this was the wilderness where Jesus was tempted.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener writes, “Jesus was led into the wilderness just as Israel was led. Just as Moses fasted for 40/40, so did Jesus.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In fact, Mark 1:12 emphatically says the spirit forcibly drove Jesus out into the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is a shadow of both Moses and Israel. They were tested and God sustained them all. Jesus passed the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Christian traditions observe lent, where we abstain from certain pleasures, if not do a partial fast for 40 days between Ash Wednesday and Resurrection story. We do this in honor of Jesus’ 40 days in the wilderness. Jewish people similarly observe 40 days of Teshuva (“repentance”) which recalls the 40 years wandering in the wilderness (which is said to be one year for every day the spies were in the land). This concludes with Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement) which is a day of national fasting. Lancaster says, “Jewish liturgy treats the Day of Atonement as a day for dealing with Satan and his accusations. The liturgies of the day are filled with references to a legal showdown between Israel and the devil, which concludes with the scape goat being led out into the wilderness, symbolizing the defeat of evil.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars debate the moment in time when Jesus came to the full realization of His mission and destiny. Many speculate that it was at His baptism that the spirit descended. Lancaster speculates that the Satan’s temptations were an attempt to force Yeshua to question the revelation He just received. Maybe like in some movie where a normal person is given some superhuman ability, the Satan believes Jesus has the desire to try out His new superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three temptations will involve shortcuts to revealing His messianic identity and plan. Remember the phrase Jesus uses frequently between now and the triumphal entry: “My hour is not net come”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the first temptation is declaring that Jesus indeed trusts that revelation that He heard come from the mouth of the LORD. He did not need to prove it. Let’s break it down some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Satan begins with “If you are the son of God.” One of the main limitations of the written word is that we have to use our imaginations with respect to voice inflection and body language. Did the Satan say this scoffingly, inquisitively, or matter-of-factly? Since the Satan is the accuser, it’s not too difficult to imagine him taunting Jesus with this challenge. “Since we know God made manna from heaven in the wilderness if you are that God, you should be able to do the same thing in this wilderness. And by the way, I know you are hungry. Why don’t you just go ahead and fix yourself something to eat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus declines the invitation to demonstrate His messianic power. He will do it on His terms and in His timing. Jesus WILL provide bread, but it will be food for the people, not for Himself. He will serve others, not Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is the Word and the Bread of Life who has come down from heaven. He quotes Deuteronomy 8:3, which is a passage about how “God tested Israel in the wilderness by causing them to hunger and feeding them with manna.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Physical bread will temporarily relieve hunger but the Bread of Life, the very Words of God will cure spiritual hunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first temptation is declaring that Jesus indeed trusts that revelation that He heard come from the mouth of the LORD. He did not need to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.4.6&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, “‘He will command his angels concerning you,’ and “‘On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.4.7&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Jesus said to him, “Again it is written, ‘You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;9 And he took him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 for it is written, “‘He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you,’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 and “‘On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 And Jesus answered him, “It is said, ‘You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psa 91:11-14 For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways. [12] On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone. [13] You will tread on the lion and the adder; the young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot. [14] “Because he holds fast to me in love, I will deliver him; I will protect him, because he knows my name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deu 6:13-16 It is the LORD your God you shall fear. Him you shall serve and by his name you shall swear. [14] You shall not go after other gods, the gods of the peoples who are around you— [15] for the LORD your God in your midst is a jealous God—lest the anger of the LORD your God be kindled against you, and he destroy you from off the face of the earth. [16] “You shall not put the LORD your God to the test, as you tested him at Massah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we compare Matthew and Luke side-by-side we see that Luke reverses the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; temptations. Some may view this as the Gospel authors being unable to keep their stories straight, but another way of looking at it is that this demonstrates a lack of coordination and collusion among the authors. If one witness in a trial recalls she heard a dog bark and then a car horn, but another witness recalls she heard a car horn then a dog bark, we don’t typically assume one or the other is lying. It’s just a different recollection. The differences between Matthew and Luke are not significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is more significant is that leaping from a tall building is not typically a temptation to most people. The next matter is that before they were in the wilderness and now all of a sudden they are in Jerusalem. Scholars debate as to whether this is a vision, or whether they were supernaturally transported. I tend to vote against the vision. The leap has to be potentially fatal for the miracle the Satan is proposing to actually be miraculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a photo of the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The drop today is likely fatal but 2000 years ago, the Kidron valley below was much steeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a reminder that the Satan knows Scripture and he is an expert at making arguments. We need to be like Jesus and know the “whole council” of God so we don’t take Bible passages out of context, and don’t fall for it when others try to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Satan says, “look here. God says He will send His Psalm 91 angels to protect you.” Psalm 91 is a messianic passage (and the Satan knows this). Psalm 91 is a great passage and one we all would do well to memorize and rely on. However, a Tzaddiq (a righteous one) such as Jesus would have known that angelic protection is for ills that befall God’s servants, not for those who foolishly seek out danger. Therefore, we must know our Bible, and therefore we are going through the Gospels verse by verse in this series!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus counters with another passage from Deuteronomy. Note the context of “you shall not test the Lord” is not merely doing something foolish/sinful and asking God to make it right. The context is following after other gods spiritually. When we listen to the lies of the Satan, we are following after a false god. (ouch).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The testing at Massah refers to Exodus 17:7: And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the quarreling of the people of Israel, and because they tested the LORD by saying, “Is the LORD among us or not?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.4.8&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.4.9&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; And he said to him, “All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.4.10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Then Jesus said to him, “Be gone, Satan! For it is written, “‘You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;5 And the devil took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 and said to him, “To you I will give all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 And Jesus answered him, “It is written, “‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deut 6:13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan apparently is now convinced of Jesus’ messianic credentials, now offers Him a shortcut to usher in the Messianic Kingdom. Satan also likely knew the people were hoping for a conquering, military messiah. Here was a chance for Jesus to be this and skip all of that cross business. This might also be the Satan’s plea bargain; we make a deal here and I don’t go to the lake of fire later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer to Hebrews reminds us that Jesus “has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin” (Hebrews 4:15). As Missler used to quip, “If I offer to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge, are you tempted to buy it from me? Probably not, because you are relatively certain that I don’t own it. For this to be a valid temptation, that means Jesus is acknowledging that Satan has ownership of these things, and they truly are his to give away. Jesus doesn’t challenge Satan’s ownership.” One of the many subthemes in the Bible is what I might call “things out of place.” We opened the Gospels with King Herod ruling over the land, who was neither born king nor born Jewish. Herod’s power and riches were juxtaposed against the rightful king who came lowly in a cave surrounded by deplorable shepherds. In the last lesson, we saw John the Baptist, the son of Zechariah who officiated in the temple in Jerusalem. John, a Levite, should have been in Jerusalem at the temple but instead, we find him “exiled” to the wilderness, while the usurping Sadducees are running the Temple. Here, the world that rightly belongs to God is under the authority of the Satan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t know which mountain. Mt. Nebo would have been nearby in the wilderness. Mt. Nebo is where Moses surveyed the land. Others have suggested Mt. Hermon in the far north of Israel and is the highest peak in the land of Israel. Mt. Hermon is intriguing because of its association with demonic activity in antiquity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;worship-me&#34;&gt;Worship me&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Satan said, “worship me,” he wasn’t necessarily asking Jesus to change His mind and start following Satan with His whole heart (although he certainly could have been). During the days of the seven churches in Revelation, Rome generally let people, particularly Jews, practice their religion without interference (depending on who was in charge). But often what they had to do was, one day a year, offer a sacrifice to the emperor. In the seven letters, Jesus sternly chides those who are compromising in this way. This is still idolatry, no matter how seemingly insignificant the idolatrous act is. Conversely, Jesus lavishly praises those in Smyrna and other cities who kept themselves pure from idolatry. In fact, the Bible uses an interesting metaphor for idolatry: adultery. Idolatry is spiritual fornication and unfaithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a story of a mother who caught her child doing something and the response was “mom, I only did it once and it was only a little. I’m ok.” A few days later the mom made a batch of brownies and the son of course got very excited. He took one bite and the happiness immediately gagged. “What’s wrong honey,” said the mom. “These taste awful,” said the son. “What happened?” “Hmm that’s strange,” said the mom. “I only put a little bit of dog poo in the brownies. Not even a teaspoon. They should be ok.” Point made. Jesus demands complete purity. There will come a day when Jesus will take proper possession of the things of the earth that are currently in the hands of the usurper. There will be no shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion-the-devil-departs&#34;&gt;Conclusion: the devil departs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mat 4:11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mar 1:13b&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luk 4:13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.4.11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and were ministering to him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13 And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13 And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark and Luke give us interesting tidbits. Mark says he was with the wild animals and Luke says the devil departed until “an opportune time.” We infer that opportune time was at the Garden of Gethsemane. The animals underscore the point that Jesus was completely isolated. Satan often likes to attack us when we are isolated from other believers. The photo shows the Ibex, a type of wild goat that is common in the Judean wilderness.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-from-the-temptations&#34;&gt;Lessons from the Temptations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus concludes each test the way any good rabbi would; He makes an appeal to Scripture. “As it is written…” should be a phrase we as Talmidim begin to use frequently as we continue to learn to be imitators of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three temptations parallel the warning given in 1 John 2:15-17: Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world. And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bread – desire of the flesh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kingdoms – desire of the eyes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throw yourself down and angels will save – pride of life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Satan is basically recycling the approach he used in the Garden: “So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food (flesh), and that it was a delight to the eyes (eyes), and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise (pride of life), she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate” (Gen 3:6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first Adam couldn’t resist the temptation, but the Last Adam did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Episode 3 of the “Following the Messiah” series covers the Baptism and Temptation of Jesus. It is very much worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In THE FIRST SIGN, we join Yeshua and His handful of followers in the Jordan River Valley near Jericho. We follow them north along the eastern side and pick up more disciples on Lake Galilee’s north shore in Bethsaida and Capernaum. A fishing boat takes us across the lake to Magdala.  From there, it’s a day’s walk to Cana of Galilee on the northern slopes of the Nazareth ridge, where Yeshua and His first followers attend a wedding. From there, we follow them back to Capernaum on the north shore of Lake Galilee, where they join a pilgrimage making their way down the Jordan Valley, following its eastern bank, before crossing near Jericho and ascending to Jerusalem for the Festival of Passover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-gospel-of-john-as-a-legal-document&#34;&gt;The Gospel of John as a legal document&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 He came as a &lt;strong&gt;witness&lt;/strong&gt;, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 He was not the light, but came to bear &lt;strong&gt;witness&lt;/strong&gt; about the light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 Johnn bore &lt;strong&gt;witness&lt;/strong&gt; about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19 And this is the &lt;strong&gt;testimony&lt;/strong&gt; of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 He &lt;strong&gt;confessed&lt;/strong&gt;, and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21 And they &lt;strong&gt;asked&lt;/strong&gt; him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22 So they said to him, “Who are you? &lt;strong&gt;We need to give an answer&lt;/strong&gt; to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;31 I myself did not know him, but for this purpose I came baptizing with water, &lt;strong&gt;that he might be revealed&lt;/strong&gt; to Israel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;32 And John bore &lt;strong&gt;witness&lt;/strong&gt;: “I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;34 And I have seen and have borne &lt;strong&gt;witness&lt;/strong&gt; that this is the Son of God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;who-were-the-ioudaioi&#34;&gt;Who were the &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.875in&#34; alt=&#34;C:\PLBLsr\apr4\Priestly blessing during Sukkot at Western Wall, tb092302017.jpg&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The translation of Ioudaioi always and only as “Jews” sends the reader in the opposite direction from what the author intended.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will develop this in later lessons but John the Gospel Writer, is very loose with his terminology. &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt;, which is the word John uses that is typically translated as “the Jews”, could mean anything from all Jews, to all believing Jews, to those in leadership of the Jewish religious establishment, to those geographically in or from Judea, some other subset&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if Ioudaioi refers to the religious establishment, John may be indenting for us to understand a specific subset of that. For example, Nicodemus was part of the &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; religious establishment, but we can be confident he is not part of the &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; with whom Jesus has any quarrel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an analogy we could use the term “Americans” The Americans won the gold medal in 1980. All 300 million of us? No. 20 hockey players representing the country. We could also say the Americans bombed Syria. Well that doesn’t all 300 million of us, but maybe a squadron of planes acting on order from one President. We also say today that “the House passed” some piece of legislation; all that could mean is at least 50% of those present+ 1, not all 435 House members acting in unison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many of us have learned to see the “Jews” especially as John uses it has a negative connotation to mean ALL Jews everywhere. The gospel of John has been used to support anti-Semitic behavior in the name of Jesus. This is incorrect and terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the 1st-century church consisted of &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt;, so it is an error to say that ALL &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; are guilty of rejecting and killing Jesus. There are believing &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; and rejecting &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt;. The temple establishment opposed to Jesus and ultimately those who arrested Him and had Him executed could have been a very small number. Perhaps less than 35 and maybe even less than 20: in other words, a very small group of hidden players acting behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, we need to make sure some latent anti-Semitic bias is removed from our reading. We need to work to discern the context and which Ioudaioi group John is referencing. If the context is negative, it is probably only the “deep state” fraction of the Temple establishment. This group was primarily Sadducees and Herodians with a small number of Pharisees along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we see the term “Ioudaioi” we will leave it untranslated to remind us that we need to be Bereans and explore the context in which John uses the term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;geographic-setting&#34;&gt;Geographic setting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:5.07014in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 1:28 tells us that “these things took place in Bethany across the Jordan where John was baptizing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good scholars dispute the location of “Bethany Beyond the Jordan”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Location of Jesus’ baptism is widely believed to be in the vicinity of Jericho, but this doesn’t mean that John the Baptist didn’t have different locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some, such as Schlaegel&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, hold that “Bethany” is actually north, in the Golan heights, which would account for disciples from Galilee being present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first four disciples known to be in Jesus’ company at this point are all from Bethsaida: Andrew, John (the unnamed disciple), Peter, and Philip.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter and Andrew would later move to Capernaum (Mark 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems logical that Peter, Andrew, James and John probably had a fishing cooperative, perhaps as a customs tax avoidance ploy as one boat would be registered in Capernaum (Herod Antipas’ region) and the other in Bethsaida (Herod Philip’s region).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion with Nathaniel possibly takes place at Bethsaida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will then make their way past Capernaum and Magdala, through the valley of the doves to Cana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the wedding miracle, they will return to Capernaum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-135-37&#34;&gt;John 1:35-37&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples, and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!” The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John would seem to place verse 35 as being the next afternoon following Jesus’ baptism where the spirit came down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might have been the next day but it didn’t need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John, and indeed the entire eastern mindset, is not as bound to a strict chronological record as we in the west have been brought up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust&#34;&gt;Walking in His dust&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like John, we should demonstrate humility and keep our eyes on God’s bigger picture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests but also to the interests of others. (Php 2:3-4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John 1:35, John the Baptist essentially refers two of his own disciples to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a teacher saying, “you should really go to the church down the street; that teacher is better than I am”!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, this is essentially what John the Baptist says to his former disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It speaks of John’s humility and that fact that his eyes were on God’s bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is how it should be with us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-138-39&#34;&gt;John 1:38-39&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, “What are you seeking?” And they said to him, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are you staying?” He said to them, “Come and you will see.” So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi here is transliterated Hebrew, a clue that Jesus and His talmidim spoke Hebrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other places, we will see Raboni, which is transliterated Aramaic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aramaic was the everyday language, while, we presume, Hebrew was used by the devout or in religious settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government language would have been Greek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They probably knew enough Greek to understand commercial transactions and to interact with Roman officials but it is highly doubtful they would have spoken Greek among themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Gospels, the word rabbi always speaks of Jesus (except in Matthew 23 where Jesus discusses the word itself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi in that day was more a term of respect and not, as it means today, a teacher with specific training and ordination who performs a specific role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What are you seeking?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus asks us the same question every day and every moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the disciples, we rarely answer the question directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We answer it by our choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where are you staying?” is an indirect way of asking to follow Jesus. They were answering His question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll unpack this in a later lesson, but it appears that “calling disciples” was a process, not a one-time event (think of the job application and interview process).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Rabbi and his perspective talmidim would take some time to get to know each other before agreeing to a multi-year commitment to one-another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This viewpoint untangles the various “callings” of the disciples that are recorded in the gospels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come and See” – head’s up; pay attention; follow me and learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They stayed with Him that day for it was about the 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; hour”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; hour is probably around 4pm (but it depends on the time of year; an hour wasn’t 60 minutes but 1/12 of daylight).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have suggested this was erev-shabbat, Friday afternoon, and the disciples were hoping to score an invitation to spend Shabbat with the Master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They didn’t just stay with Jesus that “night” but “that day,” meaning Friday night and all day Saturday, Shabbat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine spending Shabbat, a free day, with Jesus. No appointments, no phones or TV; talking Bible until late at night and then again the next morning perhaps after Shabbat prayers at the local synagogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing Jesus, I bet the conversation wasn’t limited to just Bible study; I imagine Jesus challenged them to be better. Perhaps the conversation was uncomfortable but never awkward, because it’s Jesus, our ultimate fiduciary; the One who would lay down His life for our best interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their lives would never be the same; they had found the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times have we breezed past a Bible verse like “and they stayed with Him that day” and not really thought about the implications?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-140-42&#34;&gt;John 1:40-42&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter&amp;rsquo;s brother. He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which means Christ). He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of John. You shall be called Cephas” (which means Peter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learn that one of the two talmidim who spent shabbat with Yeshua that day was Andrew. Scholars presume the other was John himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simon Peter, Andrew, James, and John probably grew up together and were likely in their mid-teens when they first met Jesus.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messiah means “anointed one”; it is a title, which in Greek is translated as Christ. Given the above discussion, his disciples would have referred to Jesus as the Mashiach, Messiah, not “Christ”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A subtle miracle here: Jesus and Peter had not met before, yet Jesus knows not only his first name but his family name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Jew would have recognized this as a sign of a prophet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cephas is a transliteration of Kefa, which means “rock”; rock in Greek is “petros”, which is how we get Peter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably a prophetic nickname about Peter’s future role in the early church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to imagine that it baffled Shimon at the time. “Why are you calling me that? We just met.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He brought him to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Augustine reportedly said, “John’s Gospel is deep enough for an elephant to swim yet shallow enough for a child not to drown.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He finds the messiah. He tells someone else he has found the messiah. He brings that someone else to the messiah. That someone else changed the world for Messiah. (I said that, not Augustine!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-143-44&#34;&gt;John 1:43-44&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, “Follow me.” Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A disciple of that day would be no more inclined to drop everything and follow a complete stranger than we would be today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus casting some sort of spell over his disciples to make them follow him blindly is entirely inconsistent with Jesus’ later passages to count the cost before answering the call to be His disciple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, even though the text doesn’t say this, it seems safe to infer that Philip and Jesus met previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I know I’m usually the first to point out “the text doesn’t say that,” but this is where we need to be Bereans and exclude potential conclusions that are contradicted elsewhere in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I wasn’t there and anything could have happened, on the surface, Philip following Jesus blindly is not consistent with other portions of scripture and is not consistent with what we think we know about 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century discipleship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beit Tzaidah – house of fish nets, or more simply “fish town”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By piecing together various biblical and historical clues, scholars speculate that John’s father Zebedee ran a sizable fishing business that included a partnership with Simon and Andrew as well as his own sons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars began excavating “et Tell” and many have concluded it is the ancient Bethsaida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem in identifying et-Tell with Bethsaida is its distance from the Sea of Galilee and its elevation above the ancient level of the lake&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been there and it’s not so much the distance from the lake as the fact that it is a much higher elevation, even if we account for potentially higher lake levels back in Jesus’ day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT excavators have concluded that the village contained a fisherman’s home based on their discovery of two types of lead net weights. One weight was round, of the so-called musket type, and the second was elongated, similar in shape to a crooked needle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentioned by name seven times in the Gospels, Bethsaida is one of the most frequently mentioned cities in the New Testament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-145-46&#34;&gt;John 1:45-46&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one of whom Moses spoke was the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deut 18:15-18 “The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your brothers—it is to him you shall listen— just as you desired of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly, when you said, ‘Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God or see this great fire any more, lest I die.’ And the LORD said to me, ‘They are right in what they have spoken. I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. And I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 3:22 Moses said, ‘The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers. You shall listen to him in whatever he tells you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though we don’t have legal terms, note how everyone is testifying, as Philip is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathaniel also testifies to Nazareth’s insignificance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more than 200 people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the Davidic connections and the fact that they were likely insular, it is possible outsiders viewed the people of Nazareth as somehow affiliated with the corrupt Jerusalem leadership, which would have been a negative for other Galileans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 21 tells us that Nathaniel is from Cana, which makes the statement about Nazareth that much more of a burn; Cana was as insignificant as Nazareth was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars believe Nathaniel and Bartholomew are one and the same.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-147-49&#34;&gt;John 1:47-49&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!” Nathanael said to him, “How do you know me?” Jesus answered him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Nathaniel’s skepticism, Jesus testifies in Nathaniel’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathaniel means “God gave,” or perhaps “God’s gift.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fig tree reference is apparently something only Nathaniel understood, though generally, the fig tree represents national Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symbolically, trees also represented knowledge and teachers often taught under trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might be a subtle pun: Israel/Jacob WAS a man of deceit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the vision of the angels ascending and descending which Jesus will reference in the next segment, Jacob was fleeing precisely because of his deceit of Esau.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lizorkin speculates that John’s intended audience might have been non-&lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; followers of Israel’s God; for example, Samaritans and Essenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so, Nathaniel’s pronouncement carries more significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is not just King of the &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt;, He is King of all Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-150-51&#34;&gt;John 1:50-51&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus answered him, “Because I said to you, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these.” And he said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly, truly is literally, “amen, amen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Heaven opened” indicates a major revelation from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This imagery evokes Jacob’s dream in Genesis 28:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And he dreamed, and behold, there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it! And behold, the LORD stood above it and said, “I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring.” (Gen 28:12-13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathaniel could have been reading Genesis 28 as he sat under the fig tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Samaritans have a specific attachment to Jacob and his favorite son, Joseph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John 4 we will be at Jacob’s well in Sychar, where the Samaritan woman will ask, “Are you greater than our father Jacob?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Jesus is seemingly anticipating that question and His answer is an emphatic “YES.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angels Jacob saw are not ascending and descending at a place in Samaria but upon Jesus Himself.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is the bridge/ladder between heaven and earth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-21-2&#34;&gt;John 2:1-2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.29514in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus also was invited to the wedding with his disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could refer to the third day of the week, Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, the third day of creation, was the day God said “It was good” twice (1:10 and 1:12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it is the “day of the double blessing,” some speculate that weddings were often held on Tuesdays, but this is disputed&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could also mean simply three days had elapsed since the discussion with Nathaniel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may also be literary bracketing; in John 2:19, Jesus says, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John is not necessarily chronological; while in our minds, John 2 occurs when Jesus is still relatively obscure, it is possible that wedding occurred after Jesus and his disciples had gained some regional notoriety and would be honored guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the map&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, you can see there are two contenders for Cana; one is off the beaten path, and the other happens to be on the main road from Nazareth to Tiberias (in other words, easier for the tour busses)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most scholars I’ve come across tend to side with the less accessible site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than officiating the wedding, Lancaster says that Jewish sages were invited to liven things up. The Talmud records the disciples of Hillel would sing before the bride and others added joy in various ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this tidbit fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there another wedding at some point in our future that Jesus will preside over where He will add joy? YES. You can read about it in Revelation 19 and all of the various wedding feast references in the New Testament – there are several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was about to inject more joy to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-23-5&#34;&gt;John 2:3-5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, “They have no wine.” And Jesus said to her, “Woman, what does this have to do with me? My hour has not yet come.” His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is today, if the host runs out of food or drink at a wedding it would be a major social faux-pas. 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Century Jewish wedding celebrations typically lasted for seven days and the host was responsible for providing this quantity of wine to his invited and uninvited guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commentator John Lightfoot believes that Mary might have had a formal role in the planning of the feast and was not merely being a busy body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Messianic Age is often depicted as a wedding banquet with free-flowing wine&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Holy One, blessed be He, will make a banquet for the righteous in the Garden of Eden…He will give them to drink wine preserved in its grapes since the six days of creation” (Numbers Rabbah 13:2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was Mary asking for the inauguration of the Messianic Age, and this is why Jesus replies as He does?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reply by Jesus to Mary’s request is not nearly as cold-sounding as it is in English and he is not disobeying the commandment to honor His mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can imagine Mary struggled to understand all of the various signs and wonders that she pondered in her heart since before Jesus was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From her response, “it is evident she was neither dissatisfied nor put off&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;” by Jesus’ remark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern speculates that Jesus was attempting to curtail Mary’s natural pride as the mother of the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus WOULD address the literal problem Mary brought to Him; but He would not do it in the public way that she hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say often that the people wanted a political messiah, not the suffering messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Mary didn’t want the political Messiah, then perhaps she wanted the happy, festive messiah, not the sword-piercing messiah (that prophecy in Luke 2:23 was probably still bothering her)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all need to be careful not to make God in our image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film series “The Chosen” takes the angle that Mary is not looking for personal glory but is merely trying to save her friend the public shame of running out of wine.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of Jesus reply being curt or disrespectful, the question is inquisitive, “why are you telling me this?” He then reiterates that it’s not the time for a public sign. To which Mary says “please…” – Jesus being Jesus figures out a way to honor His mother but have the sign kept quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I like about this portrayal is that it challenges the common narrative that Jesus was being rude. It gives us another way to look at the story – as long as it is still faithful to the Bible I think we should get comfortable with holding a couple of open options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting that many of the earliest Jewish commentaries weren’t commentaries as we think of them but paraphrases that creatively add in details that are omitted by the text. For example, the Jewish targum on Genesis 1:2 reads, “And the earth was vacancy and desolation, solitary of the sons of men, and void of every animal; and darkness was upon the face of the abyss, and the Spirit of mercies from before the Lord breathed upon the face of the waters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While always need to make sure any paraphrase lines up with scripture, God did give us the gift of imagination. There’s a time and a place for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase the exchange:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary: They have no more wine. I know you are the promised Messiah who is supposed to bring in the endless supply of wine. So bring some now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus: What can I do about it now? The Messianic Era when the supply of wine will be inexhaustible has not yet come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary (undaunted and in faith): Do whatever He tells you.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it wasn’t His time, the wedding feast at Cana, carries prophetic anticipation to the ultimate wedding feast, the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-26-8&#34;&gt;John 2:6-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there were six stone water jars there for the Ioudaioi’s rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water.” And they filled them up to the brim. And he said to them, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.” So they took it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; refers not to a people but to proper religious procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another suggestion that John is explaining the situation for non-Jewish readers, but ones who were loosely familiar with the procedure (as he doesn’t go into great detail about the reason for the purification rite).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though John may have been written to non-Jewish Israelites such as Samaritans, Jesus is clear that the Jewish method is the correct one (“Salvation is of the Jews.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do learn a couple of things about the Ioudaioi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ioudiaoi were not necessarily limited to the geographic terrotiry of Jerusalem or even Judea. This is in Cana in Galilee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every reference to Ioudaioi is referring to the temple establishment; as is the case here, it could be followers of the Jewish system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the audience were Jews as say in Matthew’s gospel, this qualifier would have been entirely unnecessary; John apparently expects his audience to be with purification rituals, but not necessarily JEWISH purification rituals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the size of the “jars” – they are almost as big as wine barrels – a significant quantity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John doesn’t tend to use numbers and details by accident so there is likely some significance to the six stone jars used for ceremonial washing – unfortunately, what that symbolism might have been is lost on us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first of seven major miracles in John’s gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John is testifying that he was an eyewitness that creation submitted to Jesus’ authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The master of the feast was responsible for the details of the banquet freeing up the host to attend to his guests and the festivities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He pronounced the blessings over the food and wine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, the first blessing over the first cup of wine was called the kos habesorah – cup of the good news.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The blessing was to declare and certify the bride’s purity.&lt;/strong&gt; Wow. Let that sink in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also was tasked with controlling the flow of food and drink; thus he would have been responsible for running out of wine prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-29-10&#34;&gt;John 2:9-10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the master of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew, the master of the feast called the bridegroom and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the poor wine. But you have kept the good wine until now.””&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the story is very familiar to us, this was a very private miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener notes that drunkenness to be part of the celebration at Cana is unlikely and the wine was often diluted 2:1 or 3:1.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-211-12&#34;&gt;John 2:11-12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory. And his disciples believed in him. After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother and his brothers and his disciples, and they stayed there for a few days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 11 is our memory verse for this lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John gives us the reason for the wine miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Stern says, the reason is “to anchor the trust of his new talmidim in the glory of God as manifested through Him.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson began with Andrew proclaiming Jesus as the one Moses spoke of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses’ first miracle was water to blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ first miracle was water to wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is unlikely to be a coincidence (the rabbis say “coincidence is not a kosher word.”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We look forward to OUR great messianic wedding banquet where wine will flow in abundance and Jesus will proclaim the wedding blessings over His bride.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeshua is IN JERUSALEM, the holy city, for the Passover festival and remains in Judea for a few extra weeks while His disciples immerse new penitents. Meanwhile, John the Immerser moves his work into Samaria and begins immersing “at Aenon near Salim,” leaving Yeshua and His followers to baptize in the area around Jerusalem. Salim is a fertile valley in Samaria east of Shechem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “First” Passover&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “First” overturning of the tables&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick at Night&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 3:16&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many scholars believe John is recording separate accounts from the synoptic gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) while others contend John is interweaving the same events and is not necessarily interested in following a strict chronology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem with treating them each as separate is that we would end up with Jesus celebrating five or six Passovers during the time of his public ministry. You can’t fit more than four Passovers in a 3-year public ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, if Jesus drove out the profiteers one year, it’s easy to see they would be right back at it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reasons we have discussed I tend to believe Luke follows a strict chronology, but whichever view you hold on this I would recommend not holding on to it too tightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, focus on what each gospel writer is trying to communicate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:5.30217in;height:7.5in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended last lesson with the wedding at Cana (box 4) and Jesus spending a few days in Capernaum. Now, an unknown amout of time has passed and the next major event John records is the “first” Passover in Jerusalem, represented as event #5 according to Schlaegel , who views John’s recount of the temple cleansing as a separate event from the cleansing at Jesus’ final Passover as recorded in the synoptic Gospels. The counter-argument is that John is not as interested in chronology and could be placing the later event here for his own purposes. There are very smart people on both sides of the argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-213-17--the-passover-of-the-ioudaioi&#34;&gt;John 2:13-17 – The Passover of the Ioudaioi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.50311in;height:4.35in&#34; alt=&#34;C:\Users\Public\_Bethany\john2plus\Samaritan Passover, courtyard with men, tb043007194.jpg&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 The Passover of the Ioudaioi was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eli believes John specifies the Passover of the Ioudaioi to differentiate from the Passover of the Shomrim, the Samaritans because John has the Samaritans as one of his intended audiences. The Qumranites also held their own Passover according to their own calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samaritans are still around today and continue to celebrate a biblical Passover in much the same way that they have for more than two thousand years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the temple in Jerusalem does not exist, Jews do not practice animal sacrifice and thus the closest we can get to the practices of the first century is at the Samaritan celebration each year on Mount Gerizim.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a Jewish audience, and even to most gentiles, it would not be necessary to specify that it was a Jewish Passover; he could have just said “Passover.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.875in&#34; alt=&#34;C:\PLBL\03 Jerusalem\Southern Temple Mount Excavations\Shops underneath staircase of Robinson&amp;#39;s Arch, tb020101216.jpg&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money-changers sitting there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 And making a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and oxen. And he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 And he told those who sold the pigeons, “Take these things away; do not make my Father&amp;rsquo;s house a house of trade.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17 His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archaeologists have discovered shops built outside the Temple Mount on both the western and southern walls. Jesus presumably had no objection to these. What He took offense with was the commercial activity that had invaded the places intended for worship on the Temple Mount itself. tb020101216&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shops occupied the space underneath the monumental staircase that passed over Robinson’s Arch to provide access to the temple courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also that the things the people were selling were necessary for the Passover procedures at the temple and the money changers served an entirely practical purpose. Keener notes that money changers were needed to standardize the various foreign currencies of the pilgrims so the local sellers didn’t have to worry about “exchange rates” if I can use that term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can surmise that just like today a tourist can get swindled with an unfair exchange rate and a merchant can overcharge the unsuspecting, the same thing must have been happening at the temple. Dishonest money changers and merchants were profiteering at the expense of God’s faithful, likely in collusion with each other. Today that is called racketeering and is very much frowned upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked a little about whether this cleansing is the same as the one the synoptic gospels record at the end of Jesus’ ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately we recommend to not focus on whether this was the same or different events but focus on what each gospel is teaching us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eli notes that the quote John uses “Zeal for your house will consume me” is different from the quote the synoptic writers use, “my house shall be called a prayer for all nations, but you have made it a robber’s den.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John has in view an issue of purity whereas the synoptics appear to have a concern for the negative impression the spectacle of buying and selling has on the Gentiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eli sees John as providing evidence that the temple is unfit for proper worship because it is being controlled by apostates. It needed to be cleansed of this impurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.32222in&#34; alt=&#34;C:\Users\Public\_Bethany\john2plus\Fallen stones from Temple Mount destruction, tb090705034.jpg&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18 So the Ioudaioi said to him, “What sign do you show us for doing these things?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19 Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 The Ioudaioi then said, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21 But he was speaking about the temple of his body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning of Ioudaioi here is different than the meaning in verse 13. Before it referd to all jews or a Jewish religious observance in contrast to some other religious observance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, it appears to mean a few representatives of the Sadducean temple authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reasons we can only speculate, John never uses the term Saducee (this is a big clue that the first part of John 8, while historically accurate, was not written by John. It appears to be a later scribal insertion.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharisees were not in charge of the temple and, assuming this is early in Jesus’ ministry, Pharisees were similarly interested in the purity of worship and probably agreed with Jesus’ actions here (though they were unlikely to admit it publicly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few points where we might be tempted to place the wrong emphasis in a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We probably read this as, “what SIGNS do you show us for doing these things?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More likely it should be, “what signs do you SHOW US for doing these things?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sadducees thought they were the authority; one of John’s themes is the Sadducees are the usurpers – Jesus is the rightful authority no matter what the Sadducees think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photo: Archaeologists excavated this area in the 1990s and left these stones in place as a testimony to the Roman destruction in AD 70. Archaeologists have estimated that if all the Herodian stones which are in secondary use around Jerusalem were gathered together, almost the entire height of the Temple Mount walls could be reconstructed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While here, Jesus wasn’t necessarily predicting the destruction of the Literal Temple, in Luke 21 Jesus does exactly this. He says “not one stone will be left upon another” – today you can visit the southwest corner at the base of the temple mount and see that this prophecy was not only fulfilled, but literally fulfilled. Not one stone was left upon another&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tb090705034&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22 When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many believed in his name when they saw the signs that he was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24 But Jesus on his part did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25 and needed no one to bear witness about man, for he himself knew what was in man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Jesus is perfect, He is perfectly compassionate. He didn’t just heal for the sake of healing; he performed these miraculous acts as acts of compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster: “In Jewish thought a person’s name conveys authority. To believe on the name of Yeshua is to accept His authority as an Agent of God. They believed Him to be the promised Messiah”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 24 reads strange to us, “He did not need anyone’s testimony about a person because he knew what was within a person, or some translations have “within the heart of man.” This could be another way of saying that he told others to not tell anyone. He does not need man’s testimony and in fact preferred to keep a low profile for a number of reasons. He did not want to be seen as one who wanted to attract big crowds, though ultimately big crowds are exactly what happened. He also did not want to attract the attention of the establishment and roman authorities prematurely. He was not fomenting a revolution. He will say repeatedly that “my hour has not yet come.”. We can see the traps of fame very clearly today. People latch on to powerful and influential people for their own ulterior motives. Jesus wanted no part of such people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John is also attesting to Jesus’ divinity. Just as with Nethaniel under the fig tree, Jesus knows what is in man’s hearts – things only God can know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 3:1-35&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother&amp;rsquo;s womb and be born?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 Nicodemus said to him, “How can these things be?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 Jesus answered him, “Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen, but you do not receive our testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some commentators see 3:16-21 as John the apostle writing his own commentary in summation of the Nicodemus dialogue. Others see the passage as Jesus’ own words, continuing the dialogue with Nicodemus. I would favor these being Jesus’ words, but I can see why people think they might be John’s there are certainly some similarities to passages such as chapter 1, which we know are John’s writings. Ultimately, we would say John is inspired by the Holy Spirit so we can be confident John 3:16 is from the mouth of God, even if not spoken by Jesus to Nicodemus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we don’t want to do is view John 3:16-21 as a separate thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image26.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:3.6in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image27.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:6.73667in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image6.png&#34; style=&#34;width:0.4265in;height:0.42654in&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image30.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:3.6in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image23.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.40333in;height:4.11in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image31.png&#34; style=&#34;width:2.61in;height:2.57667in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image6.png&#34; style=&#34;width:0.4265in;height:0.42654in&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAD to return to Galilee through Samaria. Usually Jews would avoid Samaritans and take the way down the mountain through Jericho then head north along the Jordan. This time, Jesus is going to head due north along the way of the patriarchs, the &amp;lt;click&amp;gt; same road Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob traveled when they needed to go north/south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-314-16&#34;&gt;John 3:14-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image34.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:3.6in&#34; /&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is still answering Nicodemus’ question, “how can these things be?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Only Son” recalls Genesis 22 and Abraham’s near offering of Isaac, where Isaac is called Abraham’s “only” (or “unique”) son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 3:16 is famous precisely because of the fact it requires no additional insight or commentary to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Son of God expresses the true nature of Jesus eternal and essential being. He is the LOGOS made flesh, the Son has emanated forth from God.” That’s a quote from Lancaster’s commentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern notes that while Matthew presents Jesus as coming for the lost sheep of Israel, John emphasies that Jesus has come to Jews and Gentiles alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image35.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:3.6in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God loves His creation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gives His creation that which is most precious to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is God’s unique son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was fully aware that he would have to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eternal suffering is punishment not only for the inevitable consequence of sin, but now, in rejecting God’s provision for that sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the individual who trusts in Jesus, eternal life means not only in the future beyond the grave, but positive life now in Jesus – life more abundantly. – from David Stern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the Jewish concept of verbs is always tied to action. Belief is not mere intellectual acknowledgment, but a life that reflects a fundamental trust in and reliance on Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-317-18&#34;&gt;John 3:17-18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image39.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:3.6in&#34; /&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a debate about whether 3:16-21 is Jesus still speaking to Nicodemus or whether the conversation ends at 3:15, and 16-21 is John’s commentary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supporters of the later view note the similarity between this passage (verse 18 for example) and John 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either way, these words are powerful and for the most part, self-explanatory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note the tie-in to believing in His name in Chapter 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first-coming was not to bring judgment. That is handled the second coming – read the book of Revelation for more information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember this thought that he did not come to condemn when we get to the scene at the synagogue at Nazareth. Jesus is going to read from Isaiah 61 but He’s going to omit a line that turns out to be very telling in differentiating between the first and second comings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image40.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:7.11111in;height:4in&#34; /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;John (or Jesus) is continuing to contrast light versus dark, innocent vs guilty, saved vs John 3:18 condemned (based on faith, not lineage or works), righteous versus wicked,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Dead Sea scrolls also make these contrasts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-319&#34;&gt;John 3:19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image44.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:3.6in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is now compared to a light coming into the world, which certainly recalls Genesis 1:3-4. As we studied back in the first lesson, there are many parallels with John 1 and Genesis 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image45.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:7.11111in;height:4in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jesus’s day, the city would not have been as well-lit after dark. A quick Greek lesson – we often hear that the word “&lt;em&gt;agape&lt;/em&gt;” means God’s perfect love. Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives at night (from the east)o o Verse 19 reads, men &lt;em&gt;agapao&lt;/em&gt; the darkness&amp;hellip;because their deeds are evil. o It’s better to think of Agape as to be totally and completely given over to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you totally and completely given over to God, or do we give part to God but save part for the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Note the design:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passage begins with the dark heart (i.e. lies) of man and the meeting with Nicodemus is in the literal darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passage ends with the truth and light of God. o As a literary form, this type of bracketing is common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiritually, John’s point is the believer passes from death to life; from darkness to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to look at a verse like verse 19 and conclude that is only referring to people who reject God. Well, of course it is, but what we forget is that was you and me at one point. Our sin nature still agapao’s darkness rather than light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tb031505530b&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-320-21&#34;&gt;John 3:20-21&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image49.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:3.6in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For those who agapao darkness, the last thing they want is to have their deeds exposed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For disciples, who believe in the Son (John 3:16), this faith results in the believer moving into the light. Such belief is supposed to manifest in good deeds; thus the believer is unafraid to have the light expose righteous works.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John 3:36 reiterates this thought of obedience. “Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The church at learge today teaches, “just believe and you’re in”. As if our faith is all boiled down to acknowledging a certain set of facts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;True talmidim, Believe Him, walk with Him, and follow Him and OBEY him o Lancaster writes, “Belief in Him needs to result in repentance and turning towards God.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image50.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:7.11111in;height:4in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nicodemus came with questions. Perhaps he initially left with More questions but God rewards a heart that seeks after Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We know from John 7 and John 19 that Nicodemus was and is a believer. Despite his wealth and his status, His interview with Jesus changed His life forever. Nicodemus is one person I’m looking forward to meeting one day in the age to come.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John’s imprisonment is reported in Mat 14:3-12 and Mark 6:17-29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is some speculation that John the gospel writer is the unnamed Jew.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image53.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:7.11111in;height:4in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hills in the distance belong to Gilead, in the modern country of Jordan. The ponds in the distance reflect the availability of water from springs here and are used for raising fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The themes of purification, living water, spirit are throughout the early chapters of John.John 3:23&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ch 1: waters of baptism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ch 2: stone jars of purification and cleansing/purifying of the temple o Ch 3: born of water and spirit and this discussion beginning with v. 22 o Ch 4: the Woman at the Well and the discussion of living water&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ch 5: the false waters of the Asklepion of Bethesda versus the One who can bring true restoration and purification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also references to purification by water in chapters 7, 9 13, and 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among many contrasts, John is pointing out that Jesus is the ceremonially pure one in contrast to the general world at large and the temple establishment in particular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-326&#34;&gt;John 3:26&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image57.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:3.6in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 4:2 is going to clarify that Jesus was not immersing but his talmidim were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image61.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:3.6in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John describes his role in the form of a parable o Bride: Israel o Groom: Messiah o Friend: John&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing the Bride to the Groom: John’s ministry of immersion and repentance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voice: Jesus’ call or Jesus going public with His ministry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning: “John’s role was only to prepare Israel for Messiah and then step aside.” (Lancaster, COM 247)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John did not want his own works to overshadow Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While John’s and possibly Jesus’ disciples were beginning to form a Jordan River Rivalry, John is uninterested in the dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is John NOT upset, he is joyful. Weddings are supposed to be joyful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lancaster suggests John is playing the role of Moses, who brings the bride (Israel) to meet the groom (God).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 30 is an important one for Talmidim. It’s not about us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we are ambassadors for Jesus, we put His interests first and ours second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walking In His Dust&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talmidim keep our eyes on God’s bigger picture.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ephesians 4:1-3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I therefore, a prisoner for the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which you have been called, with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all &lt;strong&gt;humility&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;gentleness&lt;/strong&gt;, with &lt;strong&gt;patience&lt;/strong&gt;, bearing with one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;another in &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt;, eager to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;maintain the &lt;strong&gt;unity&lt;/strong&gt; of the Spirit in the bond of peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

The first was when he allowed two of his disciples to switch teachers. The more we can keep our own pride and ego in check, the more the Light of Jesus can shine through us. The Ultimate goal is when people see us, they don’t see us, they see Jesus through us.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 15:47-49 The first man&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven. As was the man of dust, so also are those who are of the dust, and as is the man of heaven, so also are those who are of heaven. Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image6.png&#34; style=&#34;width:0.4265in;height:0.42654in&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John now moves into a discourse comparing the earthly man vs the heavenly man. Paul framed this in terms of the first Adam vs the last adam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image66.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:7.11111in;height:4in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image67.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:2.74036in;height:4.19443in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image68.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:3.21254in;height:2.40941in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image6.png&#34; style=&#34;width:0.47407in;height:0.47407in&#34; /&gt;Note the recurring themes of “witness,” “testimony,” and so forth. Discovered in Cave 4 of Qumran in the early 1950s, this text contains five biblical verses that focused on the coming of the Messiah. Cave 4 is the famous cave where many books of the Old Testament were found,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;including a complete copy of Isaiah.Dead Sea Scroll 4Q175 Testimonia (“Messianic Anthology”), 1st century BC John 3:32&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is another instance where John seemingly breaks off from quoting someone and adds his own commentary. This passage is a little clearer than John 3:16-21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 3:16 is clearly a continuation of the discussion with Nicodemus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, John is picking up the mystical discourse of the Preexistent One he established in Chapter 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’ve talked about before; John is focused with establishing (giving witness) to who Jesus is, whereas the other gospels focus on what jesus said, did and felt, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the synoptic gospels say “the kingdom of heaven is at hand,” John is going to say “Light has come into the world,” because “light” is who Jesus is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image72.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:3.6in&#34; /&gt;Whoever receives his testimony sets his seal to this, that God is true. For he whom God has sent utters the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure. The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;John 10:29&lt;/sup&gt; My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father&#39;s hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 28:18 And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image6.png&#34; style=&#34;width:0.4265in;height:0.42654in&#34; /&gt;On wrath: Romans 1:182:8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seal = authentication, like a notary’s stamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take a passage such as “the spirit without measure” for granted, but it was not a simple topic in Jesus’ day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Psalm 51, David could pray, “take not your Spirit from me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have been sealed by the Spirit as described by the apostolic documents, we can NOT pray this prayer, nor would it ever occur to us to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Judaism of the day, only the righteous could merit the Spirit (in a grand sense, that is still true today).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the concept of authorization is present in John’s gospel. The Son is the fully authorized representative of the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For God to give the Spirit without measure would have been another seismic shift in their thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John, again stresses Jesus authority by saying the father has given all things &amp;lt;read references&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t read the Bible and come up with multiple ways to salvation. Either believe in the Son and have eternal life, or disobey and experience God’s wrath. I suppose that makes us narrow minded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;john-41-4-references&#34;&gt;John 4:1-4 References&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image73.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:3.6in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image6.png&#34; style=&#34;width:0.4265in;height:0.42654in&#34; /&gt;Now when Jesus learned that the &lt;em&gt;Pharisees&lt;/em&gt; had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John (although Jesus himself did not baptize, but only his disciples), he left Judea and departed again for Galilee. And he had to pass through Samaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chapter breaks can be most unfortunate because we subconsciously view them as a scene shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John needs to be read in one sitting because everything ties together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Son, who is the Father’s authenticated representative, gives the Spirit without measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the Son, is going to widen the people’s narrow view of who is eligible to receive the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus popularity was growing, but Jesus was not ready to go full throttle with public ministry in Judea, so he makes a strategic retreat back to Galilee. This is one reason I tend to see the overturning of the tables as occurring at the end of Jesus’ ministry, but John places it early to tell his version of the story. It seems odd that Jesus would have make spectical in Jerusalem, not caring who he angered, but then retreated here not wanting a confrontation. I might be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth mentioning again that when John says “Pharisees” we need to remember that John uses this term very generically, to include herodians and sadducees as well as the party of the Pharisees. In other words, the whole religious establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need to look closely at the context to decide whether we have Pharisees or Sadducees in view. There is a big difference,” writes Lancaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like someone saying “the politicians” and we need to figure out whether they are liberal or conservative, corrupt or clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the Pharisees were all about having disciples and followers. They were all about the purity of the Law and as yet, Jesus had done nothing to arouse their suspicion. If overturning the tables had happened here, the Pharisees probably would have applauded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;26&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image74.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:7.11111in;height:4in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image75.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:5.97689in;height:4in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image76.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:2.96612in;height:4.19451in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image6.png&#34; style=&#34;width:0.47407in;height:0.47407in&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IN SAMARIA follows Jesus as he leaves Jerusalem and make his way back north to Galilee. Yeshua elects to travel through Samaria, the most direct route to reach Nazareth. We stop at the village of Sychar where Yeshua encounters the Samaritan woman. His disciples return to their homes on the lake, Yeshua take us to Cana. An official from Capernaum travels to Cana to find Yeshua and to implore Him to heal his son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Anachronism&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Misappropriating concepts in time.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“Paul came to cast off Judaism and convert to Christianity.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gentile Christianity as a distinct religion from Judaism would not begin until the late 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century and, arguably was not completed until Constantine. Also, a careful reading of Acts indicates that Paul remained a Torah-observant Jew and considered himself a Pharisee.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Bicameral Thinking&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evaluating two (or more) opposing but seemingly plausible viewpoints and drawing biblical application regardless of which one is factual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bicameral thinking forces us to be Bereans and look at a matter from a different perspective. We may even find that one (or both) viewpoints may be invalid and we must come up with a fresh hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&#34;You have had five husbands and the man you have now is not your husband.  What you have said is quite correct.&#34;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The woman at the well was steeped in sin and was being snotty and disrespectful. Jesus calls out her sin to set her straight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The woman had an extraordinarily hard life with multiple husbands abandoning her despite being well educated in Samaritan religion. Jesus is showing her compassion because He is the God who Sees (El Roi - Genesis 16).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Eisegesis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Reading external presuppositions into the biblical text.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“The woman at the well was being snotty and disrespectful.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;If our presupposition is that the Gospel writers communicated “Judaism bad, Christianity good,” this viewpoint is going to influence our interpretations, even though a plain reading of the text may not support our conclusions.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Exegesis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Letting the text speak for itself.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“Jesus and the woman were engaged in a sophisticated theological discussion.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The text supports the Samaritan woman was reasonably well educated in matters of Torah, at least as practiced by Samaritans. The text also supports that Jesus is instructing her that Judaism is the more correct way.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Macro-narrative&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Larger themes that emerge above the individual stories&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&#34;How is that you, a &lt;i&gt;Ioidaiois&lt;/i&gt;...&#34;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Here, the woman is identifying Jesus as a Jew.  Later, Pilate will also identify Jesus as a Jew. This is something the Jewish leadership never does. Thus, one of John&#39;s macro-narratives is authentication.  Those who should have authenticated Jesus did not; those who should not have authenticated Him, actually do authenticate Him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Presuppositions&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Our assumptions we bring with us as we read the text, including those not directly supported by the text.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&#34;Sir,  you have nothing to draw with.&#34;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;If we view the woman as snotty and sarcastic, we&#39;re potentially going to view this passage as combative.  If we take a view that the woman is a sinner, no better or worse than the rest of us and she&#39;s merely having a discussion with Jesus on par with the one Nicodemus had, we&#39;re going to have a different view of the passage.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:6.15556in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve done a separate background video on the Samaritans where we briefly touch on the Jewish/Samaritan tensions and explore what lessons this may have for us today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jews tended to avoid Samaria and taking the long way around when traveling to/from Jerusalem. This makes the statement that Jesus “had to pass through Samaria” startling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John’s view, God so loved the world, which even included Samaritans. The path of travel is unusual because this is no ordinary love. Jesus can take us to strange, perhaps hostile and heretical, territory to shine His light of truth if we let Him lead us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.30631in;height:4.2612in&#34; alt=&#34;A picture containing outdoor, mountain, grass, nature Description automatically generated&#34; /&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mt-gerezimshechem&#34;&gt;Mt. Gerezim/Shechem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setting for John 4 is Sychar, which is adjacent to Jacob’s well and Shechem. We also have a separate insites video on Shechem, but the big thing to know is that Shechem is flanked by two mountains Mt. Ebal, which is where God commanded the curses to be read and Mt. Gerezim, which is where the blessings were read. Both the woman and Jesus will reference “this mountain.” They are referring to Mt. Gerezim, which was the holy place for the Samaritans (in contrast to Mt. Zion/Jerusalem which is sacred to Jews).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-acts-1711-rereading-a-beloved-story&#34;&gt;An Acts 17:11 Rereading a beloved Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:5.47375in;height:3.76367in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the vast majority of commentaries, the woman at the well as assumed to be one of lose morals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theis is based on the “five husbands and the one you have now is not your husband” comment by Jesus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the text doesn’t directly say this, it’s easy to conclude that the woman is a fallen, meaning sexually promiscuous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us have come to accept this conclusion at face value, because it’s what we’ve all been taught (myself included).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must be aware that this view is going to color our interpretation of the entire passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if there is another explanation for the “five husbands” statement one that sees the woman in a far more charitable view? Our understanding of the woman would completely change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his commentary on the gospel of John, Messianic scholar Dr. Eli Lizorkin presents us with an alternate way to read the story of the Samaritan woman at the well, particularly verses 10-20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to present that here and then ask that we be Bereans and test the theory to see whether it can be supported by Scripture and the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself saying, “that’s not right” first of all that’s good. Never ever take my word for it. Ask whether the “immoral woman” conclusion is something you’ve always been taught or something you’ve checked out for yourself. For most of us, it’s probably the former.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re going to dive into Lizorkin’s theory, not because I’m convinced it’s right in every detail but I think it provides one of the clearest examples of someone who is being a Berean and not afraid to swim against the current of mainstream commentators. There are a lot of lessons there for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of discussion, let’s not assume the worst about this woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt; At the end of the day I like what Dr. Bob Cargill, who is a professor of archaeology at Iowa university and editor-in-chief of Biblical Archaeology Review, says in his courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My job is not to &lt;strong&gt;tell you&lt;/strong&gt; what to think. My job is to &lt;strong&gt;get&lt;/strong&gt; you to think.” As much as possible, we should not automatically accept someone else’s conclusion without doing our own homework. TO me that is the essence of Acts 17:11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-45-8-in-sychar-at-noon-with-joseph&#34;&gt;John 4:5-8: In Sychar at Noon with Joseph&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So He came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the parcel of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph; and Jacob’s well was there. So Jesus, tired from His journey, was just sitting by the well. It was about the sixth hour. A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give Me a drink.” For His disciples had gone away to the city to buy food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.30556in&#34; alt=&#34;A picture containing text, furniture, rug, mat Description automatically generated&#34; /&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alternate-viewsquestions&#34;&gt;Alternate views/questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sixth hour is around noon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many commentators make the time of day a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Only a fallen woman would be out in the heat of the day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some immediate problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noon is not the hottest part of the day, which is usually between 2-4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it’s true the Bible says the evening time is when women go out to draw water (Genesis 24:11); but Genesis 29:7 tells us Rachael was at her well at an unusual time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might have been any number of reasons besides being “loose” that might have resulted in her being alone at midday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachael, as the mother of Joseph, could be another unspoken witness, as she too suffered; first with infertility then she died while giving birth to Benjamin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t even know that this meeting took place in warm weather. McGee and others suggest this took place in late December, making the temperature during the warmest part of the day irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(right about now, if you’re thinking of counter arguments to defend why the Samaritan woman IS a loose woman, good! It means you’re thinking critically about it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They may have been journeying for six hours, depending on when the daybreak was. We can miss Jesus’ humanity. He got tired and hungry, just like the rest of us. “The Chosen” does a great job at portraying His humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sychar was either immediately adjacent to Shechem, or potentially it was an alternate name for Shechem itself. We talk about this more in our Shechem inSITES video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are relatively confident the site of Jacob’s well venerated today is historically accurate, even though it’s not directly stated in Genesis that Jacob did so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protestants tend to discount the concept of holy sites, but most of the rest of the world – other traditions within Christianity as well as other religions- has sites that are sacred to their faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph: What a normal reader might miss is, as Lizorkin phrases it, a silent witness is present for this discussion: the bones of Joseph.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman’s life of suffering parallels Joseph’s in many respects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as Joseph’s suffering brought salvation to Israel, so will the woman’s suffering ultimately bring salvation to the Samaritans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If she’s alone at the well because she’s excluded from society, later we’re going to see that she’s actually not excluded from society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems unlikely that such a woman would have gone in bragging that she met someone who told her all she ever did and that causes the entire village to turn to Jesus; but we’ll get to that in due time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is more likely that by mentioning the time of day, John intended for us to contrast Nicodemus coming at night versus draw some conclusion about the woman’s morals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we do know is a man asking for a drink from a woman, not his wife, was highly irregular; Keener suggests it could have been interpreted as flirting with her although based on her responses, it doesn’t seem that she interpreted it this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true that well encounters between a male and a female sometimes led to marriage (e.g. Gen 24); if that is the type being employed here, Jesus would be talking about our supernatural marriage to Him; not a physical marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that this is a tradition or a societal norm Jesus is supposedly violating, not a commandment in the Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s breaking down man’s walls and divisions, not violating God’s standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus could not have violated any commandments and still legitimately claimed to be the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are at least three norms Jesus is breaking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking with an unmarried woman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associating with a sworn enemy of the Jews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Touching something His culture (but not the Bible) defined as “unclean,” including dining with Samaritans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus comes to her empty handed and needs her help&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bailey: “Jesus humbles himself and need her (help). Jesus does not establish the relationship by explaining how she needs Him and His message. That will come later.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-49-the-woman-appears-startled-by-the-breach-of-etiquette&#34;&gt;John 4:9 The Woman appears startled by the breach of etiquette&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the Samaritan woman said to Him, “How is it that You, though You are a Ioudaios, are asking me for a drink, though I am a Samaritan woman?” (For Ioudaioi do not associate with Samaritans.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image5.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.35in&#34; alt=&#34;A picture containing person, people, group, crowd Description automatically generated&#34; /&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning stages of this drama, they’re dancing around each other like two boxers might. Neither one is directly responding to the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be hard for us to be vulnerable, particularly to a stranger. Small talk is much safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman is, understandably, fixated on the NUMEROUS differences between herself and this Jewish stranger by the well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She knows that Jews would consider her waterpot unclean&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NIV has a footnote for “do not associate” as “do not use dishes Samaritans have used.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again a macro-narrative in John – the Jewish leadership refuses to acknowledge Jesus’ Jewishness; yet many others do, including Pilate in John 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did she know he was Jewish?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably because he dressed like one; most likely, this included a tallit, which somehow was different from the garments of Samaritans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He probably had an accent which though Galilean, would have set Him apart as a Jew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we imagine Jesus looked, talked, and dressed like a traditional Jew or is he a blond haired, blue eyed Jesus? In other words, do we make God in our image?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Talmud records that Jews consider Samaritans unclean and whatever they touch is unclean. Likely the reverse is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words on the page probably do not adequately capture the fact that she has to be absolutely stunned by this conversation; and it’s just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even a Samaritan waterpot is unclean to Jews – Believe it or not the pot has a critical supporting actor role in this drama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-410-mayim-chayim&#34;&gt;John 4:10: Mayim Chayim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus replied to her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who is saying to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image6.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:4.40745in;height:6.63943in&#34; alt=&#34;A waterfall in a forest Description automatically generated with low confidence&#34; /&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus/John continue the macro-narrative of natural water versus the Spirit, here called mayim chayiim, living water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This started in chapter 1 with Jesus’ water baptism and the spirit descending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In chapter 2 we had the ceremonial water, mystically turn to wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In chapter 3, Nicodemus was told he had to be born of the spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In chapter 5, the man will seek physical healing from the waters of Bethesda but Jesus will heal both physically and spiritually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jewish thought, Mayim Chayim was free-flowing fresh water untouched by human hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you filled your swim’pool (as they say in Texas) with rainwater, it would be Mayim Chayim; if you filled it from a hose, it would not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well water was NOT Mayim Chayim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is taking the concept and expanding it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think of “living water” as eternal life but Jesus is likely referring both to His teaching as well as spiritual regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically Jesus is not saying he IS the Mayim Chayim; He must give it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This appears to be a similar statement to telling Nicodemus he must be born again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, a tease, or cryptic introduction not intended to be immediately understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-411-12-are-you-greater-than-jacob&#34;&gt;John 4:11-12 Are you greater than Jacob?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said to Him, “Sir, You have no bucket and the well is deep; where then do You get this living water? “You are not greater than our father Jacob, are You, who gave us the well and drank of it himself, and his sons and his cattle?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image7.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.875in&#34; alt=&#34;A picture containing rock, stone, building material Description automatically generated&#34; /&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alternate-view&#34;&gt;Alternate view&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is often described as the woman mocking Jesus’ perceived inability to provide a drop of water, let alone this “living water.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samaritan or no, I believe it highly unlikely a woman would have spoken this way to a man in that culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to be careful about reading things like sarcasm into the text; we do not have any clue as to tone, voice inflection, or body language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer might say “objection; calls for speculation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background-1&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This appears to be a parallel to Nicodemus’ statement “how can one be born when He is old?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the woman is clueless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we don’t give her enough credit for being spiritually sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus sought her out and He does not cast his pearls before swine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waterpot plot thickens. Here she believes she has something Jesus does not, possibly symbolic of her view that Samaritans are superior to Jews. Watch what happens to her pot by the end of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the reference to Jacob; both sides claimed authority from their lineage from Jacob (just as Jews, Muslims, and Christians each draw authority from Abraham).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s possible she’s asserting Samaritan superiority with this comment, reminding her Jewish visitor that the patriarchs were in Shechem constantly, whereas Jerusalem is only indirectly mentioned in the Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster sees this as her now catching on to the fact that Jesus was hinting at something supernatural.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus of course is greater than Jacob, just as He is greater than Abraham and Moses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-413-14&#34;&gt;John 4:13-14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus answered and said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again; but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never be thirsty; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alternate-view-1&#34;&gt;Alternate view&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many commentators see this as a sharply worded rebuke of the woman’s repeated insolence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to read this as a plain statement, just as with Nicodemus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either case, Jesus is highlighting her deficiency; which was the same as our deficiency before we came into a relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-415&#34;&gt;John 4:15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 The woman said to Him, “Sir, give me this water so that I will not be thirsty, nor come all the way here to draw water.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternate view: Many commentators see her as scoffing, but I see nothing in the text that supports this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps she is thinking he’s talking about a limitless supply of literal water; at this point I doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see her as curious, wanting to know more, but not fully understanding, or perhaps responding with hyperbole (Like Nicodemus’ “reenter the womb” question).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s inviting Jesus to elaborate – remember her question that’s on the table: “Are you greater than our father Jacob?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-416-19&#34;&gt;John 4:16-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 He said to her, “Go, call your husband and come here.” The woman answered and said to Him, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You have correctly said, ‘I have no husband’; for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; this which you have said is true.” The woman said to Him, “Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alternate&#34;&gt;Alternate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main question for us is: Is Jesus sharply rebuking the woman and calling out her sin for the world to see, or perhaps is he saying he knows all about her pain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which would be the more consistent behavior from Jesus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there another location where he calls out a broken sinner and “nails her to the cross of justice,” as commentators suggest He is doing with the Samaritan woman?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He calls out people who claim to be following the truth but aren’t living like it – the Samaritan woman is not in this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is she rudely trying to change the subject, or could she be taking it all in and factually stating that only a prophet (remember, Samaritans didn’t believe in any prophet besides Moses) would know such things and is now on board with the spiritual discussion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it. If some stranger had exposed your sin, wouldn’t you say “ok then. I ‘ll see you around.” I would. She didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being Bereans, how else might we interpret “five husbands?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Husbands die (Ruth remarried for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the men left her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachel connection to infertility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “man you have now” could be a relative because no one else will take her in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 5 “I &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;have&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; no man to help me” is obviously not sexual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying the fallen woman premise is wrong; I’m saying I don’t know. Since I don’t know, I refuse to assume the worst about her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if Jesus is actually saying: “In answer to your question, yes; I am greater than Jacob. I am the God who sees you (Genesis 16). I know all about you and the pain you have endured. You think I’m Jewish so I don’t care about you because you’re a Samaritan, but I do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background-2&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Go call your husband” sounds like “go to my brothers” (John 20:17). A woman will become a witness to a man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, “in answer to your question, yes; I am greater than Jacob. I know all about you and the pain you have endured. You think I’m Jewish so I don’t care, but I do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by the way, this could have been Jesus’ intent even if we assume she was sexually promiscuous - .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to paraphrase the “prophet” comment: “Ok you are greater than Jacob, but are you who I think you are?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think in the back of her mind, she’s wondering if this is the Samaritan Messiah but things aren’t adding up…not yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For still another interpretation, Dobson notes, “Josephus claimed Samaritans worshipped five gods as their ancestors had (see 2 Kings 17:24-34)”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; while claiming allegiance to the one true god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five husbands = five false gods&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One you have now = The god you’re worshipping now, the one you claim to be the God of Israel, isn’t the TRUE God of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, if this theory is true, then the transition to the mountain discussion is seamless and not a change of subject at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 17:11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-420-21-which-mountain&#34;&gt;John 4:20-21: Which mountain?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and yet you Ioudaioi say that in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship.” Jesus said to her, “Believe Me, woman, that a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image8.emf&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:3.65625in&#34; /&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alternate-view-2&#34;&gt;Alternate View&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IF she rudely changes the subject, Jesus does not seem to care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Jesus doesn’t seem to mind, I don’t see why we should make a big deal of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He engages with her in this theological discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume the traditional interpretation that she burned through her husbands because she had loose morals. Don’t you and I have things in our past that we’re not proud of? Jesus is moving on from that to talk about something much more important; a proper relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background-3&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This mountain” = Mt. Gerizim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mt. Gerizim is another silent witness, the mount of blessings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus and the woman could have seen mount Gerizim as they talked&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy studying holy land geography, but this verse is a reminder that we don’t venerate sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biblical sites are signs that point to God and give us insights into His word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we talked about in our Samaritans video, Mt. Gerizim vs Mt. Zion was symbolic of the friction between Samaritans and Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competing holy sites is fairly common; even protestants get in on the action with the Garden Tomb versus the Catholic/Orthodox Church of the Holy Sepulcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that Jesus LOVES Jerusalem,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is about to affirm the Jewish position, which includes a body of Scripture with hundreds of verses on the sanctity of Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should not read any type of Replacement Theology interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He may be foreseeing the destruction in AD 70, but this is not the same as saying Jerusalem is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-422-24--salvation-is-from-the-ioudaioi&#34;&gt;John 4:22-24 – Salvation is from the Ioudaioi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, because salvation is from the Ioudaioi. “But a time is coming, and even now has arrived, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers. “God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image9.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.32153in&#34; /&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salvation from the Ioudaioi is a striking statement given how often Ioudaioi are painted negatively in John’s gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is endorsing the Jewish side of the argument, but, in his internal discussions with other Jews, He has many issues with the practice of the Jewish faith and how it strayed far from what God intended. Don’t get smug: He does that with 5/7 churches in Revelation – instead of man-made practices creeping in over hundreds of years, the late first Century church was only about 60 years removed from Jesus ministry – and they were still straying off course. How much more so are we at risk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being “mostly scriptural” is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because you say you worship the God of Israel, doesn’t mean you actually are – remember the scary phrase “depart from me, I never knew you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was probably as stunned by this statement as Nicodemus was when he was told to be born again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her mind, Jesus’ answer is impossible; there is a third mountain: Mt. Gerezim; Mt. Zion, and the Mt. of Spirit and Truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was caught in a false dichotomy, believing that there are only two choices, and only one of those is the right one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be a rabbit trail to discuss the false dichotomies the world tries to present us with and make us choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to seek Jesus’ way. He isn’t interested in winning arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener: Jesus establishes “the correctness of the Jewish position, although He does not allow that to remain as an ultimate barrier to reconciliation.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is laying the foundation for other non-Jews, i.e. gentiles, to be grafted-in to the correct ways of the Ioudaioi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A time is coming: the fulfillment of the Messianic kingdom is still future;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A time now is: events to inaugurate the Messianic kingdom are in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-425-26-youre-the-messiah-arent-you&#34;&gt;John 4:25-26: You’re the Messiah, aren’t You?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman said to Him, “I know that Messiah is coming (He who is called Christ); when that One comes, He will declare all things to us.” Jesus said to her, “I am He, the One speaking to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster suspects she may be politely trying to end the conversation here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement reminds me of Nicodemus saying “Rabbi, we know you have come from God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as I saw Nicodemus asking Jesus to confirm whether He was the Messiah, I think the woman is possibly doing the same thing here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re the Messiah, aren’t you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus answers with an emphatic yes with one of John’s famous “I am” statements in John that establish Jesus as the great I AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Samaritans reject the books we categorize as “the prophets,” she had to draw this conclusion from the Torah only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since they both shared the Torah, Messiah thus is a shared concept between Jews and Samaritans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One view of the Samaritan Taheb is that of a “restorer.” They interpret it as their Messiah will restore Samaritan preeminence. Jesus is a completely different kind of restorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;10-i-am-statements-in-john&#34;&gt;10 I AM statements in John&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 4:26 – I AM He (the Messiah)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 6:35 – I AM the Bread of Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 8:12 – I AM the Light of the World&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 8:58 – Before Abraham was, I AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 10:7 – I AM the gate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 10:11 – I AM the Good Shepherd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 11:25 – I AM the Resurrection and the Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 14:6 – I AM the Way, Truth, Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 15:1 – I AM the True Vine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 18:5 – I AM He (Yeshua of Nazareth)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-427-disciples-amazed-at-the-breach-of-protocol&#34;&gt;John 4:27: Disciples amazed at the Breach of Protocol&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at this point, His disciples came, and they were amazed that He had been speaking with a woman, yet no one said, “What are You seeking?” or, “Why are You speaking with her?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a few points, John gives a clue to what the disciples were thinking (or at least what &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; was thinking) but not saying at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 21 is another example: “none of them dared ask who it was; they knew it was the LORD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understandably they were shocked by this apparent breach of protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text says they were surprised at His speaking with a woman; they were probably equally surprised that He was speaking with a Samaritan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-428-30-leaving-your-waterpot-behind&#34;&gt;John 4:28-30: Leaving your waterpot behind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the woman left her waterpot and went into the city, and said to the people, “Come, see a Man who told me all the things that I have done; this is not the Christ, is He?” They left the city and were coming to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;waterpot-left&#34;&gt;Waterpot left&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image10.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.875in&#34; alt=&#34;A picture containing dirty, stone, kitchen appliance Description automatically generated&#34; /&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to read a story and ask, “why is that there?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bit about the waterpot seems irrelevant – if the text had said, “so the woman went into the city and said…,” we wouldn’t think anything of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned above, the waterpot was symbolic of the divide between Jews and Samaritans. She’s leaving that behind (literally and figuratively at Jesus’ feet) in addition to her former life of pain and misery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ living water has replaced the water of Jacob’s well.” – Keener&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the waterpot that you need to leave behind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walking In His Dust&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Talmidim leave our pain and brokenness at Jesus’ feet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colossians 1:13-14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For He &lt;strong&gt;rescued&lt;/strong&gt; us from the domain of darkness, and &lt;strong&gt;transferred&lt;/strong&gt; us to the kingdom of His beloved Son, in whom we have &lt;strong&gt;redemption&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;forgiveness&lt;/strong&gt; of sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alternate-view-3&#34;&gt;Alternate View&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This verse is critical to our alternate hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we already have a preconceived notion about the woman, then we probably read “everything I ever did” as a list of her sinful acts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fallen woman probably would not brag about someone exposing a list of her sinful acts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The townsfolk likely would not care what a fallen woman said, yet they respond to her invitation. In general, the testimony of a woman was not well regarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One commentator suggests that she went to the men of the town and not the women because she’d had sex with all the men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is there no support in the Bible for this position, but it also betrays a heart filled with negativity, cynicism, and condemnation of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us not be like this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus a nuance of “He knows everything about me,” seems to fit the context better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John arranged this to intentionally follow John 3:16 – God So loved the world. Salvation is from the Jews but salvation is not limited to Jewish people (neither are they excluded)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chapter demonstrates the difficulty in interpreting a Bible passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re thousands of years and thousands of miles away from when and where these events happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lizorkin: “We bring our past, our preconceived notions, our already formed theology, our cultural blind spots, our social standing, our gender, our political views and many other influences to our interpretation.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we challenge popular commentaries it’s not about being contrarian as much as it is an attempt to enrich our understanding by gaining a different perspective, similar to viewing a work of art from an angle as opposed to directly in front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also not personal to anyone who holds these views, most of whom are smarter and more spiritual than I will ever be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bereans receive teaching and search the scriptures to see whether these things be so. If we simply accept a given interpretation without grappling with it, we aren’t being good Bereans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus knocked down much bigger walls than Joshua did when He entered Samaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keener: “Jesus crosses strict cultural boundaries separating races, genders, and moral status, pointing to the new and ultimate unity in the Spirit. (What he did) would be roughly equivalent to defying segregation in the United States during the 1950s…shocking, extremely difficult, somewhat dangerous. The Jesus of the Gospels is more concerned with people than with custom.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amos 9:11-15 speaks of eventual restoration of the Tent of David, meaning a time when the nation was united north/Israel and south/Judah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll pick up next time with a phrase that is mentioned in all four gospels: “A prophet has no honor in his own hometown.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In A PROPHET WITHOUT HONOR, we leave the village of Cana and follow Yeshua back to Nazareth to spend a quiet Shabbat in His hometown. The view from atop the Nazareth hill affords us a splendid view of the Jezreel Valley, Mount Tabor, and the surrounding territory. Take a walk around town and take in the sights as the shops close and people prepare for Sabbath. This is where our Master grew up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue in John 4, where the woman has left her waterpot at Jesus&amp;rsquo; feet as she ran back into town, claiming to have met someone who knows all about her. The disciples returned with food and were curious as to why Jesus was speaking alone with a Samaritan woman, but no one said anything. A talmid’s job is to model and imitate his rav/teacher, so I’m sure the disciples were wondering how far they were supposed to take this “interaction with Samaritans” thing. Jesus will tell them once we get to Luke 10. Everyone is our neighbor, and we’re supposed to love our neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this mini discourse on food, Jesus will stay in Samaria for a couple of days and then head back to Nazareth. We’ll pick up the narrative in Luke 4, where He is asked to teach on Shabbat in Nazareth. He proclaims Himself the Messiah, which signals a transition from a private to a public phase of His ministry. The people of Nazareth reject this as blasphemy. He somehow avoids a mob that wants to stone him and relocates to Capernaum to launch his public Galilean ministry. What happens there will fulfill the saying, “A prophet is without honor in his hometown.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have one more episode in what we categorize as Jesus’ “early ministry.” Next time, we will pick up John 5 in Jerusalem; after this, we’ll return to Capernaum and formally enter the next phase of Jesus’ earthly ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:4.125in;height:5.83333in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.06528in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schlaegel, in his supplemental study guide for the Satellite Bible Atlas, writes, “Neither war nor diplomacy over hundreds of years was able to break down the barriers between Jews and Samaritans. The Gospel of Jesus Christ did. Many Samaritans in the city believed in him (John 4:39-42).”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we say this period closes Jesus’ private ministry, Jesus had been growing in popularity when He returned to Galilee. Word of His private miracles was spreading and many people reported what Jesus had been doing in Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an official from Capernaum heard that Jesus had returned to Galilee, he came up to Cana to plead with Jesus to heal his son. With a word, Jesus healed the boy from some 18 miles away. After this, or perhaps immediately before this, Jesus is in Nazareth, where He is rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-431-34&#34;&gt;John 4:31-34&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the disciples urged Him, saying, “Rabbi, eat something.” But He said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.” So the disciples were saying to one another, “No one brought Him anything to eat, did he?” Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to accomplish His work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see, perhaps, a paradox. We opened John 4 with Jesus being tired and thirsty – we noted that ministry could be exhausting. While we can get exhausted by the ministry, it can also be incredibly nourishing and fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must recall His statement in the wilderness: “Man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:4.45161in;height:5.93548in&#34; alt=&#34;A picture containing person, cooking, meal, grill Description automatically generated&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:3.8735in;height:3.77501in&#34; alt=&#34;A person sitting at a table Description automatically generated with medium confidence&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These photos are from a demonstration of 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century food preparation techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One good suggestion is that when Jesus is on the Father’s mission, He is just as nourished and strengthened as if he had literal food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we go on mission trips, we start with the intent to bless others (and hopefully that does happen), but most of us return feeling like we were the ones blessed and spiritually nourished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus makes statements like, “do the will of Him who sent me to accomplish His work,” we tend to see this as His work on the Cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is correct. Jesus will ultimately accomplish His Father’s work on the Cross – “It is finished” could be translated as “it is fulfilled” or “it is accomplished.” Tetelestai means “paid in full.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do need to keep the context in mind, however. He has not yet said anything about going to the Cross, so his Talmidim would not have interpreted Jesus’ statement as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the near term, the Father’s Work includes Jesus’ teaching, healing, compassion, and breaking down barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the talmidim are a picture of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Samaritan woman misunderstands His comment about water and she just met him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talmidim have been with Him for months now, and they are still misunderstanding him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the fun of our Christian walk is that we will never have Jesus completely figured out this side of Heaven. Every time we open His word, there is usually a new insight or aspect to Jesus we may not have noticed before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, Food and water are metaphors for spiritual truth&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water speaks of the need for salvation and regeneration in the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food represents doing the will of God – in other words, everything that comes after the moment of initial regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-435-38&#34;&gt;John 4:35-38&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you not say, ‘There are still four months, and then comes the harvest’? Behold, I tell you, raise your eyes and observe the fields, that they are white for harvest. “Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life, so that the one who sows and the one who reaps may rejoice together. “For in this case the saying is true: ‘One sows and another reaps.’ “I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have come into their labor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We harvest grain so we can have literal food; we sow and reap the Kingdom for spiritual nourishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Still four months until the harvest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some see this as Jesus literally saying there are only four months until the harvest, and therefore this episode takes place in late December or early January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be an odd time of year for a trip through the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so, it pokes a huge hole in the “heat of the day” argument about the woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, who often used crop and harvest metaphors, may have been quoting a regional proverb not otherwise known to us today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, we have the proverb, “April showers bring May flowers.” This could refer to literal rain in the month of April, resulting in literal flowers, or the general truism that every action has a reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus may be saying something like, “these fields of Samaria look bare to you because of your prejudice. You don’t see the Samaritans as worth saving. From my perspective, they are ripe for harvest. For God so loved the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lift up your eyes” often has a negative connotation in Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Jesus is turning it around to possibly suggest His talmidim are blind to the mission field right in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there was a sense among the talmidim that the time for harvest was not upon them – the sense that the harvest will only immediately precede the Messianic Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they did not consider Samaritans as being eligible for harvest into the Kingdom. They are unreachable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there “no go zones” in your ministry? By your words you may say there aren’t, but do your actions suggest certain people are unreachable for the Gospel? Be honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fields white for harvest could refer to the Samaritans approaching in their white robes – even today, the Samaritan priests typically wear white, with colors reserved for those in leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibly, Jesus could be saying, “I sowed in the Samaritan woman, and she sowed in her town – we did the heavy lifting; now you take over.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster’s explanation:&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sower = John the Baptist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaper = Jesus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers – the Talmidim&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time of the harvest = the present moment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fields are ripe = some are ready to receive the kingdom (such as the Samaritans here)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning: The harvest of souls for the kingdom begins now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-439&#34;&gt;John 4:39&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now from that city many of the Samaritans believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified, “He told me all the things that I have done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked about this last lesson but just to make the point again- if someone had just exposed every bad thing a person ever did, would you drop everything to meet that person, or would you run in the opposite direction for fear He might expose your sins next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chosen,&lt;/em&gt; while still implying she was a morally fallen woman, handled this passage very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the woman’s supposed snootiness or Jesus supposed sternness that most commentators love to imply was happening came through in their presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest we focus on Jesus’ love and compassion, and the woman’s restoration. And, of course, the disciples’ amazement that Samaritans are part of the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forget who said it but there’s a quip, “when you get to heaven, you will be surprised to see some people there who you thought were beyond God’s reach. Some people from your past may be surprised to see you for the same reason.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one is beyond God’s reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-440-42&#34;&gt;John 4:40-42&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when the Samaritans came to Jesus, they were asking Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days. Many more believed because of His word; and they were saying to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves and know that this One truly is the Savior of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Savior of the world” was a term used by Roman emperors to speak of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the sources of tension, and one that would continue after Jesus’ time, is the Samaritans tended to be pro-Roman against the Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like Herodium, the palace of the false king of the Jews was only a few miles from Bethlehem, the birthplace of the real king of the Jews; just a few miles from Jacob’s well was a temple to Augustus, “savior of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those Samaritans with open eyes, Jesus, not Augustus, was the true savior of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-443-45&#34;&gt;John 4:43-45&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image6.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:4.37129in;height:3.04496in&#34; alt=&#34;A picture containing outdoor, sky, nature, grass Description automatically generated&#34; /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after the two days, He departed from there for Galilee. For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country. So when He came to Galilee, the Galileans received Him, only because they had seen all the things that He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they themselves also went to the feast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could read the first four verses of chapter four and come away with the impression Jesus was in a hurry to get to Galilee. We find here that is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot going on here that is not stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purity customs (not from the Torah but man’s traditions) said that Jews and Samaritans considered each other unclean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With whom one lodged and dined was a BIG DEAL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be called a Rosa Parks moment in Jesus’ ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although all four Gospels use the phrase, “A prophet without honor,” the synoptics use it in reference to Nazareth, while John uses it in reference to Judea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of John’s macro-narratives is Jesus’ rejection by the Jewish leadership – the very ones who should have authenticated Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some commentators make a point that here and in verse 46, it says “He” and not “they” –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the implication is that the disciples went on ahead, possibly because they couldn’t stomach (literally and figuratively) dining with Samaritans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a speculation that I don’t necessarily see but I can’t rule out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t know for sure that Jesus was left behind, but if He was, there could have been any number of reasons why. We aren’t told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we’re following a strict chronology, the disciples have not yet been called to full-time ministry, so perhaps many of the disciples had jobs and families to attend to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-446-49&#34;&gt;John 4:46-49&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore He came again to Cana of Galilee, where He had made the water into wine. And there was a royal official whose son was sick at Capernaum. When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and began asking Him to come down and heal his son; for he was at the point of death. Then Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you simply will not believe.” The royal official said to Him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is evidently trying to keep a low profile but His fame is spreading. People who went to the Passover in Jerusalem came back with stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy for us to say something like, “the Jews rejected their messiah.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationally, this is true and certainly, the Jewish establishment rejected Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Jesus was WILDLY POPULAR among the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, some of these were fair-weather fans only; some were followers and some were actually disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons the establishment wanted Jesus taken out was because of his popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The royal official is unnamed but appears to be someone in Antipas’ administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we move through Jesus’ ministry, take a note of who is and is not Jewish; this is important to understanding Jesus’ messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This official appears to be Jewish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, someone who was with Jesus in Judea went back to Capernaum and told the official what he needed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial rebuff is reminiscent of Jesus’ words to Mary in John 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public phase of His ministry has not yet started; not officially, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus uses the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; person plural in His rebuff, so perhaps the remark is not directed to the official but more to the people who wanted some entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-450-54&#34;&gt;John 4:50-54&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to him, “Go; your son is alive.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went home. And as he was now going down, his slaves met him, saying that his son was alive. So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. Then they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.” So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, “Your son is alive”; and he himself believed, and his entire household. This is again a second sign that Jesus performed when He had come from Judea into Galilee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-distance miracles suggest extraordinary power. “Jesus’ only prerequisite for such miracles is the seeker’s faith in His power.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commentators note that this story sounds similar to the healing of the Centurian’s servant in Luke 7. While some suggest the two events are one and the same, there are enough differences in the two narratives to suggest two separate healings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 54: “ this was a second time that Jesus came from Judea to the Galilee and performed a miracle.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John is obviously linking us back to John 2:11 and the first miracle at Cana.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-413-15&#34;&gt;Luke 4:13-15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so when the devil had finished every temptation, he left Him until an opportune time. And Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about Him spread through all the surrounding region. And He began teaching in their synagogues and was praised by all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke places the Nazareth event immediately after Jesus’ temptation in the Wilderness, though possibly an entire year elapsed between the Wilderness and Nazareth.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Was praised by all” is going to serve as a contrast to his reaction in Nazareth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He regularly attended synagogue services and taught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 16 is going to say, “as was His custom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hebrews 10:24 reminds us not to forsake the gathering together of believers. Jesus modeled this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did not come to dismantle synagogue services or Judaism but to bring a course correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster notes that 1st-century synagogues, unlike Jewish and Christian congregations today, did not have a single permanent teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any competent teacher in the community or visiting rabbi might be asked to offer a Sabbath teaching.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-416&#34;&gt;Luke 4:16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mat 13:54&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark 6:1-2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luke 4:16&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And He came to His hometown and began teaching them in their synagogue, with the result that they were astonished, and said, “Where did this man acquire this wisdom and these miraculous powers?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jesus went out from there and came into His hometown; and His disciples followed Him. And when the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue; and the many listeners were astonished, saying, “Where did this Man learn these things, and what is this wisdom that has been given to Him, and such miracles as these performed by His hands?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16 And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up; and as was His custom, He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath, and stood up to read.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew, if he’s attempting to be chronological, has it roughly halfway through His gospel (but He’s probably not attempting to be chronological).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some reconciliations would see a second visit to Nazareth – the first recorded by Luke and the second by Matthew and Mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Luke was likely referencing Matthew and Mark (at least Mark) as he wrote, along with his own interviews and research, a single visit early in Jesus’ ministry seems more probable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe the residents of Nazareth were all descendants of David; if so, it makes their subsequent rejection all the more puzzling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nazareth means “branch town,” from Isaiah 11:1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 11:1-2 Then a shoot will spring from the stem of Jesse, And a Branch from his roots will bear fruit. [2] The Spirit of the LORD will rest on Him, The spirit of wisdom and understanding, The spirit of counsel and strength, The spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a decidedly messianic prophecy; in other words, the entire town was founded on the hope that the Messiah would one day come from Nazareth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet when that time came, they rejected the notion that one of their own could be the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’re criticizing them (justifiably so) let us examine ourselves; would we have been any different?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-417-20&#34;&gt;Luke 4:17-20&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image7.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.875in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the scroll of Isaiah the prophet was handed to Him. And He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written: “THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME, BECAUSE HE ANOINTED ME TO BRING GOOD NEWS TO THE POOR. HE HAS SENT ME TO PROCLAIM RELEASE TO CAPTIVES, AND RECOVERY OF SIGHT TO THE BLIND, TO SET FREE THOSE WHO ARE OPPRESSED, TO PROCLAIM THE FAVORABLE YEAR OF THE LORD.” And He rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down; and the eyes of all the people in the synagogue were intently directed at Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 61:1-2 The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, Because the LORD anointed me To bring good news to the humble; He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, To proclaim release to captives And freedom to prisoners; To proclaim the favorable year of the LORD &lt;strong&gt;And the day of vengeance of our God;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone in attendance would have had Isaiah 61 memorized; it would have been conspicuous for him to leave out, “and the day of vengeance of our God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? In retrospect, we can see that in His first coming, He did not come to condemn the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If He had said, “the day of vengeance of our God,” He could not have said, “today, this scripture has been fulfilled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audience in that day would not yet have been able to make that conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless He explained why He left out the verse (as He does in The Chosen’s approach to the scene), the audience might have been &lt;em&gt;momentarily&lt;/em&gt; wondering why He did this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any concerns were about to be overshadowed by what He WOULD say next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image7.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.875in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torah reading in Synagogues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synagogue tradition today is to read through the Torah in one Jewish year (50-54 weeks); however, we don’t know if this was the case 2000 years ago. Some suggest they were on a three-year cycle. After the Torah was read, a portion from the Prophets and Writings called the Haftarah was read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was reading the Haftarah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that day, the lecturer stood to read the Torah and Haftarah, then sat to teach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know the Sabbath service in the first century included the above three elements (&lt;em&gt;Torah, haftarah, derashah).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 13:15 After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue officials sent word to them, saying, “Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is not recorded, Messianic commentators assume Jesus also read the designated Torah portion that Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not know whether He picked Isaiah or whether it was assigned to Him&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In modern Torah reading annual cycles, the Haftara portion is assigned and is the same for that week’s portion every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t know whether this was the case in Jesus’ day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We suspect either way it was not a surprise to Him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each section of the Isaiah passage is rich with Messianic overtones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, “the acceptable/favorable year of the LORD” appears to be a reference to the year of Jubilee. A year the slaves were set free, debts were cancelled and leased property reverted back to its owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus came to cancel our spiritual debts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-421&#34;&gt;Luke 4:21&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now He began to say to them, “Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He possibly had part of a longer message where He either began or ended with our verse 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s unquestionably claiming to be the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t miss that we’ve just entered new territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lesson could just as easily have been the opening of Jesus’ public Galilean ministry as the close of His private early ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t quite sure where John 5 falls in the chronology, so we’ll cover that next time and group in with His early ministry. That chapter is John’s version of Jesus’ transition from private missions to publicly declaring who He is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-422-24&#34;&gt;Luke 4:22-24&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Matthew 13&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Mark 6&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luke 4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;55 “Is this not the carpenter’s son? Is His mother not called Mary, and His brothers, James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;56 “And His sisters, are they not all with us? Where then did this Man acquire all these things?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;57 And they took offense at Him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not dishonored except in his hometown and in his own household.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;58 And He did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 “Is this not the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And are His sisters not here with us?” And they took offense at Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not dishonored except in his hometown and among his own relatives, and in his own household.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 And He could not do any miracle there except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 And He was amazed at their unbelief. And He was going around the villages, teaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And all the people were speaking well of Him, and admiring the gracious words which were coming from His lips; and yet they were saying, “Is this not Joseph’s son?” And He said to them, “No doubt you will quote this proverb to Me: ‘Physician, heal yourself! All the miracles that we heard were done in Capernaum, do here in Your hometown as well.’” But He said, “Truly I say to you, no prophet is welcome in his hometown.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked about whether the turning of the money changer’s tables in the Temple in John was the first of two or whether it only happened at the end of his ministry but John placed it early for a specific reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One argument in favor of there only being one event is that it might be unlikely for Jesus to “poke the bear” that early in His ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my view, NOW He’s about to “poke the bear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this instant, they are probably hanging on his every word but they still are inclined to view Him favorably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s about to change and He knows it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fairness, we don’t know with certainty if the people in the audience entirely turned on Him or if there was a mix of supporters and detractors. The latter seems more likely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If count carefully, there are seven different reactions recorded across the three Gospels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where did this man get these things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s this wisdom that has been given Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where did this man get the power to do miracles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this not Joseph’s son?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this not the carpenter (himself)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this not Mary’s son and his brothers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are not his sisters here with us? (testimony of women?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first three questions are positive/accepting; the last three are negative/dismissive of His abilities.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One might expect this Davidic clan living in the hope of a hometown Messiah to be the first to acclaim that their own Yeshua son of Joseph as Messiah. On the contrary…He was just good-old Yeshua, the carpenter’s son.” Lancaster.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David was also rejected/dismissed by his father and brothers. “When Samuel anointed David, Jesse and David’s brothers were stunned.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heal-thyself&#34;&gt;Heal Thyself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same maxim is quoted in the Jewish Midrash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means “prove your claims.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jesus-family&#34;&gt;Jesus’ family&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We speculate that Joseph has since died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had Joseph remained alive, Jesus (given His obvious skills as demonstrated when He was 12) might have been able to complete Beit Midrash and Beit Talmud to study under a prominent Sage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is, out of necessity and as the firstborn, He likely had to assume the role of family provider, which meant taking over His father’s carpentry/masonry business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, that’s all the townfolk saw Him as.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Matthew 13, Jesus was the oldest of at least seven children (Jesus, four brothers, and at least two sisters).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to preserve the tradition of Mary’s perpetual virginity, some suggest that the other children are children of Joseph by another wife or are actually cousins, not siblings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving tradition aside, reading all as children of Mary, with everyone after Jesus conceived in the usual manner, is supported by a plain reading of the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The names provided are all common Jewish names, and ones that are shared by several disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 7:5 helps us out a little as we’re told none of Jesus’s brothers believed in Him until after the resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have evidence suggesting James (Yakov in Hebrew) was a Pharisee. If so, James had the opportunity for formal schooling that Jesus did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the resurrection, James became the head of the Jerusalem assembly of believers, even to the point of having apostolic authority over the original disciples (including Peter, which must have been a fascinating dynamic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He appears to be well-regarded, even among the non-messianic Jews. He has the nickname James the Just, or we might say James the Righteous/Tzadik. The only way he would have earned this nickname is from strict Torah observance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This James is the author of the book of James and should not be confused with the two Apostles named James (James the Less (Mark 15:40) or James son of Alphaeus (Matthew 10:3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judas (Jude)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this is not the same as Judas who betrayed Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ brother Judas authored the book we know as Jude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon and Joseph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Simon is not Peter nor Simon the Zealot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Joseph is not the Joses mentioned in Mark 15:40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church tradition ascribes varying roles to Jesus’ brothers and sisters, but we have no other corroborating documentation to either support or refute this tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-425-28&#34;&gt;Luke 4:25-28&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25 “But I say to you in truth, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, when a severe famine came over all the land;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;26 and yet Elijah was sent to none of them, but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27 “And there were many with leprosy in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;28 And all the people in the synagogue were filled with rage as they heard these things;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus quotes a couple of miracles performed by Elijah and Elisha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Kings 17:9 “Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and stay there; behold, I have commanded a widow there to provide food for you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Kings 5:14 So (Naaman) went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, in accordance with the word of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is an entertaining story and worth our study. 2 Kings 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may not see what the big deal is, but as Chuck Missler liked to say, whenever you and I are in danger of missing something, the people come to our rescue. They are enraged and it’s our task to find out why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some commentators see the problem is he’s mentioning the socially weak and marginalized, which offended the sensibilities of the town. That’s not it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s saying, actually prophesying, that Gentiles receive the things of God and Jews do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just as Elijah and Elisha did not heal everyone, neither did Jesus heal everyone who needed it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some commentators interpret this as Jesus casting off Jews and Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably know me well enough by now to realize that, in my humble opinion, this is not how to read this passage appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire focus of the upcoming segment of His ministry is going to be to the Jews and ONLY the Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will tell His disciples, “do NOT go in way of the gentiles…rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel” (Matthew 10-5-6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All He’s doing here is explaining that He will leave Nazareth and take His ministry elsewhere; specifically, He will take it to the JEWISH town of Capernaum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What He WAS doing was comparing Himself to two of Israel’s greatest prophets, and in so doing, comparing Nazareth to the likes of idolatrous Ahab and Jezebel, who rejected and tried to kill the prophets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rough paraphrase might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surely some of you will tell Me to prove my claims of being Messiah by the signs and miracles you have heard me do in other places. Just as Elisha and Elijah did not do these miracles for everybody, you Nazarenes are not worthy of My miracles. I’m out.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-429-30&#34;&gt;Luke 4:29-30&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and they got up and drove Him out of the city, and brought Him to the crest of the hill on which their city had been built, so that they could throw Him down from the cliff. But He passed through their midst and went on His way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image8.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.87361in&#34; alt=&#34;A picture containing outdoor, mountain, sky, nature Description automatically generated&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, even when Jews had the power of capital punishment (which at this time they did not) Jewish law required order and due process to criminal proceedings, particularly for a capital crime, such as blasphemy – and there is no chance an execution would have been allowed on Shabbat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of a lawless, nearly out of control mob, the Chosen elected to portray this scene as people serious about the Torah and about the Laws of Blasphemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chief Rabbi asked repeatedly for Jesus to recount His so-called “blasphemy”; When Jesus did not, the rabbi felt He had no choice under the law of Moses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I had always viewed it as an out-of-control mob I appreciated the lesson in keeping our options open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to revise my notes for this section after I watched the episode in Season 3. I’m Ok with that. I still lean towards the out-of-control mob angle, but I can entertain the other possibility too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should always be ready to update our conclusions when indicated. That’s being a good Berean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a coworker who liked to say, “we always reserve the right to get smarter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a Berean does not mean you have to accept everything anyone says, however. It has to fit Scripture and it has to fit the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as to avoid cruel and unusual punishment, the condemned would often be thrown from a cliff, with the thought that the numerous jagged rocks would at least render him unconscious, with the stones then thrown to finish him off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They would aim for the chest, not the head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the fall alone killed the person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was not necessarily the altitude of the fall but the fact one would lose his balance and be very likely to hit his head on a rock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that day, Nazareth was MUCH smaller than it is today; a walk to either the northern hill or far less likely the southern hill would have been a hike on a Sabbath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The southern hill is “venerated” by tour companies because it’s a low-hassle stop without going through Nazareth on the way to Capernaum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The views of the Jezreel valley are a spectacular place to remember Jesus’ declaration and remember the OT events in the historical books that happened right in front of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We presume it was something supernatural that saved Him but remember, He did no miracles there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could have been His poise or his attitude that silenced them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or He potentially had to tussle His way through the crowd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, His hour had not yet come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope for Nazareth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years following His resurrection, the people of Nazareth became fervent believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His brothers became leaders in the early Messianic Jewish movement and Nazareth appears to have been a center for Jewish believers.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even today, the Modern Hebrew word for “Christians” is “notzrim.” “Nazarenes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;13 and leaving Nazareth, He came and settled in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 This happened so that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 “THE LAND OF ZEBULUN AND THE LAND OF NAPHTALI, BY THE WAY OF THE SEA, ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE JORDAN, GALILEE OF THE GENTILES—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SITTING IN DARKNESS SAW A GREAT LIGHT, AND THOSE WHO WERE SITTING IN THE LAND AND SHADOW OF DEATH, UPON THEM A LIGHT DAWNED.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;31 And He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee; and He was teaching them on the Sabbath;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will pick this up two lessons from now when we get to Capernaum and Jesus public ministry. Next time we’ll have one more lesson in the “early ministry” category. John 5 and the Pools of Bethesda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the POOLS OF BETHESDA, we follow Yeshua as He makes another pilgrimage to Jerusalem to keep one of the festivals. On the Sabbath day, we head for the Temple. On the way there, we walk along the city walls and cut through the five-colonnaded double pool of Bethesda on our way to the Sheep Gate. Then we duck inside and up to the Temple to spend the rest of the day, where a delegation from the religious leaders in Judea reprimands Him for healing on the Sabbath. The ensuing discourse occurs within the Temple courts, but the discussion takes us from the carpenter shop in Nazareth to the end of the era, the resurrection of the dead, the Messianic Kingdom, and the final judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;contents&#34;&gt;Contents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was the unnamed feast of the Ioudaioi?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened to verse 3b and 4?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where and, more importantly, WHAT were these pools?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why were the Ioudaioi upset?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who were the THREE witnesses testifying on behalf of Jesus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:5.03611in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schlaegel’s introduction: “Jesus interrupted His ministry in Galilee (Map 11-5) when He came to Jerusalem for an unnamed festival. On a Sabbath at the Pools of Bethesda, Jesus healed a man who had been lame for 38 years. After nearly two thousand years of searching for these pools, they were finally excavated beginning in the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are located just north of the temple mount, near the remains of the Antonio fortress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now know that these pools were not associated with the Jewish temple whatsoever but with the Greco-Roman God of healing, Asclepius. So, we have a man, whom we later find out is Jewish, had ineffectually waited for years on a superstitious healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this discovery, we can confidently say that the description in some Greek manuscripts in John 5:3b-4 of an angel of the Lord stirring the waters is an &lt;strong&gt;incorrect&lt;/strong&gt; 4th century AD addition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Box E marks the pools of Bethesda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important geographic clue could like in the fact that although the pools today are inside the city walls, at the time of Jesus, they were outside the city walls. On this map, we can see that Gogaltha was also outside the walls. Despite the pool’s proximity to the Temple, we believe from archeology that these pools were actually pagan. The Greeks and Romans had pagan healing centers called Asclepions throughout the empire. The larges one was in the city of Pergamom, one of the seven churches of Revelation. You might want to check out the background video on Pergamom: &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/NcftNgsIHWw?t=569&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/NcftNgsIHWw?t=569&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.png&#34; style=&#34;width:4.42479in;height:5.23269in&#34; /&gt;Asclepius with Serpent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that these pools are pagan and not Jewish changes the entire complexity of the passage, which we will get into as the study unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the miracle, Jesus claimed to not only have the power to heal but to raise the dead.” In other words, Jesus is “greater than the healing sanctuaries of His day.” He is also greater than our medical system today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;transition&#34;&gt;Transition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like our previous lesson at the Nazareth synagogue represented a transition from private to public in Jesus’ Galilean ministry, this lesson represents a transition from private to public in His Judean ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, John, in reading the available manuscripts from the synoptic writers noticed a lack of detail on Jesus’ activities in Jerusalem prior to Passion week. In any case, John pays significantly more attention to Jesus’ activities in Judea than do Matthew, Mark, and Luke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we move into more public encounters, we should begin to be like stage directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the setting; where is He? Remote countryside? Galilean village? The big city of Jerusalem or its “suburbs”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are people seeking out Jesus or is He targeting someone for a specific interaction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is present, and who is not present? To be specific we need to say who is “documented as being present.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note whom Jesus interacts directly versus onlookers;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note who might be favorably disposed to Jesus’ message, who might be hostile and who might be on the fence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, note who is not mentioned. The disciples. Jesus went to the feast alone, or at least John did not mention the presence of any other friendlies accompanying Jesus to the feast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-51--an-unnamed-feast&#34;&gt;John 5:1 – An unnamed Feast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these things, there was a feast of the Ioudaioi, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John likes this phrase &lt;em&gt;meta touta&lt;/em&gt;, after these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s peculiar that this is an unnamed feast of the Ioudaioi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps omitting the name of the feast is another clue that the location of the miracle is in no way connected with Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we get to John 9 and that healing, the Pool of Siloam WAS connected with the Temple and WAS inside the city walls at the time. It is outside the walls today. The entire complexion of John 9 is vastly different from John 5. It’s a great study to compare the two, which we will do when we get to John 9 in several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is this feast?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were three compulsory feasts, Passover, Shavuot (Pentecost), and Sukkot (Tabernacles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also several minor feasts that were not compulsory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus will attend one of these in John 10, Hanukkah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our working hypothesis is that when John says the feast is “of the Ioudaioi,” we’ll presume it is one of the three major fests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minor feasts were ALWAYS Ioudaioi feasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our proof for this is in John 10; only the Ioudaioi had a feast of dedication, so there is no need to say “feast of the dedication of the Ioudaioi.” And indeed, John does not say this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ioudaioi, as well as the Samaritans and Essenes, had feasts of Passover, Shavuot, and Tabernacles, making the “of the ioudaioi” clarification necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passover doesn’t fit the chronology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the Shavuot or the Tabernacles festival in the same year following the Passover in John 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The feast” usually refers to Sukkot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can almost ask why John bothered to mention the fact that there was a feast since it has no bearing on the events of the chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, one speculation is John is writing to an Israelite, but non Jewish, audience. Therefore “feast of the Ioudaioi” is said to distinguish the festival from nearly identical ones observed by Essenes and Samaritans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll see in John 10, that John merely says, “feast of dedication and it was winter.” This is unmistakably Hanukkah. There is no need to say “Hanukkah of the Ioudaioi” because only the Jews observed Hanukkah. The Essenes and Samaritans did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to Jerusalem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to avoid Samaria, many Jews traveled to Jerusalem via the Jordan Rift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Jericho they traveled up the Ascent of Adummim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we tend to say “up” when we go north and “down” when we go “south”, because of Jerusalem’s elevation and, more importantly, status, we ALWAYS go “UP” to Jerusalem (even if conceivably traveling from a higher elevation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John is much more interested in Jesus’ Judean encounters than His Galilean ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-52-3a&#34;&gt;John 5:2-3a&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in Jerusalem, by the Sheep Gate, there is a pool which in Hebrew is called Bethesda, having five porticoes. In these porticoes lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, limping, or paralyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.875in&#34; alt=&#34;C:\PLBL\03 Jerusalem\Model of Jerusalem\Jerusalem model Pools of Bethesda, tb010200217.jpg&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another description where skeptics were having a field day in denying scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They would say that John possibly wrote his Gospel 25 years after Jerusalem was destroyed; perhaps his aging memory had failed him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can a pool have five porticos?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that Roman pools are four-sided and there can only be at most, four porticos around the pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one had ever heard of a pentagon-shaped poo,l but this is what archeologists were looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one day in the mid-1960s, archaeologists excavated what turned out to be two pools separated by a portico in the middle, with four porticos all around. (photo credit&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). John’s memory wasn’t so bad after all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today this is in the northeastern part of Jerusalem by a well-preserved crusader church called St. Anne’s, named for the mother of Mary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excavation of the pools is continuing to this day – it’s amazing to see the difference in 2023 versus when I was there previously in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is extremely difficult to visualize as the pools were evidently extremely deep. Today the bottom is a good 40’ below the surface level. Over the centuries, Byzantines, Muslims, and Crusaders built structures on top of the pools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-55&#34;&gt;John 5:5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NKJV and KJV includes verses 3b-4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John 5:3-4 (NKJV) &lt;em&gt;In these lay a great multitude of sick people, blind, lame, paralyzed,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and stirred up the water; then whoever stepped in first, after the stirring of the water, was made well of whatever disease he had.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now know this is an error, probably inserted by a well-meaning scribe. It is not included in the most reliable manuscripts. Perhaps the scribe was trying to explain the “stirring of the waters” in verse 7 and was somehow unfamiliar with Asclepius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, including verse 4 leaves us with precisely the wrong impression of what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were not Jewish pools associated with the nearby Temple, and it was not an Angel of the LORD who stirred up the waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 90s, archaeologists found further evidence that the pools were part of an Aesculapian, a pagan healing center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site was a center of a Roman healing cult of the god Asclepius. Many archeologists believe the Asclepius dates to several centuries after Jesus, but it appears to be built upon an earlier Asklepion. More than 400 such healing facilities have been found throughout the Roman empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serpent imagery, hallucinogens, and trickery by the priests were all employed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the priests likely opened a valve between the two pools, which caused a “stirring of the water” attributed to the gods. Lo! It’s a Miracle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asclepios’ mythical daughters are Hygeia and Panacea, which is where we get our healing related words “hygiene” and “panacea”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The symbol of Asclepius is a snake around a pole, likely a corrupted version of Moses lifting up the bronze serpent in the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you’ve ever wondered where modern medicine gets its snake imagery, now you know! &lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.gif&#34; style=&#34;width:2.38986in;height:2.37326in&#34; alt=&#34;Edward Elric&amp;#39;s Flamel | REB Research Blog&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the Devil brings forward Asclepius as the raiser of the dead and the healer of all diseases, may I not say that in this matter likewise he has imitated the prophecies about Christ?” – Justin Martyr. “Dialogue with Trypho”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why bring all this up about Asclepios?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The complexion of the story changes once we realize the man is also paralyzed spiritually - seeking healing from a false god&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These “waters” can’t heal him - only the Pure and Living Water of Jesus, the Mayim Chayim, can (cf. John 2, 3, 4)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to ask, “what was a Jew doing here?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to ask ourselves what we are doing when we look to the world for healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not all western medicine is bad but notice the snake imagery that persists to this day. More and more, medications are changing who we are to the point of altering our DNA/RNA, which should concern us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anytime John mentions a number, we can assume it is significant even though we may not know exactly why it was significant to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here our guess is that John is drawing a connection with this many, who is obviously a Jew but looking for healing in the wrong place, with the Israelite’s 38 years wandering in the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They wandered for a total of 40 years but the punishment for disbelief was 38 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timeframe also underscores the man’s ability to find healing anywhere besides Jesus. This includes the pools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-56-9&#34;&gt;John 5:6-9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, upon seeing this man lying there and knowing that he had already been in that condition for a long time, said to him, “Do you want to get well?” The sick man answered Him, “Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I am coming, another steps down before me.” Jesus *said to him, “Get up, pick up your pallet and walk.” Immediately the man became well, and picked up his pallet and began to walk. Now it was a Sabbath on that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John’s motif of one person not answering another’s question continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John or Jesus has referenced living water in every chapter of John thus far, but Jesus does not mention it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the waters of the pool have nothing to do with the man’s healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He speaks and it is so – just like the first words of God in Genesis 1, “Let there be light.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we will want to contrast this healing with John 9 where Jesus tells the man to wash in the Pool of Siloam. He does NOT command the man to wash here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also want to note this man’s reaction compared with the man in John 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think that Jesus was always causing Sabbath controversy, but there are “only” five recorded healings on Shabbat: Here, John 9, Matthew 12, Luke 13, and Luke 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means there were around 200 Shabbat days in Jesus’ ministry when nothing unusual happened so nothing noteworthy was recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-510-13&#34;&gt;John 5:10-13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the Ioudaioi were saying to the man who was cured, “It is a Sabbath, and it is not permissible for you to carry your pallet.” But he answered them, “He who made me well was the one who said to me, ‘Pick up your pallet and walk.’” They asked him, “Who is the Man who said to you, ‘Pick it up and walk’?” But the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away while there was a crowd in that place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man was healed, but the Ioudaioi are spiritually blind and paralyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This doesn’t necessarily need to be a large group of Ioudaioi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a robust internal debate about what was and was not allowed on Shabbat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Torah itself provides relatively few examples of what constituted “work on the Sabbath.” A famous example is that of the prohibition of gathering wood for a fire (Numbers 15:32).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition, as it tends to do, tries to fill in the gaps with what they think God meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was this tradition that may have included a prohibition on carrying a mat in a public place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is no different than our day with our debates over worship styles, baptism requirements, and communion practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster speculates that these particular Ioudaioi may have been seeking to impose a standard that was not widely accepted, including by Jesus.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be similar to someone whose personal preference is to dress more formally for church but then scolding someone else who doesn’t hold the same dress code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, what could be carried on Shabbat and how far was up for debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t necessarily need to view these rule enforcers as sinister, just like the men of the Nazareth synagogue could have been deeply conflicted and saddened by the fact that they had to uphold the Law of Moses (as they interpreted it) against one of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible will usually tell us when someone approaches Jesus with ill motives; when it doesn’t, we shouldn’t assume bad intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, Jesus in no way was overturning or disrespecting the Sabbath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honoring the Sabbath was one of the big 10 commandments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He could not have violated such a commandment and still claimed to be the Jewish Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ statement in Matthew 24:15-16 acknowledges that He viewed limitations on Shabbat travel as proper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, this is a feast time, so there could have been a million people crowing Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The private nature of this healing leads us to believe this was still early in His ministry (possibly immediately before His proclamation at the Nazareth synagogue, which John doesn’t record).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so, relatively few would have known what He looked like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-514-16&#34;&gt;John 5:14-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, “Behold, you have become well; do not sin anymore, so that nothing worse happens to you.” The man went away, and informed the Ioudaioi that it was Jesus who had made him well. For this reason the Ioudaioi were persecuting Jesus, because He was doing &lt;strong&gt;these things&lt;/strong&gt; on a Sabbath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is big on course corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very fact that you and I are studying together means we’ve allowed Jesus to correct our courses, perhaps multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the themes from our Israel trip was “don’t forget God.” From time to time, Jesus reminds us of when we’ve forgotten God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidently, Jesus didn’t have to tell this man to go to the Temple. He knew what to do; he’d just forgotten God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t exactly sure which specific sin Jesus has in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be the fact that here he was, a Jew seeking healing from a pagan center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, he was guilty of breaking the commandment to have no other gods before the God of Israel. I think we break this commandment today more often than we care to admit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There could have been another specific sin Jesus was referring to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John 9, Jesus makes it clear that there doesn’t have to be a specific sin at the root cause of one’s infirmity, but this doesn’t mean that a specific sin is NEVER the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In view of Jesus’ subsequent discourse, the “sin” could be the resurrection to judgment for bad deeds, referenced in John 5:29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASB says the man “informed” the Ioudaioi about Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems like the translators want us to believe he “informed on” Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the man was not happy with the rebuke even though he was just healed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure the text requires that we read it this way. He could have simply said to the Ioudaioi, “hey I now know who healed me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either approach can map just fine to the text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he’s holding a grudge, this presents a stark contrast with the man in John 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he’s happy he’s healed and restored in his Judaism, he can be viewed as respecting authority along the lines of what Paul describes in Romans 13:1 “Every person is subject to the governing authorities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This outsider, Jesus, was a threat to the Deep State establishment of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lizorkin suggests it’s not “doing these things ON THE SABBATH,” but “DOING THESE THINGS on the Sabbath.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the things Jesus was doing, not when He was doing them that had them riled up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By stepping into the dwelling of a satanic god and establishing the authority of the God of Israel, “the Jerusalem Temple leaders knew that Jesus could not continue performing such powerful miracles without them losing their authority.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-authority-of-the-son-is-the-same-as-the-fathers&#34;&gt;The Authority of the Son is the Same as the Father’s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The healing at the Pools of Bethesda segues into a lengthy discourse about Jesus’ authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John’s overarching objective is to tell us who Jesus IS – specifically, His deity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew-what He said; Mark-what He did; Luke-what He felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than a parenthetical comment by John in verse 18, Jesus speaks uninterrupted between verses 17 and 47.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, a narrative theme of John is to establish Jesus’ authority, specifically in contrast to the illegitimate authority of the Ioudaioi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also see the courtroom motif reappearing. Watch for the terms, “witness,” “testify,” and “believe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-517-18&#34;&gt;John 5:17-18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But He answered them, “My Father is working until now, and I Myself am working.” For this reason, therefore the Ioudaioi were seeking all the more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with His assertion in the synagogue at Nazareth, it is a mistake to say that Jesus never claimed to be God or never claimed to be the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our tour leader Rich says, “He does this a lot – He just does it Jewish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and I might miss the nuanced references but the Jews did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to be sure we don’t miss it, John clarifies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, from the Ioudaioi’s perspective, Jesus was breaking the sabbath. Jesus was not actually breaking the Sabbath just like he was not actually a blasphemer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling Him a sabbath breaker and blasphemer were attempts to discredit what Jesus was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fear of who Jesus was, not what he was saying or doing or when he was doing them, that was the bigger threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Father does not rest from being the Father on Shabbat. His work continues: babies are birthed and circumcised on Shabbat, the temple services continue on Shabbat, and if need be, lives were rescued and emergency medical attention provided on Shabbat. None of these were considered Shabbat violations by the Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These might be considered “valid exceptions” to the general rule that one should do no work on Shabbat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we get to the episode of picking grain on Shabbat, it will be clearer that Jesus’ Shabbat healings are not violations, but valid exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding being equal with God, we can read a verse like Philippians 2:6 (did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped) and get confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest explanation is that in terms of His humanity, Jesus is not equal to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In His deity, they absolutely are equals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another narrative theme in John is that Jesus refuses to submit to the authority the Ioudaioi believe they have. Jesus is going to explain where His authority comes from and He will point to three witnesses who support His claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-519-30-chaism&#34;&gt;John 5:19-30 Chaism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chaism is a literary device where similar thoughts, and usually similar if not identical words, are placed in parallel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure starts by working inward; typically an “A” verse or thought, followed by a “B” verse, then “C”, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in the middle, the structure reverses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If C is the middle verse, then there will be a C’ (pronounced, “C prime”), followed by B’, then concluding with A’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many variations but this is the basic gist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaisms can help us read and study a passage as a single unit. Often in verse-by-verse studies, we zero in on individual verses and sometimes can miss the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at this passage in John in view of this parallel structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A (verse 19): Son does only what Father does (nothing of Himself)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B (20-21): Father and Son give life to the dead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C (22-23): Father gave all judgment to the Son&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D (24): Amen, Amen, they will hear and believe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D’ (25): Amen, Amen, they will hear and live&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C’ (26-27): Father made the Son the source of life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B’ (28-29): all will hear His voice and rise from the dead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A’ (30): Son judges like the father (nothing on His own)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can summarize like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A/A’: Jesus is dependent and reliant on His Father and acts according to His will&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B/B’: The Father and Son have resurrection power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C/C’: The Father has fully commissioned the Son to act in the Father’s stead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D/D’: Eternal life, rests on one’s response to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-519-24&#34;&gt;John 5:19-24&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore Jesus answered and was saying to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, unless it is something He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, these things the Son also does in the same way. For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing; and the Father will show Him greater works than these, so that you will be amazed. For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes. For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son, so that all will honor the Son just as they honor the Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him. Truly, truly, I say to you, the one who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s directly addressing the charge of blasphemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s not usurping that which rightfully belongs to God because “Jesus acts only on the Father’s authority and in conjunction with His will.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s claiming to be deity all throughout this passage. “He just does it Jewish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-525-30&#34;&gt;John 5:25-30&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Truly, truly, I say to you, a time is coming and even now has arrived, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He gave to the Son also to have life in Himself; and He gave Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man. Do not be amazed at this; for a time is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear His voice, and will come out: those who did the good deeds to a resurrection of life, those who committed the bad deeds to a resurrection of judgment. I can do nothing on My own. As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is righteous, because I do not seek My own will but the will of Him who sent Me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Son of Man is a messianic title used by Daniel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judgment is in His job description; just not with regard to His first coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sent one is an Apostle, or in Hebrew, a Shaliach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Moses and the prophets were sometimes viewed as God’s agents.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust&#34;&gt;Walking in His dust&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Ambassador. An agent. When people look at the shaliach, they are supposed to see the one who sent the &lt;em&gt;shaliach&lt;/em&gt;, just as the &lt;em&gt;shaliach’s&lt;/em&gt; behavior is supposed to reflect the behavior of the one who sent him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and I are &lt;em&gt;schlicim&lt;/em&gt; for our Messiah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-531-35-johns-courtroom-narrative&#34;&gt;John 5:31-35. John’s Courtroom Narrative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If I alone &lt;strong&gt;testify&lt;/strong&gt; about Myself, My &lt;strong&gt;testimony&lt;/strong&gt; is not true. There is another who &lt;strong&gt;testifies&lt;/strong&gt; about Me, and I know that the testimony which He gives about Me is true. You have sent messengers to John, and he has &lt;strong&gt;testified&lt;/strong&gt; to the truth. But the &lt;strong&gt;testimony&lt;/strong&gt; I receive is not from man, but I say these things so that you may be saved. He was the lamp that was burning and shining, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is speaking of John the Baptist and John 1:19 when the Ioudaioi sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They tolerated John as long as he played in their sandbox; the “brood of vipers” comment probably didn’t go over well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John the Baptizer’s call to repentance served to remind everyone that they, too, had forgot God. Despite being the chosen people, they are not immune from wandering away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man at Bethesda was an example of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus told that man to repent, just as John told his audience to repent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chosen captured the opposing sentiment well in the Nazareth synagogue scene. Many in Jesus’ day felt that they were on the team by virtue of their lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, all need to hear His Voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sometimes focus on our individual relationship with Jesus and disregard the community component of belief. They did the opposite. Both are errors. We forget we are all part of one symbiotic body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first-century oil lamp typically fit in the palm of one’s hand and did not put off that much light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typologically, John’s lamp was only a tiny representation of the true Light that had come into the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the Ioudaioi were hearing Jesus’ words but if they had a rebuttal John did not record it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-536&#34;&gt;John 5:36&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But the testimony I have is greater than the testimony of John; for the works which the Father has given Me to accomplish—the very works that I do—testify about Me, that the Father has sent Me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Father has commissioned Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is claiming to be the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is claiming to be God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This public proclamation probably happened around the same time as the proclamation in Nazareth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is now “going public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The healing of the man earlier in the chapter is evidence that Jesus has God’s approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The miracles are so commonplace to us, but we need to remember a healing like this is similar to when Jesus calmed the storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is exerting unnatural power over something no earthly being has any control over: a body that fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the storm was calmed, the disciples asked, “who then is this?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be our question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the question John the Gospel writer is answering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-537-40&#34;&gt;John 5:37-40&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And the Father who sent Me, He has testified about Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His form. Also you do not have His word remaining in you, because you do not believe Him whom He sent. “You examine the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is those very Scriptures that testify about Me; and yet you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life here is specifically life in the age to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the introduction we talked about a third witness. We have had John the Baptist, The Father, and now we have the Torah of Moses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s sad that so many Christians discount the value of the Old Testament. None other than Jesus says those 39 books are all about Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus might be implying that if they were there when the Torah was given, they would not have believed, exemplifying John 1:14-18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To reject Jesus is to reject the Scriptures.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I had been thinking about what might be our parallel. The Jewish leadership put the rules around Shabbat above the one who created Shabbat. Surely, we must have a parallel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For Evangelicals, I think our closest parallel might actually be the Bible, which I know sounds like heresy, but hear me out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ll use the example of a recent president who walked to a church in Washington and held up a Bible as a photo op. He didn’t read from the Bible, but he held it up like it was the binding and the paper that made it sacred.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I happen to like this President very much so I’m not making a political statement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not the printing or the paper, but it’s the One Whom the text speaks of and points us to that is Sacred.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I love the fact that we say we’re Bible believing Christians, but we probably should say that we are Christ-followers, or Jesus’ disciples.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Believing in the Bible won’t give us eternal life, and that is Jesus point here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Believing in the One Who wrote the Bible will. There’s a difference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Word of God is Jesus, which includes but is not limited to the Bible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I had been a little unsure of this but then I was watching the pastoral commentary on an episode of the chosen where the Evangelical representative said the exact same thing, so I feel like I’m on solid ground here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-541-43&#34;&gt;John 5:41-43&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do not receive glory from people; but I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves. “I have come in My Father’s name, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have come in My Father’s name&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To reject the agent is to reject the sender.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One comes in his own name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Give us Barabbas!” is one example of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Anti-Christ is also not a bad speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an Essene tradition of a “Wicked Priest,” which may be an individual person or a corrupt system claiming to speak and act on behalf of God. The Ioudaioi’s system might fit this description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately we can’t state with exact certainty whom Jesus refers to by the “one in his own name.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ioudaioi, not all Jews but only the corrupt establishment, DO seek power and to be admired by the people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are blind that they do not have the love of God. They think they are “on the team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-544-47&#34;&gt;John 5:44-47&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How can you believe when you accept glory from one another and you do not seek the glory that is from the one and only God? Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; the one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have put your hope. “For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote about Me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a big dig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus says, “You can’t be trusted to make a sound decision about Me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are like politicians or judges who only do what will earn glowing headlines (or worse, bribed to act a certain way) instead of doing what is faithful and just.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, they have a conflict of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if Jesus were inclined to seek their approval (which He isn’t), it would be impossible because of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These words support John 3:17-18&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John 3:17-18 “For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him. [18] “The one who believes in Him is not judged; the one who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There already was a “chief prosecutor of Israel appointed by God Himself. His name was Moses.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses wrote of Jesus in the promise of the woman’s seed (Gen 3:15), the rightful ruler (Gen 49:10), the star from Jacob (Num 24:17), and the prophet to come (Deut 18:18). The Passover lambs foreshadowed the true Passover Lamb who would die so that the nation could be delivered (John 1:29; 1 Cor 5:7; Rev 5:6).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
