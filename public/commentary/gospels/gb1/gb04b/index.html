<p><strong>Read/hear the portions</strong>: Luke 2:1-38</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In NATIVITY part II, Joseph and Mary must travel to Bethlehem to take part in a census. Five miles from Jerusalem, Bethlehem serves as the birthplace of David and King Messiah. Close by at Migdal Eder, a group of shepherds is startled by an angel who announces the birth of the Messiah. The new family makes their first trip to the Temple in Jerusalem, where they encounter a holy man and a prophetess.</p>

<h2 id="geographic-setting">Geographic Setting:</h2>
<p>Luke 2 is our first encounter where geography plays a significant supporting role in our understanding of the Gospels. In just about every remaining chapter in the Gospels, we will want to pause to understand the geographic background.</p>
<img src="images/media/image1.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.875in" />
<p>This satellite photo shows two possible travel routes from Nazareth to Bethlehem<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The more direct route would take them through Samaria along the Way of the Patriarchs. In other words, this is the same road that Abraham and Jacob traveled frequently. It’s about 70 miles to Jerusalem going this way. While we’re often taught that Jews and Samaritans avoided each other at all costs, it was not unheard of for Jews to use this road. Luke doesn’t tell us which way they traveled, but we know Jesus traveled the shorter route on at least one occasion in John 4.</p>
<p>The way around would take travelers from Galilee, through the Jezreel valley, around Mt. Gilboa, where they would follow the Jordan down to Jericho. At Jericho, they would hang a right to make the grueling climb along the Ascent of Adummim up to Jerusalem. The photo below shows the climb from 800-1200 feet below sea level at Jericho (depending on where you measure) to 2500 feet above at Jerusalem.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Going in this direction added an extra 20 miles to the journey and required fording the Jordan a couple of times. We know for sure Jesus traveled this way as He made His way up to Jerusalem for the final time of His earthly ministry after he met with Zacchaeus and Bartimaeus in Jericho.</p>
<img src="images/media/image2.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.875in" />
<p>There are several examples Luke paints a very different picture of “the Christmas story” than many of us have grown up with. We call these &ldquo;Christmyth Busters.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <div>
    <p><strong>Christmyth: A December birth for Jesus is unlikely.</strong></p>
<p>One large problem with assuming a December birth is that the dirt roads would have been nearly impassable in early winter because of the snow, rain, and mud. If we assume they took the long route along the Jordan – ~90 miles, the Jordan river would have been swollen and the banks flooded. In short, it is unlikely that a roman administrator in his right mind would have conducted a census at this time of year (think of the alps in Italy and the mountains in Turkey). To be fair, not all Roman emperors were in their right minds although that charge has never been leveled against Augustus.</p>
<p>As we mentioned in <strong>Annunciations</strong>, there is strong tradition to suggest John the Baptist was born in the spring, which means Jesus would have been borm six months later in the early fall.</p>

<p>While Matthew gives us only a brief overview regarding Jesus&rsquo; actual birth – remember his only mention was in Matthew 1:24; everything after that verse is AFTER his birth – Luke will give us a lot more detail. We said in Luke 1 that Luke’s intent is to give us an orderly account. Luke is focused on who Jesus was, so we’re going to get a lot of detail about the human side of Jesus.</p>
<p>Scholars and skeptics have a problem with Luke’s dating of the Quirinius census to AD 6, which would have been way too late to have occurred at the time of Jesus’ birth. King Herod died in 4 BC, so Jesus’ birth had to be before Herod’s death. The problem is we have no historical evidence of a census that occurred during the later stages of Herod’s life. We must remember that “absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.” This is the fallacy the skeptics are engaging in with their argument. They’re assuming Luke made an error, for which we similarly have no evidence.</p>
<p>From the Bible itself, Acts 5:37 tells us that Luke knew exactly when the AD6 census was because he references it directly. Again this is one of those instances where the Narrative would have been just fine with “Judas the Galilean rose up and drew away some of the people” but the Holy Spirit adds “in the days of the census.” This, in my opinion, is the Holy Spirit anticipating the Quirinius question and letting us know that Luke was referencing a different census in Luke 2.</p>
<p>While we don’t have any extrabiblical evidence to support a worldwide census around 5 BC, we do have some reasonable clues to suggest Luke is accurate. Of course, I and I presume most watching this video will start with our presupposition that the Bible is inerrant in its original manuscripts. We have no reason to doubt Luke, therefore we contend he’s telling the truth. To be fair, not every person (not even each who professes to be a Christian) has our presupposition; so, it doesn’t hurt to dig deeper to be educated on plausible explanations in case we are asked.</p>
<p>Luke mentions Caesar Augustus. Caesar Augustus (63 BC-AD 14) was the first Roman emperor. He reigned as emperor from 27 BC to AD 14.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> One theme of Luke is that in many places, he appears to be “pro-roman.” Centurions are often the “good guys” in Luke’s narrative. In Acts, Luke is careful to say it’s not the Romans causing trouble, but the religious establishment. This gives support to the speculation that Luke wrote Luke and Acts as affidavits for Paul’s trial at Rome.</p>
<p>As an executive, Augustus was among the greatest of all the emperors. Although there are no records of him ever ordering a worldwide census, it is not unlikely that he did. We presume this census must have served a needed function in the administration of the Roman Empire. In God’s providence, it was used to bring Joseph and Mary from Nazareth to Bethlehem in order to fulfill the prophecy of the Messiah’s birth in Micah 5:2.</p>
<img src="images/media/image4.jpeg" style="width:3.95694in;float:right" />
<p>In this case, archaeology may help us resolve the conundrum. This tombstone doesn’t mention Quirinius by name but it mentions someone who was TWICE legate of Syria and Phoenicia during the time of Augustus.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> This presents a couple of reasonable explanations. 1. Quirinus conducted at least two censuses: one in AD 6 for which we have extrabiblical confirmation, and one at the time of Jesus for which we do not. 2. Formen suggests Quirinius may have <em>completed</em> a census in AD 6 that was started much earlier.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> 3. The Greek word “proto” can mean first, but it can also mean before. A prototype is an early model before the final version. This could be the census BEFORE Quirinius. Critics and skeptics like to point to apparent discrepancies in an attempt to cast doubt on the text, but usually all it takes is a little digging to develop alternate plausible theories.</p>
<p>One aspect that would be good for us to be more comfortable with is certain tensions in the biblical text. They are nothing to be afraid of. When the Jewish sages encountered such matters in the Hebrew Bible, they often write “this is a difficulty,” then go on to postulate on what may be going on. Often there is not agreement between sages on how to interpret.</p>
<p>Patrick Lencioni wrote a business book called the “five dysfunctions of a team.” A fear of conflict and artificial harmony is one of those disfunctions. Lencioni says that open, candid dialogue and constructive conflict is how teams grow; and I would add it’s how disciples grow too. We don’t fully grow by being spoon-fed a bunch of facts. We grow by challenging and being challenged by the text so that we resolve all conflicts as best we can, and in so doing we thoroughly own and understand the text and make it our own. Discipleship is not always comfortable (ask Peter); following Jesus is not a spectator sport.</p>

<p>In the “Genealogies” lesson, we discussed the theory that Matthew presents Jesus’ line through Joseph and Luke presents His line through Mary. This enables Jesus also to be of the “house” and “Lineage” of David but without the curse on the bloodline documented in Jeconiah 22.</p>

    <p><strong>Christmyth: our conceptions about “no room at the inn” are all wrong.</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/media/image8.jpg" style="width:50%;float:right" />We often imagine Mary being rejected by a grumpy innkeeper at the exact moment of an impending medical emergency and all they could find was some stinky animal feeding trough.</p>
<p>Although Luke is clear that Jesus’ birth was unusual, this isn’t quite what happened.</p>
<p>“No room at the Inn” is an extremely poor translation. There was no room at the <em>katalyma</em>, which is a guest room that is part of a private dwelling. Luke uses a different word for a commercial innkeeper – <em>pandocheion</em> in Luke 10:34 and the Good Samaritan story.</p>
<p>There is a more logical explanation: a <em>katalyma</em> is simply not an appropriate place for a birth. Guest rooms were likely full because of the census so they were likely sharing sleeping space. A birth is an intimate moment for the family and quite likely Mary made some screams (I don’t think they had epidurals back then), both of which make it uncomfortable and awkward to have others around.</p>
<p>There is no question, however, that Jesus’ entry into the world was humble and lowly.</p>
<p>What they often did do was build their houses so that the basement (if I could use that term) was a cave. They would build the upper levels of the house on top. The custom in that day is that’s where they would keep the livestock. That sounds foreign to us, but that’s what they did. That’s what the picture above is showing (although we’re pretty sure Mary did not have the incandescent light bulb to light her way).</p>

<h3 id="the-cave-tradition">The Cave tradition</h3>
<p>Early church tradition places Jesus birth in a cave. One fact about history is the next occupying force was tended not to respect previous folk’s holy places. The fact that the people were able to be conquered was taken as a sign that their gods were weak. In approximately 135, the wicked Emperor Hadrian (yes the same guy with the wall in England) thought he would stamp out Judaism and this weird offshoot that came to be called Christianity by converting all of their holy places to pagan roman shrines. He did this with the Temple and the church of Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem and he did this with a certain Cave in Bethlehem. In other words, he wouldn’t have tried to erase these locations if they weren’t significant; it shows these sites were revered long before Hadrian came along. So far from erasing this history, he actually marked and preserved these locations for posterity. Thank you Hadrian!</p>

<p>From here and verse 15 we know that the shepherds were some distance away from Bethlehem<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. In other words they could not have been there at the moment of Jesus’ birth.</p>
<p>Another strike against a December birth is that it probably would have been far too cold to keep flocks out by night. In fact, it suggests the opposite. When it was warmer, the sheep would pasture by night; when it was cooler, they pasture during the day.</p>
<p>Stern notes, “shepherding was and is a despised occupation in the Middle East,” and stands in stark contrast with the Magi of Matthew 2, who were at the opposite end of the social scale. “Both came to honor the messiah (because he is the) Messiah of high and low alike.”<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>This is already the third “fear not” in Luke (to Zechariah, Mary, and now the Shepherds).</p>
<img src="images/media/image11.jpg" style="width:4.89068in;height:3.5in" />
<p>“City of David” is a term that is used interchanably for Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Both cities claim King David the way both Abilene, Kansas and Dennison Texas claim Eisenhower.</p>
<p>Remember Yeshua is connected for the words for salvation and savior. In Luke 1:47 Mary’s “spirit rejoices in God (her) Savior.” Here it is clear that the Savior is the Messiah, Yeshua and therefore Messiah = God of Israel. This is one of the dots that Luke is connecting for us gentiles. Think of this the next time you ask whether someone is “saved”? You are REALLY asking “Are you Jesus’d?” Do you have joy in being Jesus’d? Do people look at you and say “he or she is Jesus’d!”</p>
<p>“Christ” is not His last name. It is His title in Greek. His title in Hebrew is “Messiah” – Jesus the Messiah and Jesus Christ both mean the same thing. Since He ministered to a Jewish culture, we encourage saying Jesus the Messiah. If you’re slightly more daring, you can even call him Yeshua HaMashiach! On a related note some people have websites telling others that Jesus is a pagan name related to Zeus. This is internet folklore. Yeshua to Ieasus to Jesus is a logical progression from Hebrew/Aramaic to Greek/Latin to English.</p>

<p>Jesus’ parents fulfill the Jewish Law properly. Jesus had to perfectly keep the law in order to be the Messiah. Even when He is physically unable to do so by His own means, his parents do what is required.</p>
<p>There are two different rituals going on here at the same time: the offering of the firstborn and the required ritual purification of a mother after she gives birth.</p>
<p>The offering for the firstborn was done after the 30<sup>th</sup> day (traditionally the 31<sup>st</sup> day), while the purification was done after 40 days. They either did both at the same time or stayed in Jerusalem between the 31<sup>st</sup> and 41<sup>st</sup> days. If Luke is being fully precise in his chronology, it appears that both offerings may have been on the same day.</p>
<p>Although the text mentions both, it’s curious that the recorded offering in verses 22-24 deals ONLY with the purification procedure, not the firstborn redemption.</p>
<h3 id="purification-of-mary">Purification of Mary</h3>
<p>While giving birth is not a sin, according to the Torah, it rendered a woman in an unclean state. Being unclean is a temporary status and is not the same as sinning. Many times, an unclean status was not avoidable. Mary and Joseph followed the required offering to purify Mary from her unclean status. Offering two pigeons or two turledoves the provision for those who couldn’t afford a lamb, according to Leviticus 12:1-8. This indicates they were poor.</p>
<h3 id="redemption-of-the-firstborn-son">Redemption of the Firstborn Son</h3>
<p>The redemption of the firstborn is directly tied to the Levitical priesthood. The father typically handed the baby boy to a priest, and say, “This is my firstborn son, and the Holy One, blessed be He, has commanded me to redeem him.” The priest then says, “Which do you prefer, to give away your firstborn son to me, or to redeem him for five shekels as you are required by the Torah?” The father then typically replies, “I wish to redeem my son; I present you with the cost of his redemption.” The father pays, then the priest takes the child in his arms, blesses him, then hands the child back to the father.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reasonable to conclude Joseph paid the five shekels (or some equivalent provision for the poor), but Luke doesn’t mention this. Another way to look at it is that the Holy Spirit edited that out. During the Genealogies lessons, we learned we want to ask “why” whenever the Holy Spirit includes a seemingly unnecessary detail. Here we need to ask the same question when the Holy Spirit omits a seemingly critical detail. When we dig a little we are rewarded with insight.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <details class="spoiler "  id="spoiler-0">
  <summary>More &lsquo;Holy Spirit editing&rsquo; in Genesis 22</summary>
  <p><p>The classic example of an obvious &ldquo;omission&rdquo; that results in a deeper spiritual point is Genesis 22:19 <em>So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham lived at Beersheba</em>. This is immediately after the Angel stopped Abraham from sacrificing Isaac. After the promise given to Abraham in verses 16-18, it’s reasonable to conclude that BOTH Abraham AND ISAAC, descended the mountain and return to Abraham’s young men who were watching the donkeys in 22:5. But Isaac is not mentioned here. He is not mentioned again until after being united with Rebekah in Gen 24:62. If we think in types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abraham is a type of the Father who sacrificed His Son.</li>
<li>Isaac is a type of Jesus who “disappears” after being “sacrificed.” He remains “hidden” until he is united with His bride. It gets better.</li>
<li>Rebekah is that gentile bride who agrees to be wed to a groom she has never seen.  She is a type of the Church.</li>
<li>All of this is orchestrated by a servant whose name means God’s Helper. The servant is a type of the Holy Spirit.</li>
</ul>
<p>So we have the Father, Son, Spirit, and gentile church all in view in Genesis 22 and 24. The typology doesn’t work unless Isaac is somehow edited out of the record.</p>
</p>
</details>
  </div>
</div>
<p>In Luke’s case, if we look ahead to the end of the story, there are any number of reasonable applications as to why the five shekels “wasn’t paid.”</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Jesus lived His life in service of God, just as if He had been handed to the temple priest for lifetime service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus WILL pay the price to be the “Firstborn of All creation.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus is the one who will redeem us; He is not the One who needs to be redeemed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus is a priest in the order of Melchizedek, not Levi. Heb 7:11 Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, rather than one named after the order of Aaron?</p>

<p>The blessing in verse 34 is likely the <em>v’arevecha</em>, the priestly benediction, from Numbers 6. We’re speculating but as this is directed to Mary, potentially, Simeon handed Jesus to Mary instead of Joseph as he spoke these words. This would have been unusual (the baby was supposed to be handed back to the father according to tradition) but this could be a hint that Simeon knew that Joseph was not the father in the usual sense and/or b) giving Jesus to Mary would have underscored the severity of Simeon’s words.</p>
<p>After six oracles promising joy and salvation, this seventh turns dark and unsettling.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> It is the first indication of pain in the Gospel story.

<p>We aren’t sure why, but Luke doesn’t record what she said. First, it’s interesting that Luke notes she is from the tribe of Asher. Asher was one of the ten northern tribes that was taken into captivity by the Assyrians in 721 BC. This has led to the so-called “ten lost tribes” myth. Apparently Anna was not lost. When we get to Revelation and the sealing of the 144,000, some wonder how we can take the “12,000” from each of the 12 tribes literally if ten of the tribes are supposedly lost. Luke is telling us that God knows exactly where His people are. If you’re feeling distant from God, God is not the one who moved.</p>
<p>Anna or channa in Hebrew, means “grace” or “favor,” so whatever she said likely provided some comfort after Simeon’s dark predictions. She was married for seven years, then became a widow. Rather than remarry, she elected to devote her remaining years to the service of the Lord. Her devotion foreshadows the earlier Jewish believers who will meet in the Temple every day to proclaim Jesus after His Ascension.</p>
<p>Note that Simeon, Anna and the Jewish apostles in Acts 1:6 who were expecting Jesus to redeem Israel and Jerusalem weren’t wrong. When we get to Acts 1, we are often taught by well-intended teachers something along the lines of, “those dense apostles. Even after all Jesus taught, they STILL didn’t understand how wrong they were. Once again, Jesus has to set them straight.” As we will be fond of pointing out, Acts 1:7 and 1:8 does not support any type of correction or rebuke. In fact, Jesus doesn’t even disagree with the assumptions behind their question. He merely says, “It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.” (Acts 1:7-8). The Redemption Simeon and Anna were waiting for will happen, but it will be on God’s timeline.</p>
<p>Next, in Luke’s narrative, the Holy Family returns to Nazareth. Matthew records that they had some other adventures first. We’ll look at those in the next lesson called “the Nazarene.”</p>
