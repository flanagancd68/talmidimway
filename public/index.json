This verse is paramount for two reasons:\nI, and every other commentator is human. I will of course make every attempt to be faithful and reliable, but we all have our biases, blind spots and faulty conclusions. For this I apologize in advance! The Biblical model is to “trust but verify” - it is up to you, the reader, to do your diligence and make sure facts and conclusions any commentator asserts are scriptural. Key terms Anachronism /Anachronistic Fallacy Misappropriation of concepts and ideas in time\nFor example it is often assumed that Jesus, Paul and other gospel writers preached a new gentile religion.\nHistorically, the Jewish-Gentile split among followers of Jesus did not occur until the very late 1st century at the earliest, and more probably occurred gradually between the 2nd and 4th centuries. Until this time, what we know as “Christianity” was a sect within Judiasm.\nTherefore, since the split had not occurred at the time Jesus was speaking or Paul was writing, there is no way could have have had a new Gentile religion in view.\nPresuppositions Our set of beliefs we bring with us as we read the text\nEisegesis Inserting concepts INTO the Text\nGenerally, we want to avoid, or at list limit, eisegesis. Since we are humans, with thoughts, emotions, presuppositions, and biases, it is nearly impossible to completely eliminate eisegesis as we read the biblical texts.\nThe best course of action is to realize and accept when we are inserting things into the text that are not written and perform Acts 17:11 due diligence on the applicable concept/conclusion.\nExegesis Extracting concepts FROM the Text\nExegesis is what we strive for. As with eisegesis, we must perform Acts 17:11 due diligence and make sure these concepts are consistent with the remainder of Scripture.\nReferences used At the conclusion of each lesson a list of works cited will be published. I encourage anyone to never take my word for it but validate what I say. In fact, Chuck Missler used to paraphrase Acts 17:11 as, “don’t believe a word I tell you.

This is a presupposition.\nWhen we read the Old Testament, we often subconsciously apply this filter. As we read the text, we may find ourselves saying something along the lines of “that was for the Jews only, it’s not for us today because Jesus did away with the Law.” This is eisegesis.\nThe problem is that, historically, the Jewish-Gentile split among followers of Jesus did not occur until the very late 1st century at the earliest and more probably occurred gradually between the 2nd and 4th centuries. Paul continued to keep Torah well after his Damascus Road experience. Therefore, our presupposition is faulty because it is an anachronistic fallacy. The concepts we inserted into the text are flawed.\nTo be sure, many parts of the law are only for Jews and not gentile believers in Jesus, but possibly not as much as we might think. The historical truth is this:\nThe Torah is a Jewish document that was taken VERY SERIOUSLY by the early church, which was a sect of Jews that operated wholly under the umbrella of Judaism of their time. To best understand what Moses was communicating, we need to view the words through this lens and let the text speak to us (Exegesis).\nWe ALL have presuppositions, and some amount of eisegesis is unavoidable. After all, we are humans with thoughts, emotions, and biases, it is nearly impossible to completely eliminate eisegesis as we read the biblical texts.\nFor example, I’m assuming most of us are approaching the early chapters of Genesis as followers of Jesus from a conservative, evangelical, or fundamentalist branch of the faith who place a high degree of confidence in the accuracy of the accounts given, particularly in Genesis 1-11. Evangelicals are bringing this presupposition with them and therefore, are going to have less issue with a seven-day creation as the Bible describes it than Someone from a more liberal Christian tradition, who is more likely to view these chapters allegorically.

Fish, birds and reptiles are created on the fifth day; land animals, and then the human being, on the sixth.

John 1:1-4, 10 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made…. He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. Last time, we looked at these seven profound words, the connection to John 1:1, and the fact that the world was made through Jesus, the א and the ת.\nThe pattern of sevens is just getting started in this chapter!\nGenesis 1:2 References The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. Isa 45:18 For thus says the LORD, who created the heavens (he is God!), who formed the earth and made it (he established it; he did not create it empty, he formed it to be inhabited!): “I am the LORD, and there is no other.\nJob 26:7 He stretches out the north over the void and hangs the earth on nothing.\nJeremiah 4:23 I looked on the earth, and behold, it was without form and void; and to the heavens, and they had no light.\nוְהָאָ֗רֶץ הָיְתָ֥ה תֹ֙הוּ֙ וָבֹ֔הוּ וְחֹ֖שֶׁךְ עַל־פְּנֵ֣י תְהֹ֑ום\nVeha’ARetz haytah TOhu vaVOhu, vCHOshech al p’nei t’home.\nWalton notes the passage expresses the sense of “that which has not yet been differentiated and assigned function. No boundaries or definitions have been established.”2\nThe “Gap Theory”?\nתֹּהוּ (tohu) is the word used in verse 2 for “waste, desolation, empty”. The same word is used in Isaiah 45:18, who says that God did NOT create the earth tohu.\nThere appears to be a contradiction.\nFrom this the so-called “gap theory” has emerged – they see some type of gap between verses 1 and 2, where some type of judgment occurred.\nTo try to support this, a minority of scholars would say the verse could be translated, “BUT the earth HAD BECOME formless and void.”\nIn other words, God created the earth to be perfect, but there was some kind of judgment causing it to become formless, void, and dark.\nThis judgment then led to the recreation of the surface of the earth in six days.\nKeil \u0026amp; Delitzsch reject this concept. “Tohu alone is frequently employed as synonymous with non-existence (not becoming non-existent).”3\nIt’s important to remember there is no life or death on earth until the Fall in chapter 3.\nSo, people who try to put dinosaurs into this “gap” to conform with modern hypotheses about what killed the dinosaurs or reconcile with evolutionary theory are misguided.\nPotentially it is when Satan fell, but even this theory has problems.\nOccam’s Razor tells us that the most straightforward explanation is usually the correct one.\nThe most straightforward explanation to reconcile Genesis 1:2 and Isaiah 45:18, is when God initially created the earth, He didn’t create it to be permanently formless and void (Isaiah).\nIt was momentarily formless, void, and dark (possibly only for a fraction of an instant) until the Ruach Elohim went into action.\nI encourage readers to hold very loosely to any man-made theory about what is going on in Genesis 1-6. We just don’t have a very good concept of what life was like before the Flood and even less insight about what life was like before the Fall.\nThe Answers in Genesis site has an informative article on this topic: The Gap Theory – an Idea with Holes.\nNote that God specifically created the darkness - Isa 45:7 I form light and create darkness; I make well-being and create calamity; I am the LORD, who does all these things.\nThe “deep” is a term surrounded in mystery.\nSymbolically, the “deep” and “waters” suggest chaos (and were viewed as such by the ancients) Genesis 1:2 References And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. 1 Jn 4:2 By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God.\nLuk 4:17, 21 …","date":1662595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666313328,"objectID":"5ba5b7991ce95bec2c634f20175adff8","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/genesis/gen1/gen01/","publishdate":"2022-09-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/genesis/gen1/gen01/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":["Creation","Image","Marriage"],"title":"Genesis 1 Creation","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Revelation Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents “Revelation” (not “Revelations”) What is “Apocalyptic Literature”?

Summary\nWelcome to our series on the book of Revelation we call “Revelation Backgrounds.” In this introductory episode, we will provide an introduction to the book, some background into Jewish Apocalyptic literature, and we’ll provide what we see are Seven Keys to Interpretation. Revelation can be a complex book, but these keys will help assure we get started on the right path.\nVideo\n“Revelation” (not “Revelations”) In his course on Jerusalem, Dr. Cargill said, “the name of the book is ‘RevelationnnnnnNUH,’” he said to emphasize the singular1. He continued, “This is a pet peeve of mine. If you call it ‘RevelationS,’ it means you have never read the 1st verse, and I will flunk you.” Of course, we won’t flunk anybody, but this is a good reminder that the correct name of the book is not “Revelations,” but “Revelation.” What is “Apocalyptic Literature”? We often think of an apocalypse as some cataclysmic event involving worldwide destruction. From the Greek word apokalupsis, apocalypse means “revealing” or “unveiling.” Specifically, we would say an unveiling of something not previously known, which wouldn’t be known were it not for divine intervention In the days of John, there was a significant body of Jewish apocalyptic literature that he and much of his audience would have known2. The general flow of apocalyptic literature: A person in a “spiritual state,” such as fasting and praying, is caught up to a realm usually unseen by mortals (possibly physically or possibly by way of a vision). He is given a tour, usually guided by an angel, where he sees heavenly worship services, God’s throne, and various hallowed chambers. He also sometimes sees “the war behind the war.” In other words, when there is a physical war on earth, the person gets to witness a corresponding unseen spiritual warfare. Then he gets to witness a final climactic battle between the forces of good and evil and resulting judgments. Often, the things the person with the vision sees are nearly impossible to put into words The best he can do is use the best words he can, Because the human is trying to explain the inexplicable, we end up with the extreme symbolism, such as beasts doing strange things (Daniel 7:5-6) and objects that seem to defy the laws of physics (Ezekiel 1:16-20) The general purpose of an Apocalypse is for God to reassure His people to remain faithful. Lancaster summarizes a biblical apocalypse like this: “Although things on earth seem terribly unjust, with the righteous suffering and the wicked prospering, a day is coming where God will pour out his wrath upon the wicked and reward the righteous.” 3 In other words, “your faith and suffering are not in vain.” The Apocalypse of Paul?

To understand his words, we need to understand them from a first-century Galilean Jewish perspective. Jesus brings the revelation and glory of God into the world of men.\nRead/hear the portion: John 1:1-18\nTable of Contents Introduction John 1:1 John 1:2-6 John 1:7 John 1:8-13 John 1:14-15 John 1:16:18 Study Questions References Video\nIntroduction The Gospels are Jewish documents. 1st Century “Christianity” was a Jewish sect. John is often viewed as contrasting the correct way of Christianity with the incorrect way of Judaism, but this represents what is called an anachronistic fallacy, often shortened to “Anachronism” - misappropriation of concepts and ideas in time.\nWe sometimes see inadvertent anachronisms in period-piece movies. An actor playing a cowboy might be wearing a digital watch in a movie set in the 18th century. In the movie “Back to the Future,” at the 1955 enchantment under the sea dance, Marty McFly is playing a 1958 Gibson guitar. Of course, something made in 1958 would not have existed in 1955. That’s an anachronism.\nIt is a challenge to restrain our own presuppositions, our set of established beliefs, when we read the Bible. It is natural to assume a biblical speaker to affirm our presuppositions in order to justify our positions.\nAn overarching anachronistic fallacy many commentators commit is to take what is called “the parting of the ways” between Judaism and Christianity that occurred much later (2nd-4th centuries CE) and reading it back into this text in the 1st century.\nIn other words, since it had not occurred yet, there is absolutely no way John or any other biblical writer could have the split between Judaism and Christianity in view when they were writing. Even to say something like “the 12 Apostles were Christians” is an anachronism. Since the term “Christian” hadn’t been coined yet, they would have viewed themselves as Jewish followers of their Jewish Messiah.\nThe next term is “Presuppositions,” which refers to those things we have accepted as true without needing external verification. It can a challenge to restrain our own presuppositions, our set of established beliefs, when we read the Bible. If we are taught something over and over, we naturally accept that thing as true and don’t challenge it. Most of the time this poses no issue, but problems can arise when what we accept as true, may not be true, or at least not true in every specific application. For example, when we read the Bible, we often subconsciously assume a biblical speaker affirms all of our presuppositions. For example, if I have been taught that Jesus had combative exchanges with ALL religious leaders, then when I read the Bible, I’m going to read all exchanges between Jesus and the religious leaders as combative. I will draw this conclusion even when a plain, surface reading of the text doesn’t necessarily support such a conclusion.\nWhen I superimpose my presuppositions into the biblical text, we call that “eisegesis.” Modern conservative scholars would all agree that eisegesis is bad yet many of us do it almost automatically.\nWhat we strive for is EXEGESIS, understanding the text IN CONTEXT to extract what the author was saying. To do this, we must first realize the gospels are Jewish documents written within a historical context of 2nd Temple Judaism. The audience were Jewish Christ followers together with many non-Jews who had joined a Jewish sect.\nThe early church fathers affirmed John’s authorship of this Gospel strongly and unanimously. Some of the fathers claim to have personally known those who knew John in Ephesus in his later years, thus making a direct link to the tradition of Johannine authorship. The evangelist John is shown here with the symbol of an eagle, the one of the four living creatures which is traditionally associated with him (Ezekiel 1:5-10 and Revelation 4:6-7).\nJohn 1:1 John 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. Logos in the normal sense means “word or speech”. In this prologue, John uses it in the mystical sense. He alludes directly to the beginning of the Torah and the beginning of creation. He starts this with an intentional allusion to Genesis 1:1 “In the beginning”\nJohn 1:2-6 John 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. 6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. Recall the first act of Creation. “and God said Let there be Light, and there was light.”\nIn verse 4 John declares that this life had always been available through God’s word, which is the same word that he identifies with Jesus (IVP).\nIn John 1:5, The divine light from the first day of creation shines once again into the dark world of man, …","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666803615,"objectID":"d64023209dce473d060a08cbf427e14a","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb1/gb01/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb1/gb01/","section":"commentary","summary":"John 1:1-18","tags":["Gospels","John 1"],"title":"The Logos - John 1:1-18","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"1-min Devo ","date":1673740800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674928816,"objectID":"ab248464d8524a9ace5b7860054cf8c3","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/sites/galilee-north/golan/","publishdate":"2023-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/sites/galilee-north/golan/","section":"sites","summary":"1-min Devo ","tags":["Golan"],"title":"Golan Heights","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Revelation Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Introduction The Jewish Revolt: Nero, Vespasian, and Josephus 2nd Temple Destruction Fulfills Prophecy Roman aftermath: Vespasian and Titus Domitian Domitian, John, and Patmos Conclusion: Relevance to Revelation Summary\nThis is going to be a supplement to our Revelation background series. We’re essentially going to take a look at significant events in the period between the Jewish Revolt of 66CE, including the destruction of the Jewish Temple in 70, through the mid-90s that resulted in John’s exile on Patmos, where he received the Revelation. Even if history wasn’t your best subject in school, I think you’ll find this helpful as we prepare to study Revelation.\nVideo\nIntroduction Other than Jesus predicting the temple’s destruction in Luke 21, all of this is drawn from extra-biblical sources. Much of it is verifiable from historical documents. Still, some of it is based on church tradition that was likely passed on orally before it was written down several centuries later.\nThe church father, Iraneus, was only one generation removed from John the Apostle. Iraneus in ecclesiastical history¸is the earliest source that tells us that John the Apostle wrote Revelation and did so from Patmos because the Roman Emperor Domitian exiled him.\nDomitian’s persecution turns out to be critically important if we are to put Revelation in context. The following is summarized mainly from Cargill’s Jerusalem the Holy City course1 and Lancaster’s series Apocalypse of John2 and Chronicles of the Apostles3.\nThe years following Jesus’ Resurrection and Ascension were a tumultuous time for Israel The governors that followed Pontius Pilate went from bad to worse, as did the Herods that took over for Antipas and Phillip, notably Agrippa I and Agrippa II With this came increased talk of rebellion and hopes for a Messianic deliverer In many Jew’s minds, the Messiah will deliver the people from captivity and establish a literal political kingdom, just like Moses did during the Exodus. Since Jesus didn’t do that, He couldn’t be the promised deliverer4. False messiahs were abundant. This led to what is known as the “First Jewish Revolt” in 66 CE. The Jewish Revolt: Nero, Vespasian, and Josephus In 66 CE, during the time of Emperor Nero (famous for his own persecutions and insanity), there was open rebellion; a Roman General named Vespasian (pictured at right) was sent with Roman Legions V, X, and XV to quash it. Josephus predicts greatness for Vespasian. During one battle in the north of Israel, Vespasian captured a Jewish general named Yosef ben Mattiyahu, who later became known as Flavius Josephus. As he was about to be executed, Josephus said to Vespasian something along the lines of, “I’m not really a general. I’m a prophet, and one day you’re going to be the emperor.” Most Roman leaders were extraordinarily superstitious. Naturally, what this man said was pleasing to Vespasian’s ears; therefore, Josephus was allowed to live as an enslaved person. He authored two large volumes of Jewish history up to that point. In 69, while dealing with the Jewish rebellion, Vespasian was recalled to Rome, where he was indeed named emperor. Josephus also told Vespasian that amid all this Jewish messianic enthusiasm, it was Vespasian and his line who fulfilled the Jewish prophecies about the coming Messiah, not some Jewish person from the house of David. After Vespasian became emperor, they took Jewish prophecies very seriously! Josephus was still very much in the picture some 10-20 years later, when Vespasian’s son Domitian took over the Roman Empire. Josephus is viewed as a traitor to the Jews for his actions. According to legend, a group of generals entered into a suicide pact rather than be captured. Josephus conveniently drew the proverbial last straw and was tasked with killing the last man and then himself. He obviously took another way when he presented himself to Vespasian. Vespasian’s son Titus ultimately was successful in putting down the rebellion. In 70, he besieged and sacked Jerusalem and destroyed the Temple stone-by-stone, just as Jesus had predicted. In 72, he rooted out the last Jewish holdouts at a place called Masada Those Jews who were not slaughtered were forced into exile The Jews would not have a homeland to call their own until 1948. 2nd Temple Destruction Fulfills Prophecy Luke 19:41-44 As He drew near and saw Jerusalem, He wept over her, 42. saying, \u0026#34;If only you had recognized this day the things that lead to shalom! But now they are hidden from your eyes. 43. For the days will come upon you when your enemies will surround you with barricades and hem you in on all sides. 44. And they will smash you to the ground—you and your children within you. And they won\u0026#39;t leave within you one stone upon another because you did not recognize the time of your visitation. Jesus’ words about the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple were fulfilled in 70 CE Indeed, not one stone was left upon another.

God forms the human body from the dust of the earth, and blows into his nostrils a “living soul.” Originally Man is a single person, but deciding that “it is not good that man be alone,” God takes a “side” from the man, forms it into a woman, and marries them to each other. Adam and Eve are placed in the Garden of Eden, and commanded not to eat from the “Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.”1\nGen 2:1-3 – Shabbat Rest Gen 2:1-2 Reference Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.\nAnd on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.\nRev 21:1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.\nJoh 19:30 When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, “It is finished,”\nRev 21:6 And he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment.\nCol 1:16 For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him.\nEph 3:8-9 To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things,\nMaimonides, a medieval Jewish sage states, “the Creator caused a repose to encompass the universe.”2 Perhaps this is when time actually began as the laws of nature were stabilized.\nThere is no stated “evening and morning” for the seventh day. It was intended to be permanent.\nAdam and Eve’s decision disrupted this.\nFor our shabbat rest, we now look forward to the messianic age and the New heavens/New earth/New Jerusalem.\nJesus promises us our Shabbat rest in Rev 21:6\nPsa 90:4 For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, or as a watch in the night.\nThe sages applied Psalms 90.4 to Shabbat and concluded that, since every day is as a 1000 years, there will be 6000 years of work, followed by a Shabbat rest of 1000 years corresponding to the Messianic rule.\nRev 20:4 Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. Also, I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.\nMessianic Jews see a hint of this in the seven words of Genesis 1:1, which we discussed previously.\nבראשׁית ברא אלהים את השׁמים ואת הארץ\nGen 2:3 Reference So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation. Heb 4:9-11 So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God, [10] for whoever has entered God\u0026#39;s rest has also rested from his works as God did from his. [11] Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience.\nJoh 1:10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him.\nHebrews 4 has an exposition of the Shabbat rest:\nHeb 4:1-11 Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it. [2] For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened. [3] For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, “As I swore in my wrath, ‘They shall not enter my rest,’” although his works were finished from the foundation of the world. [4] For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.” [5] And again in this passage he said, “They shall not enter my rest.” [6] Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience, [7] again he appoints a certain day, “Today,” saying through David so long afterward, in the words already quoted, “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.” [8] For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken of another day later on.

This is all one sentence in Greek as it is in English.\nIt is considered some of the highest academic/classical Greek in all of antiquity.\nPerhaps this introduction belies the letter’s importance to whoever Theophilus was.\nThis style will change abruptly in verse 5.\nEach of the Gospel writers is associated with one of the Four Living Creatures in Ezekiel 1 and Revelation 4 (Lion, Man, Ox, and Eagle)\nThese are also the standards for the camp of Israel (Numbers 2).\nCuriously, the assignment of each has not remained constant.\nWe saw John as the Eagle in the last lesson.\nOriginally Luke was associated with an Ox; today Mark gets the Ox because Mark portrays Jesus as the Servant of all, while Luke gets the Man because his gospel portrays Jesus as the Son of Man.\nThe photo is of Luke’s tomb in Ephesus and, you can see the Ox or Bull underneath the cross\nMost scholars pin the date of the book to the 80s or early 90s CE; however, the fact that Luke (and all of the Gospels) omit mention of the destruction of the Jewish Temple in 70 CE might suggest an earlier date.\nWho was Theophilus?\nTheo means God and Phileo means friendship love, so the name could mean “Lover of God.”\nPotentially it is a code name. People who followed the God of Israel (including Yeshua following Jews and Gentiles) weren’t especially popular in the second-half of the first-century. Revelation speaks in code to avoid Roman censors; it’s possible the letter is addressed to the “Lover of God” who would have been known in Luke’s circle but not widely known elsewhere.\nIt is typically thought that Luke’s gospel was commissioned to provide an authoritative Greek gospel for the growing number of believers in the Gentile world.\nLancaster notes that Josephus, a Jewish but pro-Roman historian, mentions (and archeology confirms) a high-priest by the name of Theophilus in the Apostolic Era.\nMissler believes Theophilus was a wealthy benefactor in one of Paul’s congregations who commissioned Luke and Acts for Paul’s trial in Rome.\nThis would be similar to a deposition or affidavit used in courts today.\nThe early date and formal first sentence would be consistent with such a purpose.\nLuke notes that his gospel is not the only gospel.\nLike a trial lawyer, he reviewed other documents and interviewed witnesses.\nLuke, who was a physician, was highly educated and credible; therefore, he could attest to the document’s authenticity.\nLuke makes the point that his is an “orderly account.”\nMany commentators take this to mean Luke’s is the most chronologically accurate of the four gospels.

He said to the woman, “Did God actually say, ‘You shall not eat of any tree in the garden’?” Rev 20:2 And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,\n2 Cor 11:3 But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ.\nEze 28:13-15 You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering, sardius, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, emerald, and carbuncle; and crafted in gold were your settings and your engravings. On the day that you were created they were prepared. [14] You were an anointed guardian cherub. I placed you; you were on the holy mountain of God; in the midst of the stones of fire you walked. [15] You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created, till unrighteousness was found in you.\nOK a talking snake is a bit unusual. According to Jewish legend, Lucifer was enraged at God’s decision to create man, whom Lucifer no doubt viewed as a threat to his own status (and still does) he departed from God’s council and inhabited the snake. The serpent may in fact be the first case of demon possession in Scripture. We aren’t told much about the fall of Satan/Lucifer. In fact Heiser asserts that the Satan of Job chapter 1 and the serpent here were not originally the same being. The Satan, which means accuser, appeared to be serving the role of a court-appointed prosecutor, a role that apparently did exactly what God wanted him to do. The word Satan never appears in the Torah. In fact, it’s only in 11 verses in Job, two verses in Zechariah and one verse in 1 Chronicles. The word “devil” never appears in the Hebrew Bible. Later in Jewish history, the serpent of Eden, the devil, and the Satan of Job become co-mingled. After Genesis 3, the word serpent is typically only used to mean a snake, not a supernatural fallen angel By the time of Revelation at the end of the 1st century, the serpent, the devil, and the satan are all the same entity.\nIsaiah 14 and Ezekiel 28 are the two chapters that give us some biography of Satan, with Ezekiel 28:13 stating he was in Eden.\nMissler says there are two basic errors we make regarding Satan (and Lancaster reports that throughout history, Judaism makes the same two errors):\nPretend he doesn’t exist.\nThis view holds that the devil is merely an abstraction or a symbol of man’s evil inclination.\nIn contrast, “he” authors evil and seizes upon every evil opportunity.”2\nHe was real in the life of Jesus.\nLive in fear of him.\nPeople who do this are paralized and see the devil as behind everything that is not right. 1 Jn 4:4 Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. The serpent uses the same basic approach as advertisers do today. FOMO. Fear of missing out. From the Wikipedia entry:\nFear of missing out (FOMO) The feeling of apprehension that one is either not in the know or missing out on information, events, experiences, or life decisions that could make one’s life better. FOMO is also associated with a fear of regret which may lead to concerns that one might miss an opportunity for social interaction, a novel experience, a memorable event, or a profitable investment.\nIt is characterized by a desire to stay continually connected with what others are doing, and can be described as the fear that deciding not to participate is the wrong choice.3\nIn this case, the FOMO was the chance to be like God.\nGen 3:2-3 Reference And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden,\nbut God said, ‘You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.’”\nRev 22:18-19 I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, [19] and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this …","date":1663891200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666313328,"objectID":"9a097aa2d061f05dd6c532f2dda5dd7e","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/genesis/gen1/gen03/","publishdate":"2022-09-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/genesis/gen1/gen03/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Genesis 3","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Bible Sites"],"content":"1-min Devo: Armageddon 1-min Devo: Megiddo to Nazareth Study: Views from Megiddo ","date":1656633600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674928816,"objectID":"0fd9b097d63ba1061cc3a02d6a178b96","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/sites/central/megiddo/","publishdate":"2022-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/sites/central/megiddo/","section":"sites","summary":"1-min Devo: Armageddon 1-min Devo: Megiddo to Nazareth Study: Views from Megiddo ","tags":["Jezreel Valley","Samaritan","Gideon","Elijah"],"title":"Megiddo","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Revelation Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Rev 1:1: The Revelation to Yeshua Rev 1:2: Bore Witness Rev 1:3: The Blessing Rev 1:4: Grace and Shalom Rev 1:5-6: Sevenfold Description of Yeshua Rev 1:7: He Comes In The Clouds Rev 1:8: The Aleph and the Tav Rev 1:9: Patmos Rev 1:10: In the Spirit on the Day of the Lord Rev 1:11: Write!

This is the revelation which God gave to Yeshua the Messiah, so that he could show his servants what must happen very soon. He communicated it by sending his angel to his servant Yochanan, 1:1 Daniel 2:28 but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream and the visions of your head as you lay in bed are these: 29 To you, O king, as you lay in bed came thoughts of what would be after this, and he who reveals mysteries made known to you what is to be. Allusions and Cross-References We believe your study of this amazing book will be greatly enhanced if you read and meditate on the allusions listed. A comprehensive listing for all 22 chapters, including cross-references from the Treasury of Scripture Knowledge, is in Appendix A1. As you hover over (or tap) on each verse, the text of the English Standard Version will appear. This is the Revelation We have several questions answered immediately in verse 1. Who wrote: John Who is it for: servants of Yeshua (not for unbelievers) Who is it about: Yeshua When should we study: immediately for the time is near As we noted in the introduction, this is one revelation, so the book’s name is Revelation, not “revelations.” John’s Hebrew name, Yochanan, means something like “blessed by God.” Although the original record we have is in Greek and John was multilingual, Jesus very likely communicated this in Hebrew, John’s primary language. Interestingly, Hebrew words for “revelation” and “exile” are linguistically related. גָלָה is the verb for “to reveal, uncover” and is pronounced “ga-LAH”; גָלוּת, “ga-LOOT,” is the word for exile. Jewish apocryphal writings, of which Revelation is included, tend to occur when the people were exiled by God, living outside the land when they were vulnerable to abuses by the pagan nations. As we mentioned in the introduction, one of the purposes of Jewish apocalyptic literature was for God to communicate to His people that He is still in control. Although things seem unfair now, a day is coming when God will set everything straight. To help capture the “Jewishness” of the book, we will be using the Complete Jewish Bible (CJB) paraphrase translation. No translation is perfect, and the CJB is not without problems. You can hover over any Bible reference and compare the English Standard Version (ESV). Often the King James Version does the best job at capturing the meaning of the Greek. God/Yeshua/Angel/Yochanan Note that we receive Revelation, “4th hand.” God gave it to Jesus, who gave it to an angel/messenger, who gave it to John, who wrote it down and communicated to the servants of Messiah.

Gen 5:1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God. Son of Abraham = means a Jew. Matthew wants us to know that Jesus is Jewish.\nSon of David is a clear Messianic title. Matthew wants us to know that Jesus is the Messiah.\nMatthew presents his genealogy in the Hebraic style of Genesis 5:1, which reads “this (is the) book of the generations of Adam” (although it is Luke, not Matthew, who presents us the lineage back to Adam).\nGenealogies were important legal documents to demonstrate lineage for the purposes of inheritance.\nHistorically records were kept in the temple.\nWhen it was destroyed in 70 CE so were most of the records.\nAs a result, ANYONE after 70 CE could claim to be descended from David and there would be no way to prove or disprove it. A few would-be messiahs in history even tried to fabricate their lineage.\nIn contrast, the claim for Jesus’ lineage was made when it could still have been checked.\nGen 17:7 And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you.\n2Sa 7:16 And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever.’”\nIf a candidate for Messiah is not a descendant from David AND Abraham, he is to be rejected.\nGod made eternal and unconditional covenants with both Abraham and David.\nMatthew 1:1 is the most important verse of the chapter as it establishes Jesus in both David’s line and Abraham’s line (with the remainder of the genealogy used to support the assertion.\nDeu 17:15 you may indeed set a king over you whom the LORD your God will choose. One from among your brothers you shall set as king over you. You may not put a foreigner over you, who is not your brother.\nAny king, including, and especially the Messiah had to be Jewish by law.\nWe have an interesting Juxtaposition between Jesus, the rightful king, and King Herod, the presently reigning king.\nThis dichotomy is accented by geography. Above is a picture of Herod’s palace called Herodium (of course he named it after himself). Herodium is about 3 miles from Bethlehem.\nTo varying degrees, all of the gospels portray Jesus the rightful king, messiah, and Son battling against the usurping forces, be they Herod, the political/religious establishment or the forces of spiritual darkness.\nHerod, was NOT BORN King of the Jews, in two ways:\n1. He’s wasn’t Jewish by birth. He was an Idumean, which is to say an edomite, descended from Esau not Jacob. If you know anything about the history, the Edomites and the Israelites didn’t get along at all. During the period of the Maccabees, Herod’s family was forced to convert. Forced conversions, whether done by the greeks under Antiochus IV, the Jews under the Maccabeans, or the Christians and Muslims in later years, never seem to work out very well for both the converted and those forcing the conversions.\n2. He therefore was not qualified to be King. In fact, he approached the Roman Senate to grant him that title, which they did in 39 BC. And in an irony of History, Rome didn’t even control the area at the time. The Parthians did. Herod pushed them out and secured the area for Rome.\nThis adds some possible intrigue to Mat …","date":1615161600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665151589,"objectID":"41a3c710c196d4b4948830c028341d45","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb1/gb03/","publishdate":"2021-03-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb1/gb03/","section":"commentary","summary":"GENEALOGIES demonstrates to us that Jesus is of the “house and lineage” of King David.

Cain quarrels with Abel and murders him, and becomes a rootless wanderer with wicked descendants. A third son, Seth, is born to Adam. Enoch, the 7th from Adam walked with God, then was taken up without dying. Noah, the tenth from Adam, is the only righteous man in a corrupt world.\nVideo\nGenesis 4 Genesis 4:1-5 THE BIRTH OF CAIN AND ABEL Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, “I have gotten a man with the help of the LORD.” And again, she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a worker of the ground.\nIn the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground, and Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering, but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his face fell.\nCain\nAdam and Eve believed Cain was the promised seed of the Messiah.\nOf course he forfeited any hope of this by his unholy actions.\nIsn’t it like us to expect prophecy to be fulfilled in our day and age?\nThe offering\nUp until this point, no offerings were documented as being required, although there could have been such a requirement that wasn’t written down.\nIt is reasonable to assume this is not the first time they offered something – at some point, they must have been taught the right way and the wrong way to do it.\nJewish tradition holds that Adam went to Jerusalem after being banished from the Garden and built the first altar on Mount Moriah.\nTherefore, tradition says that all of this took place on Mount Moriah, the place we know today as the Temple Mount.\nFirst documented religious service; first competition; first murder. These three things are interconnected. When the irreligious see the bad behavior of believers, they naturally want no part of it.1\nIt’s been said that Christianity is not a religion, it’s a relationship\nA personal relationship with God and Jesus – Deuteronomy 6:5\nA personal commitment to love our neighbors as ourselves – Leviticus 19:18\nAbel accepted and Cain rejected\nWas it because Cain didn’t offer blood?\nNo. This may be an example of Christians knowing just enough about the Levitical sacrificial system to be dangerous.\nBoth grain and meat offerings are later commanded by God, and the Torah explicitly allows a person to bring a grain offering instead of an animal sacrifice for a sin offering.2\nIn fact, the word used in Genesis 4:3-5 is mincha, which is most closely associated with the grain offering in Leviticus 2.3\nCain’s occupation was a worker of the ground – he would be expected to bring an offering from the produce grown.\nI tithe in dollars not pounds, because my income is in dollars.\nSomeone in England would not be expected to tithe in dollars.\nThus, the position that Abel’s meat offering was favored solely because it was a meat offering may have some typological merit in that foreshadows Jesus’ sacrifice, but it has little basis in fact.\nWe should always let the Bible be our first go-to reference.\nThe Apostolic writings often provide more detail than we are given in the Hebrew Bible.\nIn this situation, John and the writer to the Hebrews tell us exactly why Cain’s offering was rejected.\nHeb 11:4 By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, through which he was commended as righteous, God commending him by accepting his gifts. And through his faith, though he died, he still speaks.\n1 Jn 3:12 We should not be like Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother’s righteous.\nThe biblical answer to why Abel’s sacrifice was accepted Is as follows:\nAbel’s offering was accepted because he was a righteous person.\nCain’s offering was rejected because he was a wicked person.\nIn other words, we can reasonably conclude that Cain had something in his heart that polluted his gift to God. Isa 29:13 And the Lord said: “Because this people draw near with their mouth and honor me with their lips, while their hearts are far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment taught by men,\nGod would rather not have any offering than one made with a polluted heart.\nIt’s the same with us.\nMat 5:23-24 “So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First, be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.”\nWe aren’t required to bring any offers, such as a tithe, but …","date":1663977600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666313328,"objectID":"7ba91a2d3070c81a448d7a9bb463e8e5","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/genesis/gen1/gen04/","publishdate":"2022-09-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/genesis/gen1/gen04/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Genesis 4 \u0026 5","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Revelation Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Daniel 7 and 10 Rev 1:12: Gold Menorah Rev 1:13: One Like a Son of Man Rev 1:14: Head, Hair, and Eyes Rev 1:15: Feet and Voice Rev 1:16: Right Hand, Mouth, and Face Rev 1:17: Fear not!

Summary\nVideo\nDaniel 7 and 10 The so-called “Vision of the Risen Christ” in Revelation 1:12-18 has several similarities (and key differences) with Daniel 7 and Daniel 10. It is beneficial to read the Daniel passages before we begin a verse-by-verse study of the remainder of Revelation 1.\nIn the Daniel passages, focus on the depictions of the “Ancient of Days” and the “Son of Man” in Daniel 7:9-14, and then the description of the unnamed angel in Daniel 10:5-10.\nDaniel 7 (1) In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head as he lay in his bed. Then he wrote down the dream and told the sum of the matter. (2) Daniel declared, “I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea. (3) And four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another. (4) The first was like a lion and had eagles’ wings. Then as I looked its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and the mind of a man was given to it. (5) And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side. It had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, ‘Arise, devour much flesh.’ (6) After this I looked, and behold, another, like a leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back. And the beast had four heads, and dominion was given to it. (7) After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns. (8) I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.\n(9) “As I looked, thrones were placed, and the Ancient of Days took his seat; his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames; its wheels were burning fire. (10) A stream of fire issued and came out from before him; a thousand thousands served him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the court sat in judgment, and the books were opened. (11) “I looked then because of the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking. And as I looked, the beast was killed, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire. (12) As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time. (13) “I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. (14) And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed.

When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. Heb 7:26 For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.\nGen 3:15 I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.”\nUp until now, miraculous births in the Bible still required a male/female union.\nGreek traditions (as well as Genesis 6) speak of gods impregnating women but nothing about the text indicates Mary’s conception was in any way sexual.2\nGod spoke the universe into existence. He created Eve from Adam’s rib.\nHe could have achieved Mary’s pregnancy by speaking it or any number of other “contactless” ways.\nAt a minimum, The Virgin Birth removes the stain of sin (often called original sin) that occurs whenever a human x and human y chromosome merge. Hebrews 7 reminds us that Jesus is “holy, innocent, unstained and separated from sinners.”\nAnother tidbit about the Virgin Birth. In Genesis 3:15 God says to the serpent, “I will put enmity between your seed and HER seed.”\nThe “seed of the woman” is one of the many names of the Jewish Messiah.\nThis is a seemingly biological contradiction. The seed is in the man.\nWay back in Genesis, many scholars believe we have a hint of the virgin birth.\nWells and Caves\nEastern tradition (Greek, Russian orthodox, etc.) holds that the annunciation occurred at this well, in keeping with the rich tradition of momentous events happening at wells or springs throughout scripture. Abraham, Jacob, Gideon, and even Jesus in John 4 has the famous meeting with the Samaritan woman at the well.3\nWestern (Roman Catholic) tradition holds that the annunciation was in a cave that today is venerated at the Catholic Church of the Annunciation in Nazareth. Caves are also prominent in the Bible with Abraham purchasing the cave at Machpelah in Hebron as a burial place, David establishing his superiority over Saul in a cave (though he later regretted it), Elijah, before he killed the priests of Baal, he found them hiding in caves, John the Baptist traditionally lived in caves, and it is widely believed that both the birth of Jesus and the events described in the Garden of Gethsemane both took place in caves. 4 Matthew 1:19 References And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. Tzadik – צַדִּיק – righteous one; not sinless but in the sense of Michah 6:8\nMicah 6:8 He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you? but to do justice, and to love kindness (mercy), and to walk humbly with your God.\nDeu 22:23-24 “If there is a betrothed virgin, and a man meets her in the city and lies with her, then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones, the young woman because she did not cry for help though she was in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbor\u0026#39;s wife. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.\nMat 5:32 But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.\nRom 12:7 Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all.\nJust as the Spirit wanted us to know that Zechariah was righteous, He wants us to know that Joseph was righteous.\nAgain, the Hebrew word for a righteous one is tzadik. Abraham was a tzadik, Boaz was a Tsadik and here Joseph is a Tzadik\nWhen you read proverbs and it says the righteous do such and such but the wicked do such and such, the word for righteous is almost always tsadik.\nTo be a tzadik does not require sinless perfection, but it essentially means the person is living out Deuteronomy 6:5, love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, might and Leviticus 19:18 Love your neighbor as yourself.\nBoth of these are restated in Micah 6:8, He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you? but to do justice, and to love kindness (mercy), and to walk humbly with your God.\nJesus gives …","date":1615248000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666803615,"objectID":"edfac396f9699a2a3cafef307410c113","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb1/gb04/","publishdate":"2021-03-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb1/gb04/","section":"commentary","summary":"In NATIVITY focuses exlusively on Joseph.

Five miles from Jerusalem, Bethlehem serves as the birthplace of David and King Messiah. Close by at Migdal Eder, a group of shepherds is startled by an angel who announces the birth of the Messiah. The new family makes their first trip to the Temple in Jerusalem, where they encounter a holy man and a prophetess.\nVideos\nLuke 2:1-20: Luke 2:21-38: Bethlehem Supplement: Following the Messiah: Geographic Setting: Luke 2 is our first encounter where geography plays a significant supporting role in our understanding of the Gospels. In just about every remaining chapter in the Gospels, we will want to pause to understand the geographic background.\nThis satellite photo shows two possible travel routes from Nazareth to Bethlehem1. The more direct route would take them through Samaria along the Way of the Patriarchs. In other words, this is the same road that Abraham and Jacob traveled frequently. It’s about 70 miles to Jerusalem going this way. While we’re often taught that Jews and Samaritans avoided each other at all costs, it was not unheard of for Jews to use this road. Luke doesn’t tell us which way they traveled, but we know Jesus traveled the shorter route on at least one occasion in John 4.\nThe way around would take travelers from Galilee, through the Jezreel valley, around Mt. Gilboa, where they would follow the Jordan down to Jericho. At Jericho, they would hang a right to make the grueling climb along the Ascent of Adummim up to Jerusalem. The photo below shows the climb from 800-1200 feet below sea level at Jericho (depending on where you measure) to 2500 feet above at Jerusalem.2 Going in this direction added an extra 20 miles to the journey and required fording the Jordan a couple of times. We know for sure Jesus traveled this way as He made His way up to Jerusalem for the final time of His earthly ministry after he met with Zacchaeus and Bartimaeus in Jericho.\nThere are several examples Luke paints a very different picture of “the Christmas story” than many of us have grown up with. We call these “Christmyth Busters.”\nChristmyth: A December birth for Jesus is unlikely.\nOne large problem with assuming a December birth is that the dirt roads would have been nearly impassable in early winter because of the snow, rain, and mud. If we assume they took the long route along the Jordan – ~90 miles, the Jordan river would have been swollen and the banks flooded. In short, it is unlikely that a roman administrator in his right mind would have conducted a census at this time of year (think of the alps in Italy and the mountains in Turkey). To be fair, not all Roman emperors were in their right minds although that charge has never been leveled against Augustus.\nAs we mentioned in Annunciations, there is strong tradition to suggest John the Baptist was born in the spring, which means Jesus would have been borm six months later in the early fall.\nLuke 2:1-3 References In those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria. And all went to be registered, each to his own town. Act 5:37 After him Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and drew away some of the people after him. He too perished, and all who followed him were scattered. While Matthew gives us only a brief overview regarding Jesus’ actual birth – remember his only mention was in Matthew 1:24; everything after that verse is AFTER his birth – Luke will give us a lot more detail. We said in Luke 1 that Luke’s intent is to give us an orderly account. Luke is focused on who Jesus was, so we’re going to get a lot of detail about the human side of Jesus.\nScholars and skeptics have a problem with Luke’s dating of the Quirinius census to AD 6, which would have been way too late to have occurred at the time of Jesus’ birth. King Herod died in 4 BC, so Jesus’ birth had to be before Herod’s death. The problem is we have no historical evidence of a census that occurred during the later stages of Herod’s life. We must remember that “absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.” This is the fallacy the skeptics are engaging in with their argument. They’re assuming Luke made an error, for which we similarly have no evidence.\nFrom the Bible itself, Acts 5:37 tells us that Luke knew exactly when the AD6 census was because he references it directly. Again this is one of those instances where the Narrative would have been just fine with “Judas the Galilean rose up and drew away some of the people” but the Holy Spirit adds “in the days of the census.” This, in my opinion, is the Holy Spirit …","date":1663891200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666803615,"objectID":"c51c89ee995e7ad14d4cd2c2a88a7193","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb1/gb04b/","publishdate":"2022-09-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb1/gb04b/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Nativity II - Luke 2:1-38","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["inSITES"],"content":"1-min Devo: ","date":1674777600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674928816,"objectID":"a6b6a8db49be34eaa530ffd51b34a44f","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/sites/jerusalem/southsteps/","publishdate":"2023-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/sites/jerusalem/southsteps/","section":"sites","summary":"1-min Devo: ","tags":[],"title":"Southern Temple Steps","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["inSITES"],"content":"1-min Devo: ","date":1674777600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674928816,"objectID":"4754020c781b352795fd7a634311c4ea","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/sites/galilee-north/tabgha/","publishdate":"2023-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/sites/galilee-north/tabgha/","section":"sites","summary":"1-min Devo: ","tags":[],"title":"Tabgha","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["inSITES"],"content":"1-min Devo: ","date":1673395200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674928816,"objectID":"8c21ae43365027ead4ee357275381648","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/sites/judah-south/mareshah/","publishdate":"2023-01-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/sites/judah-south/mareshah/","section":"sites","summary":"1-min Devo: ","tags":[],"title":"Bet Guvrin / Mareshah","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["inSITES"],"content":"Study: Shechem Practically every waking moment of our lives, we are making choices.

He who has an ear Application Pauline letter counterpart Matthew 13 Parable counterpart Church Age Theory This lesson will discuss the structure of each of the Seven Letters. We will also review several approaches to application including three conjectures.\nVideo\nIntro Our fifth lesson in Revelations backgrounds will introduce the seven letters in chapters 2-3. Each letter follows an intricate and nearly identical outline. Understanding this at the outset will help us as we seek to unpack each letter. Next, we will look at several application layers and the commonly taught “church age” conjecture. We will also look at the often confusing and misunderstood phrases, “the Nicolaitans,” “those who say they are Jews but are not,” and “the synagogue of Satan.” Since these phrases occur in multiple letters, we will deal with them upfront. Ultimately Scripture does not define these. We will strive to leverage what we ARE told from Scripture – and we do get some clues – with what was going on in that society at the time to make an educated guess that may be different from what is commonly taught. Acts 17:11 says, don’t take my word for it but test these theories to see whether these things could be so. As we mentioned in an earlier lesson, our job is not to tell you WHAT to think. It’s to get you TO think.\nThe Sevenfold Structure of Each Letter We will find that the letters follow a sequence of seven elements. 1. Name of the city (addressee), 2. An attribute of the Glorified Messiah from 1:12-20 (addresser), 3. Praise that usually begins with “I know…”, 4. Judgment, 5. Encouragement, 6. A promise to the overcomer, 7. “He who has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.”\nKeener notes: “Some scholars have compared the elements of the form to Old Testament and ancient Near Eastern covenant formulas; if they are correct, the prophecies here may act like the covenant lawsuits common in the Old Testament prophets (e.g., in Amos 2–4). They may also function analogously to a series of oracles against the nations common in the Old Testament prophets (e.g., Isaiah 13–23; Jer 46–51; Ezek 25–32; especially the eight brief oracles of Amos 1–2).”1 We examine each element in greater detail and describe more about the judgment aspect, as commentators often overlook this.\n1. Name of the City (1) “To the angel of the Messianic Community in Ephesus, write: ‘Here is the message…\nThe first element is always addressed to the angel of the assembly at each of the cities. We’ve mentioned in previous lessons that there is scholarly debate as to whether the angel is supernatural or is a human messenger. For our purposes, it doesn’t matter as the body of each letter deals with the behaviors of the human body of believers.\nThe meaning of the city’s name often is revealing. For example, Ephesus means “darling” or “darling one,” yet this is the church that lost its first love, and the Greek word used is Agape, a completely devoted type of love.\nAs we go through each city in subsequent Revelation Background lessons, we will present some of the background history, enhancing our understanding of what God communicates to the fellowship. Keener writes, “Ancient cities were fiercely proud of their own history and culture and would be more sensitive to local allusions than most readers today would be.”2\n2. A specific attribute of Messiah ‘Here is the message from the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven gold menorahs: The second element is a specific attribute of the one who is sending the letter. The speaker is never identified as Jesus, but we’ll say it’s Jesus the Messiah in his risen and glorified form even though we know John received the revelation through an angel.\nThe attributes typically tie back to the description of this heavenly being in Revelation 1:12-20. There is one slight deviation in the letter to Philadelphia where He says He has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens. Revelation 1:18 mentions the Keys to death and hades but not the Key of David. Any deviations should get our attention. We’ll unpack this when we get to Philadelphia.\n3. Specific Praise that begins with “I know….” (2) “I know what you have been doing, how hard you have worked, how you have persevered, and how you can’t stand wicked people; so you tested those who call themselves emissaries but aren’t—and you found them to be liars. (3) You are persevering, and you have suffered for my sake without growing weary. The third attribute in each letter is praise. If I read this like an audit report from my corporate auditing days, this would be an attribute that was tested and found to have met the standard.

Twelve-year-old Yeshua is reluctant to leave His Father’s house in the holy city.\nRead/hear the portions: Matthew 2 | Luke 2:39-52\nTable of Contents Videos Talmidim Way Backgrounds Following the Messiah - Appian Media Geographical overview. The Magi honor the King The Flight to Egypt “Passover” Exodus Jesus at the Temple Application Videos Talmidim Way Backgrounds Following the Messiah - Appian Media Geographical overview. Matthew’s narrative includes the visit of the Magi from the “east” – scholars think it’s either Parthia/Persia or Arabia. In general, the Euphrates separated the Parthian from the Roman empire. Frankincense and Myrrh are associated more with Arabia, but this doesn’t mean the Magi had to come from Arabia, although they certainly could have. We’re going to see that Herod and all Jerusalem was in an uproar, which to some suggests Herod may have thought a Parthian invasion was imminent. (Three guys on camels would not cause an uproar, but we’ll bust that Christ myth a bit later!). After the Magi’s visit, the Holy Family flees to Egypt. We aren’t told where, but Alexandria is a fair assumption because of the significant Jewish population there.\nIn a sense the whole bible is about usurpers, starting back in Genesis 3 with the serpent tricking man into thinking that our way is better than God’s way. That deception still continues, not only in the geopolitical world around us but also within us individually. Herod is the phony king of the Jews who isn’t even Jewish, while Jesus is the rightful one who is BORN king of the Jews. Herod represents darkness while Jesus represents light. At this point in Matthew 2, the evil king is hunting down Yeshua, who must relocate to safety.\nWe believe Old Testament Joseph traveled along the Via Maris, the way of the sea, while Jacob and his family traveled along the way of the Patriarchs to Beersheba and then on down to Egypt. Given that Bethlehem lies along the way of the patriarchs, it’s reasonable to suspect the Holy Family used the same road as Jacob when they fled to Egypt.\nThe Magi are said to depart from Bethlehem a different way, which is to say they did not go back through Jerusalem.\nHerod died in 4 BC. After the sojourn in Egypt, the text appears their first choice would have been to go back to Bethlehem however the political situation – and the holy spirit – directed them back to Nazareth.\nArchelaus, who was now over Judea and Samaria (including Jerusalem) was every bit as ruthless as his father Herod was. He was so awful that Rome replaced him in AD 6 with the procurators. The procurator we know best is Pontius Pilate.\nArchelaus’ brother Antipas was over Galilee and Perea.\nAfter Matthew 2, whenever we read “Herod” or “Herod the Tetrarch” without further designation, that is referring to Herod Antipas. Antipas is the Herod at the end of Jesus’ life who asks for a miracle. When Jesus stays silent (Refusing to acknowledge his authority), Antipas mocks him and sends him back to Pilate.\nThe Magi honor the King Matthew 2:1-2 References Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, “Where is he who has been born king of the Ioudaioi? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.” Num 24:17 I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near: a star shall come out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel; it shall crush the forehead of Moab and break down all the sons of Sheth.\nGen 3:15 I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.”\nIsa 2:6 For you have rejected your people, the house of Jacob, because they are full of things from the east\nMagi were gentile/ pagan astrologers whose divinatory skills were widely respected in the Greco-Roman world; astrology had become popular through the “science” of the East. According to Keener, “everyone agreed that the best astrologers lived in the East.” Isaiah acknowledges this in Isa 2:6.\nAs we have mentioned, there is a possible dig at Herod when they ask, “where is He that is BORN king of the Jews?”. Herod was appointed by Rome. They could be saying “where is the REAL king?” Even if they didn’t mean it as an insult, it is likely Herod took it as such.\nThat messiah would be signified by a star goes back to Numbers 24 and a prophecy by Balaam, also a gentile.\nOne of Matthew’s points is that gentiles who would otherwise have no interest in a Jewish messiah make the trek across the lands to come bow to\nHim, while in verse 5, the religious who should …","date":1618963200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665151589,"objectID":"f189d619a9d7ebd85f3555370fc558f4","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb1/5-the-nazarene/","publishdate":"2021-04-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb1/5-the-nazarene/","section":"commentary","summary":"In THE NAZARENE, Joseph and Mary return to the remote village of Nazareth overlooking the Jezreel Valley and Mount Tabor.

But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. Bolen: “Paul describes the opposition between fleshly desires and spiritual desires in terms that are almost war-like.”1\nGenesis 6:4 References The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown. Num 13:33 And there we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim), and we seemed to ourselves like grasshoppers, and so we seemed to them.”\nJude 6 And the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day—\nLuke 17:27 They were eating and drinking and marrying and being given in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.\nA plain reading of the first four verses indicates that angelic beings, “sons of God,” descended to earth and had relations with human women, creating a half-breed race called the Nephilim.\nAdmittedly, this is bizarre to conceptualize and awkward to discuss in polite company.\nThus, several alternate theories have arisen in order to have the text mean anything other than what it actually says.\nPeter, Jude, and likely all of the apostles, followed the plain text reading, which is also recorded in the book of 1 Enoch.\nNephilim means the fallen ones, as in fallen angels. Heiser covers this topic extensively in his book “The Unseen Realm.”\nNumbers 13:33 indicates the Nephilim were giants and Jewish tradition says they committed all types of violence and sexual abominations and even became cannibals.\nIn Greek the term is gigantes, which makes us think of “giants” but the root word is actually gigas, which means “earth-born.”\nNote the Nephilim were on the earth “After that.”\nGenesis 14, 15 Rephaim\nNumbers 13:33 Anakin\nDeut 3:11 Og, King of Bashan\n1 Samuel 17 Goliath (and his four brothers) the Philistine\nCuriously, Bashan is the Golan Heights at the foot of Mt.

And the LORD regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. So the LORD said, “I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.” Rom 3:23-24 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,\nRom 7:18-19 For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh.

Its location meant it could serve as an essential waypoint from Rome to the eastern provinces, either by sea or land. A network of Roman roads connected the seven messianic assemblies. They also eventually linked up with routes leading to Asia proper, including Israel, the Fertile Crescent, and Africa.\nDuring the Roman Empire, Ephesus was a significant harbor village. On the map inset, you can see estimations of the shoreline from 500 BCE to 60 CE to the present. The change was caused by dramatic silting from the Cayster River, making the modern harbor useless. The photo below the map shows the swampy area of the Roman port today. This photograph shows the Great Theater (with seating up to 25,000) with the street that led to the now silted harbor. Acts 19:21-41 describes a riot that occurred when devotees of Diana/Artemis said that Paul posed a clear and present danger to their way of life. The theater is where the riot took place.\nThe harbor street (shown in the center of the picture) would have been lined with shops on both sides.1 There was also a large “agora,” or marketplace adjacent. “This would have been the likeliest place…for Aquila, Priscilla, and Paul to have set up shop for their long stay in Ephesus.”2 DeSilva also notes the market “was a major note in the flow of goods from the East to Rome. Many of the cargoes listed in Rev 18:12-13 could be found arriving in Ephesus from the East for further transportation west.”3 We need to imagine how difficult it would have been to live life as a set-apart believer in a thoroughly pagan environment like Ephesus.\nEphesus secular history Scholars believe Hittites founded Ephesus in 1400 BCE. Archeologists have excavated remains of an early temple to a mother goddess, a Hittite fertility deity that later morphed into Diana/Artemis. If the name “Hittite” rings a bell, Uriah, one of David’s mighty men, was a Hittite. Uriah had a beautiful wife named Bathsheba.\nEphesus repeatedly picked the wrong side in the Peloponnesian, Persian, and Roman wars. Still, it became a favored city under Rome and competed with Pergamum (and Smyrna to a lesser extent) over which city was most favored by Rome.\nEphesus and Artemis The temple to Artemis/Diana was one of the famous “Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.” With a footprint of 220’ x 425’, It is four times larger than the Parthenon in Athens4. It was first built in the mid-6th century BCE atop previous temples dating to the 8th century (the time of King Hezekiah in Judah). Artemis, called Diana by the Romans, was the virgin goddess of the moon, fertility, and nature. Our “mother nature” myth likely comes from her. Artemis is the earth goddess, nurturing and fertile. As we can see in the photo,5 Artemis is depicted as multi-breasted (or multiple eggs, also a symbol of fertility). She can also be cruel, vindictive, and destructive.6\nLooking at the map above, we can see that the temple was situated about a mile outside the central Roman city. Bolen writes, \u0026#34; This makes sense, given Artemis’s identity as a goddess of the wilds.”7 Fertility rites involving temple prostitutes were shared, which Paul disrupted in the New Testament period. It appears to have been destroyed around 400 CE. Today not much remains of the site except for a conspicuous pillar.\nThis coin[^9] from AD 50 shows how much the city identified with Diana, down to its very economy. This is why the townspeople saw Paul not only as a religious threat but also as an economic one.

We turn our attention away from palaces and politics to seek a prophet, the voice of one calling in the wilderness. We find John the Immerser preaching on the other side of the Jordan River, near Bethany. John prepares the way through immersion and repentance. The waters of the Jordan River run with history and spiritual significance. Those waters have served as a place of renewal for the people of Israel more than once. The people seeking the prophet and his immersion must cross over its waters again to re-enter the land with a new heart and new commitment to God.\nVideo\nA word on the lesson title In messianic Jewish circles, John the Baptist is often referred to as “John the immerser.” The reason for this is the term “Baptist” has become somewhat of a charged term theologically (positively and negatively). Immersion reminds us that Christian baptism has its roots in Jewish ritual immersion in a pool of “living water” (either a spring-fed river or lake, or a cistern used to collect rainwater) and is not an entirely new practice.\nThe time of the beginning Mat 3:1 Mar 1:1,4 Luk 3:1-2 In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God…John appeared baptizing in the wilderness In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness. Augustus was the Caesar at the time of Jesus’ birth; in 14 he was succeeded by Tiberius. If we assume Luke is counting from the beginning of Tiberius’ reign as Emperor (which is only an assumption) 15th year would place us in 27/28. Other commentators use other dates to come up with anywhere from 26-30 CE/AD. This results in a crucifixion date between 29-33 CE being defendable. Often the date one picks for the start of His ministry depends on the bias one holds regarding a Friday crucifixion and the Daniel 9 prophecy – we’ll get to both of those questions much later in our study. Unless you need a topic for a PhD thesis in seminary, I recommend we hold dates VERY loosely there’s a lot of ambiguity with calendar conversions and dating methods. Luke says Jesus was ”about thirty” when He started his ministry – if He started in the year 28, he would have been in his mid-30s (remember He had to be born prior to 4 BC when Herod the great died).\nThe region of Judea, Samaria and Idumea was first given to Archelaus, who as we mentioned last time fits the modern definition of a train wreck. He was deposed in 6 CE and was exiled. At this time Rome brought in Governors or Procurators, All Rome asked of its citizens was “pay your taxes and don’t revolt”. The procurators were tasked with seeing to both things. The procurators were headquartered at the palace in Caesarea but tended to visit Jerusalem during the feast days where large numbers of Jews (most of whom hated Rome) congregated.\nAt the time of Jesus, the procurator was Pontius Pilate. Some scholars doubted Pilate’s existence until a stone with an inscription referencing Pontius pilate prefect of Judea was found at Caesarea. The stone was found in the theater at Caesarea upside down. Even back then they were into recycling. Pontius Pilate was appointed governor of Judea in AD 26/27, and he held the post until March of AD 37. This inscription was found in secondary use in the theater of Caesarea. A suggested restoration reads: “Pontius Pilate, Prefect of Judea, made and dedicated the Tiberium to the Divine Augustus.” The stone is the first and only mention of Pilate from an archaeological source. Today a replica is on display at the national park in Caesarea and the original is in the Israel Museum.\nHerod Philip had the northern districts including villages such as Bethsaida and Caesarea Philippi where Peter will later make his famous declaration. When asked “who do YOU say I am”, Peter answered, “you are the Messiah.” Jesus asks us that same question today and every day. In the Gospels, the scene at Caesarea Philippi is the high-water mark of sorts. Jesus would now begin to teach and repeat overtly that he would suffer and die. Both thematically as well as geographically, the rest of the gospels picture Jesus moving from Caesarea Philippi with Peter’s proclamation, which should have been EVERYONE’s proclamation, up to Jerusalem …","date":1619136000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666313328,"objectID":"2950cb0bf0d18526af659735f175985e","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb1/gb06/","publishdate":"2021-04-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb1/gb06/","section":"commentary","summary":"Table of Contents A word on the lesson title The time of the beginning The message and the messenger A specimen of John’s preaching The forerunner’s picture of the Messiah before seeing Him Archived Video Portions:","tags":["Luke 3","Matthew 3","Mark 1","John 1"],"title":"6.

After all, they were written thousands of years ago in a place that, for most of us, is thousands of miles away. Yad Hashamonah is a recreated Biblical Village that helps us view our Bible in the proper context. A place like this reminds us that the Bible describes real people and events that actually happened, and more importantly, God cares about them. Yad Hashmonah teaches us that our great God who created the universe is still interested in the minor details of your life and mine.\nIn our January 2023 trip, we studied Deuteronomy 8. God desires a “good land” and blessing for His people. He only asks for our obedience, which as we know is easier said than done. While not a historical biblical site, the working village (called a moshav) contains historically accurate reproductions of a synagogue, a winepress, a watchtower, a threshing floor, olive presses and burial caves. The garden includes olive trees, grape vines, biblical herbs such as hyssop, and a wheat field. When we read about these things, which are quite frequent in the Bible, our minds immediately can place three-dimensional objects on top of the two-dimensional text.\nDeuteronomy 8:7-14 “For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of streams of water, of fountains and springs, flowing out in valleys and hills; a land of wheat and barley, of vines, fig trees, and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey; a land where you will eat food without shortage, in which you will not lack anything; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you can dig copper. “When you have eaten and are satisfied, you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land which He has given you. “Be careful that you do not forget the LORD your God by failing to keep His commandments, His ordinances, and His statutes which I am commanding you today; otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, and you build good houses and live in them, and when your herds and your flocks increase, and your silver and gold increase, and everything that you have increases, then your heart will become proud and you will forget the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.\u0026#34;\nThe meaning of Yad HaShmonah “Yad Hashmona” means Memorial to the Eight. The name was given by the Finnish founding members in memory of the eight Jewish refugees, who escaped in 1938 from Austria to Finland, and who were handed over by the Finns to the Nazi Gestapo in November 1942. The Finnish founders wished to somehow atone, on behalf of the Finnish people, for handing over the eight Jews to the Nazis. They viewed their contribution to developing the Land of Israel as an act of restoration and forgiveness.\nWinepress: Matthew 21:33 “Hear another parable.

By this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.\nMat 11:28 Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest (Heb. noach).\nThe Hebrew command “bo” can mean either come or go. “Come into the ark” seems to fit the mood of God’s providing shelter and security through this significant trial upon the earth.\nAs we noted last lesson, God could have elected to wipe everything out and start over. Instead, He chose to fix it. Tikkun Olam.\nJustice demands not only that the wicked be punished, but the innocent/righteous not be punished along with the wicked.\nIn fact, only Noah is described as righteous, not his wife or sons.\nThey, presumably, were given a choice to follow Noah or not.\nThus a model for us is just as Noah’s family was saved on the basis of Noah’s righteousness, not their own, so too, if we follow Jesus, we are saved on the basis of His righteousness, not our own.\n“By virtue of being associated with Him and His righteousness, we are spared from the final judgment.”1\nWe can take this a step further. Does today’s world scoff at the Bible’s description of the second-coming of Jesus who brings an end-times judgment? Did the larger world scoff at Noah when he was building the ark?\n2Pe 3:3-6 knowing this first of all, that scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing, following their own sinful desires. [4] They will say, “Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation.” [5] For they deliberately overlook this fact, that the heavens existed long ago, and the earth was formed out of water and through water by the word of God, [6] and that by means of these the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished.\nMatthew 24:39 “…until the flood came and took them all away. So will the coming of the Son of Man be.”\nThe Bible uses flood imagery to describe the Tribulation period:\nDan 9:26 And the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end shall come with a flood, and to the end there shall be war. Desolations are decreed.\nRev 12:15 The serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, to sweep her away with a flood.\nGen 7:2-3 [2] Take with you seven pairs of all clean animals, the male and his mate, and a pair of the animals that are not clean, the male and his mate, [3] and seven pairs of the birds of the heavens also, male and female, to keep their offspring alive on the face of all the earth.\nAdditional clean animals are needed for sacrifices after the flood.2\nHere is an important insight. The Bible doesn’t provide every detail.\nIn the Text, clean and unclean designations do not occur until MUCH later (Lev 11:2-23).\nYet, “somehow” Noah knows which are clean vs unclean.\nEither God explained it to Noah directly, or perhaps He explained it to Adam, who passed it down.\nConversely, many (perhaps most) of the commands given at Sinai were not new to Moses. We might say they were codified as opposed to given for the first time.\nThere has not yet been permission given to eat meat (that won’t come until Gen 9:2, and even there, no distinction is made between clean and unclean animals), so the assumption is that clean animals were needed for sacrifice, not man’s diet.\nGen 7:4-5 [4] For in seven days I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, and every living thing that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground.” [5] And Noah did all that the LORD had commanded him.\nIt seems more likely that God sent the animals to Noah, versus Noah going out and fetching them.\nThe Jewish Targum says, “Behold, I give you the space of seven days; if they will repent they will be forgiven, but if they still will not repent, seven days from now, I will cause rain to come down upon the earth forty days and forty nights.”3\n“Blot out” is a good choice for the verb in verse 4. Some translations say “destroy” but “blot out” captures the essence of the word. Sinful man is to be violently erased without a trace, buried beneath the sea.\nGen 7:6-9 [6] Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came upon the earth. [7] And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him went into the ark to escape the waters of the flood.

He who wins the victory will not be hurt at all by the second death.” \u0026#39; Smyrna Background Geography and History Like Ephesus, Smyrna was a deep harbor town. This resulted in economic prosperity, though Smyrna was never as commercially significant as Ephesus. The map below shows Smyrna’s location respective to Ephesus and Pergamum. It’s about 42 miles north of Ephesus. Like Ephesus, the harbor eventually became silted over and the modern shoreline is a few miles to the west.\nUnlike Ephesus, which tended to pick the wrong side during the great imperial battles of antiquity, Smyrna did not. In fact, they were steadfastly loyal to Rome. This was true long before Rome came to power. They built a temple to Roma, the deified personification of Rome in 195 BCE, when Smyrna was in Greek hands.1\nStrabo, the great geographer of antiquity, indicated that the ancient Smyrnans believed their city to be the birthplace of Homer and had what they called a Homerium: a temple to Homer and a statue. Strabo also said that Smyrna was “the most beautiful city in Ionia.”2\nThe modern Turkish city of Izmir sits atop where we believe ancient Smyrna is. This has significantly limited archaeological excavation. Because of this, we are unable to confirm any Jewish/Christian presence in the city at the time Revelation was written. However as scholars will point out, “absence of evidence, is not evidence of absence.” Bolen points out the modern city of Izmir, “has a long history of Jewish residents, evidenced by the number of synagogues in the area of the historic city…at one time there were nine synagogues located on a single street.”3\nOut of all the seven cities mentioned in Revelation, only Smyrna (Izmir) survives as a continuously inhabited city.4\nThe Roman Imperial Cult Like Ephesus, the culture of Smyrna was deeply seated in the worship of what is called the Roman Imperial Cult. They were described as “being loyal to Rome and its gods, even unto death.” This is one of those likely local allusions (or maybe a better word is a ‘pun’) Jesus makes in Rev 2:10, when He says, “Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.”\nWe see an example of this in an inscription to Hadrian found at Smyrna. The dedication describes Hadrian as “Olympian, Savior, and Founder.” (Ὀλυμπίωι σωτῆρι καὶ κτίστηι).”5 By calling him “Olympian,” they are saying Hadrian is equivalent to Zeus. It is no accident that they used words challenging the status of Jesus as Savior. Even though Hadrian would have been after the time John wrote (this dedication dates to 128 CE), this is still illustrative of the culture the believers in Smyrna found themselves. Even though after the fact, labeling Hadrian as “founder” is in opposition to Jesus calling Himself “the First and the Last.”\nEmperor worship was mandatory. The law required citizens to make an annual offering and acknowledge publicly that Caesar was supreme lord. They received a certificate that they had done so, after which they were permitted to worship whatever gods they wanted. As we have noted, ethnic Jews were in a protected class and exempted from this by law, but gentile believers were not. This led to significant tensions between Jews (both believing and non-believing) and Gentile followers of Yeshua, the Jewish Messiah, with the former group being called to publicly denounce the latter. The lack of “proper papers” showing this group refused to worship Caesar added to the pressure believers and those protecting them were under (remember in Nazi Germany, those who aided and abetted Jews were sent to camps or killed on the spot the same as the Jews they helped).\nAs in Ephesus, there was a large area called an Agora that served as a civic forum and also had areas for shopping.

After His immersion, we follow Yeshua out into the dry and waterless Judean Wilderness between Jerusalem and Jericho where He spends forty days in prayer and fasting, concluding with His three temptations.2\nPassages: Matthew 3:13-4:11 (Mark 1:9-13, Luke 3:21-23, 4:1-13; John 1:29-34)\nVideo:\nTable of Contents Geography: Jesus baptized by John in the Jordan Fulfill all Righteousness The Spirit like a Dove The three temptations of Jesus Into the wilderness First temptation: stone to bread Second temptation: throw yourself down Third temptation: all the kingdoms of the world if you bow Worship me Conclusion: the devil departs Lessons from the Temptations Following the Messiah link Geography: This map3 traces Jesus’ early ministry, including leaving Nazareth to be baptized by John (Mark 1:9) leading to His baptism in the Jordan (box 1), followed by His temptation in the Judean wilderness (box 2). We don’t know exactly where (or when) Jesus was baptized. Because of a few references, including the apparent proximity to Jerusalem (Mark 1:5) and the reference to “these stones” in the Luke and Matthew accounts suggest opposite Jericho near (or quite probably at) the location where Joshua led the Israelites across in Joshua 4. This site is marked by a traditional holy site today.\nWhile not disputing a southern location for Jesus’ baptism, some scholars, including William Schlegel the publisher of this map, contend “Bethany beyond the Jordan” is not located across from Jericho but much further north in the Golan Heights (marked by box 3 on the map). They point out that it does not say that Jesus was baptized at Bethany; but in John’s gospel, it appears as if John is recollecting Jesus’ baptism which occurred at least 40 days earlier and in a different location.\nAubrey Taylor has noted that in the same region where Moses commissioned Joshua, and Elijah commissioned Elisha, Jesus receives a similar commission from John.4\nThe photo on the top5 is a colorized version of an American Colony photograph taken between 1896 and 1946. The photo on the bottom6 is the same area today. The most significant issue in that part of the world, since ancient times and continues today is water rights. Before 1948 the area was sparsely populated. After 1948 with the founding of both the modern states of Israel as well as Jordan, the area began to grow, and all those new people needed food and food requires water from the Jordan river.\nJesus baptized by John in the Jordan Mat 3:13-15 Mar 1:9 John 1:29-31 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. John would have prevented him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?” But Jesus answered him, “Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he consented. In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! This is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who ranks before me, because he was before me.’ I myself did not know him, but for this purpose I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel.” Although it’s only a few verses in our Bibles, we need to remember that John and Jesus had probably never met until this day (and unlikely that John would remember doing a somersault in his mother Elizabeth’s womb over 30 years earlier); however, John 1:31 could also be interpreted that John initially did not recognize that Jesus was the Messiah, not that they were entirely unfamiliar with each other.\nAlso, by now, we presume Joseph has died and Jesus has been left in charge of Mary and Jesus’ many siblings. John apparently recognized Jesus as soon as they saw each other and makes a Passover allusion to the sacrificial lamb and Isaiah 53:7: He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth. John is certainly foreshadowing Jesus’ suffering and crucifixion.\nLancaster paraphrases Matthew 3:14 as, “I need to be baptized by you WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT, yet you come to me to be baptized with water?”7\nFulfill all Righteousness Of course, Jesus Himself did not need to be baptized for his sins, so what does Jesus mean by “fulfilling all righteousness?” Keener notes that Jesus’ response indicates his identification with Israel in obedience to the Law and by extension, larger humanity who …","date":1620432000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667489436,"objectID":"36be600230627788500238edc1d58463","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb2/gb07/","publishdate":"2021-05-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb2/gb07/","section":"commentary","summary":"Summary:\nIn IMMERSION AND TEMPTATION, we briefly return to Nazareth.

Then the ark settles on Mount Ararat, and Noah dispatches a raven, and then a series of doves, “to see if the waters were abated from the face of the earth.” When the ground dries completely God commands Noah to exit the ark and repopulate the earth. Noah builds an altar and offers sacrifices to God. God swears never again to destroy all of mankind because of their deeds.1\nVideo\nGenesis 8 is a straightforward narrative that is largely absent of any significant tension or drama. It provides a bit of a respite between the physical and emotional trauma of the Flood in chapters 6-7 and the familial mischief we will see in chapter 9.\nGenesis 8:1 But God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the livestock that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided.\nGod did not forget about the guy on the barge with the floating zoo.\nIn the Bible, saying “God remembered” is shorthand for “God remembered his promise/covenant.”\nGenesis 19:29 – God remembered Abraham\nGenesis 30:22 – God remembered Rachael, and God listened to her and opened her womb.\nExodus 3:24 - And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.\nExodus 6:5 Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the people of Israel whom the Egyptians hold as slaves, and I have remembered my covenant.\nHere God institutes the evaporative water-cycle.\nThe Hebrew word for wind and spirit are the same: ruach.\nAs wind does not directly cause water to subside, a deeper meaning might be that God sent the Holy Spirit to bring order and institute what we might call the laws of nature upon the newly redesigned planet.\nWe need to remember the context:\nWind and ocean currents would have been entirely new experiences for Noah.\nHe would soon find himself atop a 17,000’ mountain when before, we presume his environment was more tropical. (think altitude sickness and freezing temperatures/ice).\nPerhaps there was lingering seismic activity as the intense weight of water is removed from 1/3 of the earth’s surface.\nI’m sure he was a bit unsettled.\nGenesis 8:2-4 The fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained, and the waters receded from the earth continually. At the end of 150 days, the waters had abated, and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.\nThe 17th day of the seventh month, would be 17th of Nisan.\nPassover is always at sundown on the 14th/15th of Nisan (“between the evenings”)\nIn AD 32, the 17th day of the month would have been a Sunday.\nJesus was crucified on the 14th, in the grave for three days, and resurrected on the 17th. Missler, who supports an AD 32 crucifixion, suggests, “Noah’s ‘new beginning’ on the Plant Earth was on the anniversary – in anticipation – of our ‘new beginning in Christ!”2\nArarat\nWe must note that sometimes the name comes after the tradition and not before.\nThe text says the Ark came to rest in “the mountains of Ararat,” which would indicate that Ararat was a range, not a single peak.\nLater, someone comes along and says, “yeah, it happened right here,” and a tradition is born.\nWe see the same with Mount Moriah in Genesis 22. There is nothing in the text that says Abraham went to Jerusalem; but later tradition places the event there.\nThis is not to say the tradition is wrong; however. We just admit that we aren’t told from the text the precise location.\nModern Mount Ararat (as in a single peak) is in the Lake Van region of eastern Turkey, near the border with Armenia and Iran.3\n17000’ in elevation and is difficult to get to because of the surrounding plains and ridges.\nThis location is attested several times in antiquity, including by Josephus, but the Gilgamesh flood epic has that ark coming to rest in southern Kurdistan.4\nSeveral expeditions have been attempted with some claiming to find fragments of the ark.\nThe Divine Narrator made it a point to tell us that the Ark was pitched on the inside as well as the outside.\nNormally one only need pitch the outside of a wooden boat.\nPitching both sides suggests a need for preservation.\nGenesis 8:5-9 And the waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen. At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made and sent forth a raven. It went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth. Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground. But the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the …","date":1666224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666313328,"objectID":"763a3a9c6210e4d9980d94c78422a71b","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/genesis/gen1/gen08/","publishdate":"2022-10-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/genesis/gen1/gen08/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Genesis 8","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Revelation Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Read/hear the portion Pergamum Background Rev 2:12 To Pergamum Rev 2:13 Praise 2:14-15 But I have this against you Rev 2:16 “Repent!” Pergamum gets no secondary encouragement Rev 2:17: Promise to the Overcomer / Ears Conclusion Church age theory Parables: Pergamum = Mustard Seed (Mat 13:31-32) Paul: Pergamum=Corinthians Read/hear the portion Revelation 2:12-17 “To the angel of the Messianic Community in Pergamum, write: ‘Here is the message from the one who has the sharp double-edged sword: (13) “I know where you are living, there where the Adversary’s throne is.

(14) Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: you have some people who hold to the teaching of Bil`am, who taught Balak to set a trap for the people of Isra’el, so that they would eat food that had been sacrificed to idols and commit sexual sin. (15) Likewise, you too have people who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans. (16) Therefore, turn from these sins. Otherwise, I will come to you very soon and make war against them with the sword of my mouth. (17) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.

Archaeologists believe the city was founded in the third millennium BCE. The town likely owes its beginnings to geography, as there is a conspicuous hill 900 feet above the valley below. It was once thought to be impregnable. Later, Lysimachus, one of Alexander the Great’s four succeeding generals, built a military fortification on this hill called an acropolis. Lysimachus also built Ephesus, and the two cities would vie for power and favor throughout the Roman period. Ultimately Ephesus, with its harbor, became the economic power, while Pergamum became the religious center. Since religion and politics were one and the same, Pergamum became the Roman capital of Asia minor.1 The second photo shows a closer look at the acropolis with labels from Dr. Bolen. Note the theater with seating for 10,000 built into the hill. It is the steepest of all Roman theaters excavated in Turkey.\nThe library was massive by standards of the day with 200,000 volumes, barely second to the library at Alexandria, Egypt. Stiles notes that after relations with the Romans and Egyptians soured and the empire no longer had access to papyrus, Pergamum’s people developed parchment.\nEmperor Worship/Roman Imperial Cult Around 250 BCE, Bolen writes, “Pergamum became a leading cultural center, especially in art and science. The acropolis underwent a massive restoration, and the Aesculapian was founded.”2 Missler writes that Pergamum “became the center of the official religion of emperor worship. The first temple of this cult was erected at Pergamos in 27 BCE.”3 In his commentary, Missler also traces several pagan myths founded in Babylon that eventually were incorporated at Pergamum during the Greek period and eventually to Rome during the Roman period. As was common to all seven cities, numerous pagan statues, shrines, and temples were built in homage to the Roman Imperial Cult. It is also depicted on their coinage.\nAs discussed previously, this put the gentile believers in a difficult position. Emperor worship was compulsory unless you were Jewish. Although not explicitly stated, we can speculate that many in Pergamum went through the motions of the emperor worship procedures (compared to Smyrna, where they did not). Jewish believers and nonbelievers were still in an uncomfortable position, of course. The Torah prohibits graven images, such as the one on this coin and the many statutes erected around the town. Many probably simply got used to it; in other words, they compromised. The genuinely devout would have continued to be bothered by it. As we discussed in the Smyrna lesson, you don’t have to be beaten to feel beaten down. DeSilva notes, “Antagonism towards the Christian movement appears to have been particularly high (in Pergamum), resulting in the murder (whether as a result of official proceedings or back-alley action) of a Christian named Antipas.”4 This was life for the believers in the Roman empire.\nKeener also notes that local rulers were first worshipped and revered in Pergamum, and emperor worship is reflected on coins. “Pergamum was one of the first cities of Asia to build a …","date":1646438400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658953041,"objectID":"56c706a85632a2290eb34064c3a402d5","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/pergamum/","publishdate":"2022-03-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/pergamum/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":["Pergamum"],"title":"Letter to Pergamum","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":" In THE FIRST SIGN, we join Yeshua and His handful of followers in the Jordan River Valley near Jericho.

Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.”\n22 So they said to him, “Who are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”\n31 I myself did not know him, but for this purpose I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel.”\n32 And John bore witness: “I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.\n34 And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.”\nWho were the Ioudaioi? “The translation of Ioudaioi always and only as “Jews” sends the reader in the opposite direction from what the author intended.”1\nWe will develop this in later lessons but John the Gospel Writer, is very loose with his terminology. Ioudaioi, which is the word John uses that is typically translated as “the Jews”, could mean anything from all Jews, to all believing Jews, to those in leadership of the Jewish religious establishment, to those geographically in or from Judea, some other subset2.\nEven if Ioudaioi refers to the religious establishment, John may be indenting for us to understand a specific subset of that. For example, Nicodemus was part of the Ioudaioi religious establishment, but we can be confident he is not part of the Ioudaioi with whom Jesus has any quarrel.\nAs an analogy we could use the term “Americans” The Americans won the gold medal in 1980. All 300 million of us? No. 20 hockey players representing the country. We could also say the Americans bombed Syria. Well that doesn’t all 300 million of us, but maybe a squadron of planes acting on order from one President. We also say today that “the House passed” some piece of legislation; all that could mean is at least 50% of those present+ 1, not all 435 House members acting in unison.\nUnfortunately, many of us have learned to see the “Jews” especially as John uses it has a negative connotation to mean ALL Jews everywhere. The gospel of John has been used to support anti-Semitic behavior in the name of Jesus. This is incorrect and terrible.\nMost of the 1st-century church consisted of Ioudaioi, so it is an error to say that ALL Ioudaioi are guilty of rejecting and killing Jesus. There are believing Ioudaioi and rejecting Ioudaioi. The temple establishment opposed to Jesus and ultimately those who arrested Him and had Him executed could have been a very small number. Perhaps less than 35 and maybe even less than 20: in other words, a very small group of hidden players acting behind the scenes.\nIn any case, we need to make sure some latent anti-Semitic bias is removed from our reading. We need to work to discern the context and which Ioudaioi group John is referencing. If the context is negative, it is probably only the “deep state” fraction of the Temple establishment. This group was primarily Sadducees and Herodians with a small number of Pharisees along for the ride.\nWhen we see the term “Ioudaioi” we will leave it untranslated to remind us that we need to be Bereans and explore the context in which John uses the term.\nGeographic setting John 1:28 tells us that “these things took place in Bethany across the Jordan where John was baptizing.”\nGood scholars dispute the location of “Bethany Beyond the Jordan”\nThe Location of Jesus’ baptism is widely believed to be in the vicinity of Jericho, but this doesn’t mean that John the Baptist didn’t have different …","date":1620691200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672865852,"objectID":"75d4a6597147a186ed3f5e66450dd5d4","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb2/gb08/","publishdate":"2021-05-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb2/gb08/","section":"commentary","summary":"In THE FIRST SIGN, we join Yeshua and His handful of followers in the Jordan River Valley near Jericho.

God also commands Noah regarding the sacredness of life: murder is deemed a capital offense, and while man is permitted to eat the meat of animals, he is forbidden to eat flesh or blood taken from a living animal. Noah plants a vineyard and becomes drunk on its produce. Two of Noah’s sons, Shem and Japheth, are blessed for covering up their father’s nakedness, while his third son, Ham, is punished for taking advantage of his debasement.1\nThose who adhere to dispensational theology see the third of seven dispensations beginning with Genesis 9. At the beginning of creation was the age of “Innocence.” After the fall and through the flood was the age of “Conscience.” After the flood and up until the promise to Abraham is the age of “Human Government.” An example of this is the institution of the death penalty in Genesis 9:5-6.2\nWith this in mind, we’re going to spend the bulk of our time looking at something called the Seven Noachide Laws that the Jewish sages derive from Genesis 9 and how those laws relate to the prohibitions given by the Apostles to the Gentile believers in Acts 15.\nVideo\nVerse-by-verse: Supplement - Noachide Laws and Acts 15:\nTable of Contents Gen 9:1-6 God Commissions Noah Gen 9:7-16 The Rainbow Promise Ancient Covenants Rainbow as a sign of Messiah Gen 9:17-27 Noah’s Drunkenness Gen 9:28-29 Noah Dies at 950 The Seven Noachide Laws of Genesis 9 and the Acts 15 Council Three classes of people Composition of the Acts 15 church Acts 15:12-21 The seven Noachide Laws Gen 9:1-6 God Commissions Noah 1 And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.\nGod reiterates the command given in Eden. In fact, God says “be fruitful and multiply” twice in this passage (v. 1 and v.7).\nWe are going to see that instead of filling the whole earth, humanity is going to gather at Bavel/Babylon3, inviting yet another judgment from God.\n2 The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every bird of the heavens, upon everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea. Into your hand, they are delivered.\nGod recommissions Noah with Dominion; these words echo when God said “it was very good” in Genesis 1\nbirds - Dominion of the Air\nBeasts - Dominion over the Land\nFish - Dominion over the Water\nHebrews 2:7-8 You made him for a little while lower than the angels; you have crowned him with glory and honor, putting everything in subjection under his feet.” Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him.\n3 Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. And as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything.\n1 Timothy 4:1-3 Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons, through the insincerity of liars whose consciences are seared, who forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.\nI hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Peter is not talking about those who say we shouldn’t eat pork and shellfish.\nIn God’s terminology, the flesh of unclean animals is not unclean food. It’s not food at all.\nIn other words, pork and lobster are not foods that God created.\nPaul, who remained an observant jew until the end would not be advocating eating things God said not to eat and that he would not have eaten.\nI tend to think a better modern application would be those who say we need to stop eating beef (something first permitted in Genesis 9:4) and this whole push to eat fake meat that is laced with who knows what chemicals.\n4 But you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.\nActs 15:19-20 Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God but should write to them to abstain from the things polluted by idols, and from sexual immorality, and from what has been strangled, and from blood.\nWalton: “The draining of the blood before eating the meat was a way of returning the life force of the animal to the God who gave it life… (This ceremony) offers recognition that they are partaking of God’s bounty as His guests,…not unlike that of the blessing said before a meal in modern practice.”4\nWe’ll talk much more about Acts 15 in our addendum to this lesson on the Noachide laws.\n5 And for your lifeblood I will require a reckoning: from every beast I will require it and from man. From his fellow man, I will require a reckoning for the life of man. 6 “Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed, for God made man in his own image.\nMatthew 26:52 And behold, one of those who were …","date":1667088000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667489436,"objectID":"a848b99095049e7903f806f381620642","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/genesis/gen1/gen09/","publishdate":"2022-10-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/genesis/gen1/gen09/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Genesis 9 - Human government","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Revelation Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Videos Read/hear the portion Thyatira Background New Testament Thyatira Prelude Rev 2:18 To Thyatira Rev 2:19: Praise/“I know.” Rev 2:20-23: Judgment – Jezebel refuses to repent Rev 2:24-26: Secondary encouragement.

Thyatira was strategically located on a highway connecting it with Pergamum and Troas (and today Istanbul) to the north, Smyrna to the west, and Sardis to the south.\nThyatira is related to θυγάτηρ, thygater, or “daughter.” After Seleucus I (Nicator) took control of the city in 301 BCE, he named the location θυατειροις (Thyateirois) in honor of his daughter.1\nMany devotional (as opposed to scholarly) commentaries reflect that the name means “continual sacrifice,” but only one scholarly reference that I could identify confirmed this, and this author did so without providing any references supporting the Greek interpretation.2 I’m skeptical of this interpretation. It sounds more to me like Protestant commentators contrived these meanings as a dig towards Catholics to support the “Church Age Theory” linking Thyatira to the Catholic/Papal church and the Doctrine of the Mass. Despite differences Protestants may have with Catholic doctrine (and vice-versa), we must be devoted to the truth, not Protestant folklore. I will be glad to post a correction to this paragraph should I come across a hard source supporting one of these alternate names as a potential interpretation of the Koine Greek. Until this time, I would encourage readers to be equally skeptical. “Daughter” appears to be a straightforward Greek interpretation and is entirely consistent with the extra-biblical historical narrative. Remember Acts 17:11, which is our charge to accept the truth and reject falsehoods, no matter how much they may “fit” or how much we may wish they were true.\nWhat does have more scholarly support, though still disputed, is that a former name of the city was “Semiramis,” a mythical goddess common to multiple ancient cultures. Again, in what is likely to be a Protestant misunderstanding (taking a charitable view of it), a book written in 1853 puts forth the suggestion that Semiramis was the mother of Nimrod, the Bible’s first apostate, and they had an incestuous relationship resulting in Tammuz and the Babylonian pagan system which ultimately found their way into the Catholic Church’s practices. There is no historical record supporting the book’s claims, yet to this day, they are passed on as true by many Protestant commentators. So while it was true that Thyatira was likely named Semiramis, the mythical Semiramis’ connection to the Catholic church seems entirely fabricated.\nI can speculate …","date":1646956800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658953041,"objectID":"059b628609794a5e3a3979ee6bd9334d","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/thyatira/","publishdate":"2022-03-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/thyatira/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":["Mt.

Salim is a fertile valley in Samaria east of Shechem.\nVideo Introduction Overview The “First” Passover\nThe “First” overturning of the tables\nNick at Night\nJohn 3:16\nMany scholars believe John is recording separate accounts from the synoptic gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) while others contend John is interweaving the same events and is not necessarily interested in following a strict chronology\nOne problem with treating them each as separate is that we would end up with Jesus celebrating five or six Passovers during the time of his public ministry. You can’t fit more than four Passovers in a 3-year public ministry.\nWith that said, if Jesus drove out the profiteers one year, it’s easy to see they would be right back at it in the future.\nFor reasons we have discussed I tend to believe Luke follows a strict chronology, but whichever view you hold on this I would recommend not holding on to it too tightly.\nInstead, focus on what each gospel writer is trying to communicate\nGeography We ended last lesson with the wedding at Cana (box 4) and Jesus spending a few days in Capernaum. Now, an unknown amout of time has passed and the next major event John records is the “first” Passover in Jerusalem, represented as event #5 according to Schlaegel , who views John’s recount of the temple cleansing as a separate event from the cleansing at Jesus’ final Passover as recorded in the synoptic Gospels. The counter-argument is that John is not as interested in chronology and could be placing the later event here for his own purposes. There are very smart people on both sides of the argument.\nJohn 2:13-17 – The Passover of the Ioudaioi 13 The Passover of the Ioudaioi was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.\nDr. Eli believes John specifies the Passover of the Ioudaioi to differentiate from the Passover of the Shomrim, the Samaritans because John has the Samaritans as one of his intended audiences. The Qumranites also held their own Passover according to their own calendar.\nSamaritans are still around today and continue to celebrate a biblical Passover in much the same way that they have for more than two thousand years.\nBecause the temple in Jerusalem does not exist, Jews do not practice animal sacrifice and thus the closest we can get to the practices of the first century is at the Samaritan celebration each year on Mount Gerizim.’\nTo a Jewish audience, and even to most gentiles, it would not be necessary to specify that it was a Jewish Passover; he could have just said “Passover.”\n14 In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money-changers sitting there.\n15 And making a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and oxen. And he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables.\n16 And he told those who sold the pigeons, “Take these things away; do not make my Father’s house a house of trade.”\n17 His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.”\nArchaeologists have discovered shops built outside the Temple Mount on both the western and southern walls. Jesus presumably had no objection to these. What He took offense with was the commercial activity that had invaded the places intended for worship on the Temple Mount itself. tb020101216 Shops occupied the space underneath the monumental staircase that passed over Robinson’s Arch to provide access to the temple courts.\nAlso that the things the people were selling were necessary for the Passover procedures at the temple and the money changers served an entirely practical purpose. Keener notes that money changers were needed to standardize the various foreign currencies of the pilgrims so the local sellers didn’t have to worry about “exchange rates” if I can use that term.\nWe can surmise that just like today a tourist can get swindled with an unfair exchange rate and a merchant can overcharge the unsuspecting, the same thing must have been happening at the temple. Dishonest money changers and merchants were profiteering at the expense of God’s faithful, likely in collusion with each other. Today that is called racketeering and is very much frowned upon.\nWe talked a little about whether this cleansing is the same as the one the synoptic gospels record at the end of Jesus’ ministry.\nUltimately we recommend to not focus on whether this was the same or different events but focus on what each gospel is teaching us.\nDr. Eli notes that the quote John uses “Zeal for your house will consume me” is different from the quote the synoptic writers use, …","date":1620604800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672865852,"objectID":"32fe32e6162dd4bc2a65a69fee46bfa0","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb2/gb09/","publishdate":"2021-05-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb2/gb09/","section":"commentary","summary":"Table of Contents Video Introduction Overview Geography John 2:13-17 – The Passover of the Ioudaioi Yeshua is IN JERUSALEM, the holy city, for the Passover festival and remains in Judea for a few extra weeks while His disciples immerse new penitents.","tags":["John 2"],"title":"In Jerusalem","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Genesis"],"content":" Table of Contents Introduction Gen 10:1 Noah’s three sons Gen 10:2-5: The Line of Japheth Gen 10:6-20 The Line of Ham Gen 10:8-12 Nimrod and Babylon Gen 10:13-20 Mitzraiym (Egypt) Gen 10:15-18 Canaan and the “ites” Gen 10:19-20: Canaanite Boundaries Gen 10:21-32 Shem – Abraham’s Line Gen 10:21-22 Gen 10:24-25: Arphaxad Gen 10:26-31: Joktan Gen 10:32 Conclusion Gen 11:1-9: The Tower of Babel Love Your Neighbor: Be Interpersonal Bereans Babylon vs. Jerusalem Gen 11:10-26 Shem’s descendants to Abraham Gen 11:27-28 Terah’s line Introduction This will be our final lesson on what we refer to as the “pre-history” section of Genesis. This is a bit of a misnomer as we have plenty of history, but the end of chapter 11 marks a (perhaps THE) major turning point in the book. In chapter 12, the attention shifts to one man, Abraham, and the rest of the Bible will be about Abraham’s descendants and heirs by adoption.\nGenesis 10 and 11 are best read as a single narrative. It’s a genealogy of Noah’s three sons, with specific “interruptions” to let the reader know of noteworthy details.\n10:1 Noah’s genealogy begins.\n10:8-12 – an interruption in the genealogy for details on Nimrod\n10:18-19- an interruption to provide details on the Canaanites\n10:21 – interruption to remind the reader that Shem is the father of Eber, several generations later (Shem, Arphaxad, Salah, Eber)\n10:25 – interruption to tell us the earth was divided in the days of Peleg\n10:30 – interruption to tell us the borders of Joktan\n11:1-9 – interruption to tell us about the Tower of Babel incident\n11:27 – the genealogy of Shem concludes\n11:28-32 – Transition to Abram’s narrative and segue to chapter 12\nGen 10:1 Noah’s three sons These are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood.\nVERY IMPORTANT: As Walton says in his commentary, “there is no attempt (in the text) to link these peoples to racial divisions.”\nVerse five tells us the focus is describing the peoples in terms of language, clan (family groups), and nationality.\nGenesis 10 is called the table of nations (not the table of races); divisions along race are just that, divisions.\nWe know who it is who likes to keep us divided. Satan\nWe are all one race, that of Noah.\nEven to say this is a division among “ethnicities” becomes a problem because as the centuries pass, the ethnic lines become intermingled.\nIn fact, I like the word “clan” as the ESV uses in verse 5. A tribe or nation as used by Native Americans is also a good mental picture.\nThese names aren’t races or ethnicities as much as they are family groups. Today people who appear to be white Europeans can actually be members of the Choctaw or Cherokee nation by virtue of family connections.\nFor another example, my last name is “Flanagan.”\nAlthough this is a distinctively Irish surname, it would be an error to look at my last name and conclude I’m 100% Irish.\nIt would also be an error to look at my last name and assume my nation is Ireland.\nAs people marry and move, things change over time, but the male’s family name (usually) stays the same.\nI could rightfully join the Clan of Flanagan by virtue of my name.\nThe Bible’s focus is on the clans of the Ancient Near East: northern Africa, Syria-Palestine, and Mesopotamia.\nWe take it on faith that the other people groups (east and south Asia, Europe, southern Africa, indigenous peoples of north and south America) came from one of the descendants of Shem, Ham, or Japheth, or perhaps a co-mingling; but, these peoples are not enumerated in the Bible.\nThe Divine Narrator/Author lists 70 names here; this will be later contrasted against the number of Jacob’s family that will enter Egypt in Gen 46.\nSome of these names may be the names of tribes or nations rather than specific individuals – we can’t know for sure. From these and other references (such as the 70 elders in Exodus 24), 70 is said to be symbolic of totality or depending on the context, the totality of the gentile nations (with 12 later becoming the number of Israel).\nIn Hebrew, the word “goyim” means both “nations” and “gentiles”\nAs we go through the Bible, we’ll find that Israel is not one of the nations; Israel is to be set apart from the gentile nations.\nGen 10:2-5: The Line of Japheth The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. The sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. From these the coastland peoples spread in their lands, each with his own language, by their clans, in their nations.\nBased on what we know, the descendants listed of Japheth do not share contiguous land borders but are connected on the basis of being by the sea.1\nVerse 5 “coastland peoples” (ESV), or “maritime peoples” (NIV) As the biblical stage unfolds, we will see the main conflict is primarily going to be between the peoples of Ham and Shem.

Others see the passage as Jesus’ own words, continuing the dialogue with Nicodemus. I would favor these being Jesus’ words, but I can see why people think they might be John’s there are certainly some similarities to passages such as chapter 1, which we know are John’s writings. Ultimately, we would say John is inspired by the Holy Spirit so we can be confident John 3:16 is from the mouth of God, even if not spoken by Jesus to Nicodemus.\nWhat we don’t want to do is view John 3:16-21 as a separate thought.\nHAD to return to Galilee through Samaria. Usually Jews would avoid Samaritans and take the way down the mountain through Jericho then head north along the Jordan. This time, Jesus is going to head due north along the way of the patriarchs, the \u0026lt;click\u0026gt; same road Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob traveled when they needed to go north/south.\nJohn 3:14-16 Jesus is still answering Nicodemus’ question, “how can these things be?”\n“Only Son” recalls Genesis 22 and Abraham’s near offering of Isaac, where Isaac is called Abraham’s “only” (or “unique”) son.\nJohn 3:16 is famous precisely because of the fact it requires no additional insight or commentary to understand.\n“Son of God expresses the true nature of Jesus eternal and essential being. He is the LOGOS made flesh, the Son has emanated forth from God.” That’s a quote from Lancaster’s commentary.\nStern notes that while Matthew presents Jesus as coming for the lost sheep of Israel, John emphasies that Jesus has come to Jews and Gentiles alike.\nGod loves His creation\nHe gives His creation that which is most precious to him.\nJesus is God’s unique son.\nJesus was fully aware that he would have to die.\nEternal suffering is punishment not only for the inevitable consequence of sin, but now, in rejecting God’s provision for that sin.\nFor the individual who trusts in Jesus, eternal life means not only in the future beyond the grave, but positive life now in Jesus – life more abundantly. – from David Stern.\nRemember the Jewish concept of verbs is always tied to action. Belief is not mere intellectual acknowledgment, but a life that reflects a fundamental trust in and reliance on Jesus.\nJohn 3:17-18 There is a debate about whether 3:16-21 is Jesus still speaking to Nicodemus or whether the conversation ends at 3:15, and 16-21 is John’s commentary. Supporters of the later view note the similarity between this passage (verse 18 for example) and John 1 Either way, these words are powerful and for the most part, self-explanatory. Note the tie-in to believing in His name in Chapter 2. The first-coming was not to bring judgment. That is handled the second coming – read the book of Revelation for more information. Remember this thought that he did not come to condemn when we get to the scene at the synagogue at Nazareth. Jesus is going to read from Isaiah 61 but He’s going to omit a line that turns out to be very telling in differentiating between the first and second comings. John (or Jesus) is continuing to contrast light versus dark, innocent vs guilty, saved vs John 3:18 condemned (based on faith, not lineage or works), righteous versus wicked,\nThe Dead Sea scrolls also make these contrasts. This American Colony photograph was taken between 1900 and 1920.\nmat02208\nJohn 3:19 Jesus is now compared to a light coming into the world, which certainly recalls Genesis 1:3-4. As we studied back in the first lesson, there are many parallels with John 1 and Genesis 1.\nIn Jesus’s day, the city would not have been as well-lit after dark. A quick Greek lesson – we often hear that the word “agape” means God’s perfect love. Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives at night (from the east)o o Verse 19 reads, men agapao the darkness…because their deeds are evil. o It’s better to think of Agape as to be totally and completely given over to.\nAre you totally and completely given over to God, or do we give part to God but save part for the world?\n• Note the design:\nThe passage begins with the dark heart (i.e. lies) of man and the meeting with Nicodemus is in the literal darkness.\nThe passage ends with the truth and light of God. o As a literary form, this type of bracketing is common.\nSpiritually, John’s point is the believer passes from death to life; from darkness to light.\nIt’s easy to look at a verse like verse 19 and conclude that is only referring to people who reject God. Well, of course it is, but what we forget is that was you and me at one point. Our sin nature still agapao’s darkness rather than light.\ntb031505530b\nJohn 3:20-21 For those who agapao darkness, the last thing they want is to have their deeds exposed.

(6) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.” \u0026#39; Sardis Background Sardis is about 17 miles south of Thyatira and 60 miles east of Smyrna.1\nThe founding of Sardis likely dates to before the time of Abraham (c 2000 BCE). It was the ancient capital of the Lydian empire. Its patron deity was the Goddess Cybele, which in Greco-Roman times became Artemis/Diana, who was also the patron deity of Ephesus. Cybele’s son was Midas, whom we may know as the one where everything he touched turned to gold. This is a great lesson in the need to think things through. Everything he touched, included things such as food. Before the Greek period, Sardis was rumored to have “gold-bearing sands.”2 Historically, it was an extremely wealthy city all the way through New Testament times.\nThe temple to Diana was the fourth largest Ionic-style temple existing in the ancient world.3 There were eight massive columns on each end with 20 columns on each side. One of these columns is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. For scale, note the people on the ground in the photo.4 At one point, prior to it being excavated by archaeologists, the entire temple was underground, with just the columns sticking up out of the ground.\nLike Pergamum, ancient Sardis sat atop a hill rising 1000 feet from the valley below.5 By appearances, it was impregnable. Geologically, the cliffs were predominately clay, which cracked and eroded. Egotistically, the citizens referred to their city as “Sardis the Impregnable,” so did little to guard.6 One tradition holds that in 549 BCE, Cyrus was approaching with his Persian army. Only one person was designated to watch the one entrance up the cliff and that person fell asleep and dropped his helmet partway down the cliff. The Persians saw the man and the path he took were able to follow that same path to victory. Then in 214 BCE, a nearly identical thing happened. A man was asleep at his post, this time allowing Antiochus I and his Seleucid Greeks to take over. The city was conquered three other times during that period (501, 334, and 322). In the New Testament times, the city was devastated by a severe earthquake in 17 CE. We could say that they had a name that they were impenetrable but were very much vulnerable. Jesus appears to be drawing on this history when He says, “wake up!”\nBurial place of Gog? Eight miles north of Sardis are dozens of these burial mounds (called tumulus) dating from the 8th-6th centuries BCE. This is the mound of Gyges, the first king of Lydia (687-652 BCE), thought by many to be the biblical Gog from Ezekiel 39-397. We will meet Gog again in Revelation 20:8. “and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea.”\nNew Testament Period In contrast to Thyatira, archeologists have been able to uncover many findings at Sardis. Most date from the 2nd century through the Byzantine period. Stiles reports that along a street where 27 shops have been excavated, 10 of these belonged to Christians, clearly indicating integration into mainstream society. This is in remarkable contrast to the previous four cities we have studied, where persecution was expected. The photo shows what archaeologists believe to be a paint shop. The slabs with the crosses inscribed was a water basin.8\nThere is also a large, well-preserved Jewish synagogue that could accommodate 1000 people.

(13) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.” \u0026#39; Philadelphia Background The ancient city of Philadelphia lies under the modern city of Alasehir, Turkey. The abundance of seismic activity tied with the city’s history has created a chaotic situation in relation to excavations. There have been few inscriptions found and almost no significant excavations have been attempted. The remains of the Byzantine Church of St. John the Theologian, built around AD 600, are the most substantial archaeological remains currently visible.1 Massive pillars suggest the 6th-century church was enormous.2 Archaeologists have also found evidence of a stadium, only a part of which is visible today.\nPhiladelphia is about 25-30 miles southeast of Sardis; it had the nickname “Gateway to the East” because of its access to trade routes, including commanding a junction on a Roman Road between Laidocea and Pergamum.34 Through Philadelphia, “Hellenization” spread to the east. Hellenism sought to apply Greek manners and customs, first voluntarily, then forced. Missler sees this Hellenistic “missionary” activity as support for Philadelphia being a type of the missionary church age (1750-present).\nEumenes II, king of Pergamum, had a younger brother Attalus II, who reigned from 159-138 BC. The name means “lover of his brother” and refers to Attalus’s loyalty to his brother in refusing to overthrow him, even amidst encouragement from advisors to do so.5 In the same way, we believe the assembly of brothers and sisters in Philadelphia held fast in their loyalty to Jesus in the face of opposition.\nUnlike Sardis, possibly the oldest city among the seven, Philadelphia is the newest. The city’s growth was impeded by frequent earthquakes, including those in 17 CE that severely damaged Sardis.\nA possible local allusion in the Letter to Philadelphia is that the city’s name was changed twice in the 1st century. At one point, it was named Neo Caesarea after emperor Tiberius, and then to Flavia Philadelphia, after the wife of Vespasian.6 Philadelphia is the name that stuck.\nAll cities of this time would have had enforced pagan worship. Zeus Helios and Anaitis, a person God related to Cybele and later, Artemis, were the patron deities. Temples and coins also featured Zeus, Dionysus, Aphrodite, Asclepius, Cybele, and Nike.7 Wilson states enforcement of the required Roman oath may have been especially strict here.8 Dionysus was an essential deity as grape production was an important industry. See the vineyards in the photo.9 “Many religious festivals were held at the temple to Dionysus.”10 As a biblical type, wine is symbolic of marriage and celebration (cf. the Wedding at Cana), and by extension the Messianic Kingdom, also known as the marriage supper of the Lamb.

Yeshua elects to travel through Samaria, the most direct route to reach Nazareth. We stop at the village of Sychar where Yeshua encounters the Samaritan woman. His disciples return to their homes on the lake, Yeshua take us to Cana. An official from Capernaum travels to Cana to find Yeshua and to implore Him to heal his son.\nVideos Verse-by-verse: Shechem inSITES Samaritans inSITES Introduction John 4 – In Samaria\nBerean Bingo After 10 lessons, a terminology review might be helpful\nTerm Meaning Example Explanation Anachronism Misappropriating concepts in time. “Paul came to cast off Judaism and convert to Christianity.” Gentile Christianity as a distinct religion from Judaism would not begin until the late 1st century and, arguably was not completed until Constantine. Also, a careful reading of Acts indicates that Paul remained a Torah-observant Jew and considered himself a Pharisee. Bicameral Thinking Evaluating two (or more) opposing but seemingly plausible viewpoints and drawing biblical application regardless of which one is factual.\nBicameral thinking forces us to be Bereans and look at a matter from a different perspective. We may even find that one (or both) viewpoints may be invalid and we must come up with a fresh hypothesis.\n\u0026#34;You have had five husbands and the man you have now is not your husband. What you have said is quite correct.\u0026#34; “The woman at the well was steeped in sin and was being snotty and disrespectful. Jesus calls out her sin to set her straight.”\nOr\n“The woman had an extraordinarily hard life with multiple husbands abandoning her despite being well educated in Samaritan religion. Jesus is showing her compassion because He is the God who Sees (El Roi - Genesis 16).”\nEisegesis Reading external presuppositions into the biblical text. “The woman at the well was being snotty and disrespectful.” If our presupposition is that the Gospel writers communicated “Judaism bad, Christianity good,” this viewpoint is going to influence our interpretations, even though a plain reading of the text may not support our conclusions. Exegesis Letting the text speak for itself. “Jesus and the woman were engaged in a sophisticated theological discussion.” The text supports the Samaritan woman was reasonably well educated in matters of Torah, at least as practiced by Samaritans. The text also supports that Jesus is instructing her that Judaism is the more correct way. Macro-narrative Larger themes that emerge above the individual stories \u0026#34;How is that you, a Ioidaiois...\u0026#34; Here, the woman is identifying Jesus as a Jew. Later, Pilate will also identify Jesus as a Jew. This is something the Jewish leadership never does. Thus, one of John\u0026#39;s macro-narratives is authentication. Those who should have authenticated Jesus did not; those who should not have authenticated Him, actually do authenticate Him. Presuppositions Our assumptions we bring with us as we read the text, including those not directly supported by the text. \u0026#34;Sir, you have nothing to draw with.\u0026#34; If we view the woman as snotty and sarcastic, we\u0026#39;re potentially going to view this passage as combative. If we take a view that the woman is a sinner, no better or worse than the rest of us and she\u0026#39;s merely having a discussion with Jesus on par with the one Nicodemus had, we\u0026#39;re going to have a different view of the passage. Geography We’ve done a separate background video on the Samaritans where we briefly touch on the Jewish/Samaritan tensions and explore what lessons this may have for us today.\nJews tended to avoid Samaria and taking the long way around when traveling to/from Jerusalem. This makes the statement that Jesus “had to pass through Samaria” startling.\nIn John’s view, God so loved the world, which even included Samaritans. The path of travel is unusual because this is no ordinary love. Jesus can take us to strange, perhaps hostile and heretical, territory to shine His light of truth if we let Him lead us.\n1\nMt.

Eliezer and Jacob would have followed the same roads.\nTo Shechem This Moody Bible Atlas map3 shows the suggested route (solid green line) through Damascus. Abram possibly acquired the servant Eleazar at this time. Eleazar will be a pivotal supporting character in the story of Abram. As Abram’s eldest servant, he stood to inherit Abram’s estate if Abram had no natural offspring. Eleazar means God’s Helper and in many ways, we will see he is a biblical type of the Holy Spirit, especially in Genesis 24.\nThis Satellite Bible Atlas map4 shows the journey to Shechem, through the center of the country to the Negev, and then eventually to Egypt.\nTo Shechem, then Bethel (Luz) and Ai, then Negev\nWe don’t know exactly how he got to Shechem, but the Wadi Far’a is a good inland road from the Jordan valley.\nGod visits Abram and promises inheritance to Abram’s seed and Abram builds an altar\nHe next moves to an area between Bethel and Ai.\nAi is familiar to those who have studied Joshua as the place where the Israelites were defeated because there was “sin in the camp” – the lesson is that we are all in a community – when one member sins, we all sin and suffer the consequences. We usually think of our faith as individualistic. My business is between God and me; the Bible teaches both individual and corporate/community accountability.\nHe then moved further south to the Negev past Hebron\nTo Egypt\nAbram has gained great wealth but appears to show a lack of faith (we note that it is commonly taught he shows a lack of faith but the text doesn’t say this so we need to be careful with our assumptions).\nEgypt is generally viewed as a type of the world with its enticements and trappings.\nHe places his wife in harm’s way while he accumulates more possessions\nLater we will learn that Abram picked up a concubine named Hagar who would ensnare him with Ishmael as a false substitute for God’s promises\nWe can’t fault Abram for this – he is a picture of us when we try to help God along. This is something the enemy tempts us with every day.\nGod’s promises are unconditional and will be fulfilled despite Abram’s failure.\nGenesis 12:1-5 – God calls Abram to Canaan 1 Now the LORD said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house to the land that I will show you.\n2 And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great so that you will be a blessing.\n3 I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you, all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”\nThis is a spectacular blessing of which you and I are the beneficiaries.\nNote there are seven distinct …","date":1674691200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674762631,"objectID":"2c1d27748ca0217ae5309b064d02243b","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/genesis/gen2/gen12/","publishdate":"2023-01-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/genesis/gen2/gen12/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Genesis 12","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Revelation Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Read/hear the portion Laodicea Background Rev 3:14 Rev 3:15-16 Rev 3:17-18 Rev 3:19 Rev 3:20: Rev 3:21-22: Does it fit?

(22) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.” ’ \u0026#34; Laodicea Background As you can see from the image above, Laodicea, Hierapolis, and Colossae were in very close proximity, and in terms of wealth and power, the cities formed the metroplex of their day. They are at the eastern end of the Meander River valley, with Miletus and Ephesus on the Western end of that valley. Therefore, it was a natural passageway to distribute goods to and from Ephesus. A second valley, the Lycus River valley, ran Northwest to Philadelphia or southeast to Syria. By the second century BCE, Laodicea became the wealthiest and most important of the three because it sat at the junction of these two valleys. The assembly in Laodicea was the furthest south and west of all the churches. After completing his circuit of bringing the letter to each of the seven assemblies (and likely others along the way), the human messenger would have likely returned to Ephesus.\nThe city was founded in the mid-200s BCE by Antiochus II, who named it after his wife, Laodice. Laodice combines the words for “the people” and “justice,”1 or “the people ruling.” 2 This is an interesting name because this is a church where God is on the outside knocking to get in. The Laodiceans were doing what was right in their own eyes. In terms of pronunciation, Greek would have a hard “c” (Lah-od-ik’-i-ah).\nFrom a worldly perspective, the city almost had it all. The photo is from the Sacred Agora, one of the many commerce centers of the city.3 Many of its supposed strengths will be referenced in Revelation.4 According to God, concerning the assembly of believers, they are not strengths at all but weaknesses.\nIt was THE banking center of Asia with large stores of gold (and an adjunct industry of gold refiners) The assembly thinks they are rich, but they are spiritually poor Jesus offers HIS gold Textile manufacturing and distribution, primarily black wool The assembly thinks they are clothed in righteousness, but they are naked Jesus offers HIS covering (white raiment versus black wool) It was a medical center, specifical ophthalmology; Collyrium was an ingredient used in healing eye salves as well as cosmetics The assembly thinks they have clear vision, but they are spiritually blind Jesus, the Great Physician, offers HIS remedy: the Holy Spirit Also, entertainment was everywhere; it had a large stadium and multiple theaters Unlike the actors and athletes who were adorned, the believers were wretched and pitiable As with all cities, everything was dedicated to a false god Though not stated directly, the conclusion, given the previous six letters. is that the Laodiceans comfortably co-mingled paganism with worship of Jesus Metaphorically and probably literally, they were dining at the table with false gods in pagan temples, which are the throne rooms of those gods Jesus invites the believers to dine with Him and Him alone in His throne room and His alone In recent years, archeological work has uncovered many gates, buildings, pillars, inscriptions, and other findings, making it easy to visualize the city\u0026#39;s wealth and prominence. The photo on the left shows a game board from Laodicea.[^5] The photo on the right shows a nearly identical inscription that was found on a stone in Jerusalem in the traditional location of the Stone Pavement.[^6] Some assert that it was the game used by the Roman soldiers when they cast lots for Jesus\u0026#39; clothing right before His crucifixion.

The view from atop the Nazareth hill affords us a splendid view of the Jezreel Valley, Mount Tabor, and the surrounding territory. Take a walk around town and take in the sights as the shops close and people prepare for Sabbath. This is where our Master grew up.\nVideos Part 1: John 4 Part 2: Luke 4 Introduction We continue in John 4, where the woman has left her waterpot at Jesus’ feet as she ran back into town, claiming to have met someone who knows all about her. The disciples returned with food and were curious as to why Jesus was speaking alone with a Samaritan woman, but no one said anything. A talmid’s job is to model and imitate his rav/teacher, so I’m sure the disciples were wondering how far they were supposed to take this “interaction with Samaritans” thing. Jesus will tell them once we get to Luke 10. Everyone is our neighbor, and we’re supposed to love our neighbors.\nAfter this mini discourse on food, Jesus will stay in Samaria for a couple of days and then head back to Nazareth. We’ll pick up the narrative in Luke 4, where He is asked to teach on Shabbat in Nazareth. He proclaims Himself the Messiah, which signals a transition from a private to a public phase of His ministry. The people of Nazareth reject this as blasphemy. He somehow avoids a mob that wants to stone him and relocates to Capernaum to launch his public Galilean ministry. What happens there will fulfill the saying, “A prophet is without honor in his hometown.”\nWe have one more episode in what we categorize as Jesus’ “early ministry.” Next time, we will pick up John 5 in Jerusalem; after this, we’ll return to Capernaum and formally enter the next phase of Jesus’ earthly ministry.\nSchlaegel, in his supplemental study guide for the Satellite Bible Atlas, writes, “Neither war nor diplomacy over hundreds of years was able to break down the barriers between Jews and Samaritans. The Gospel of Jesus Christ did. Many Samaritans in the city believed in him (John 4:39-42).”1\nAlthough we say this period closes Jesus’ private ministry, Jesus had been growing in popularity when He returned to Galilee. Word of His private miracles was spreading and many people reported what Jesus had been doing in Jerusalem.\nWhen an official from Capernaum heard that Jesus had returned to Galilee, he came up to Cana to plead with Jesus to heal his son. With a word, Jesus healed the boy from some 18 miles away. After this, or perhaps immediately before this, Jesus is in Nazareth, where He is rejected.\nJohn 4:31-34 Meanwhile, the disciples urged Him, saying, “Rabbi, eat something.” But He said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.” So the disciples were saying to one another, “No one brought Him anything to eat, did he?” Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to accomplish His work.\nHere we see, perhaps, a paradox. We opened John 4 with Jesus being tired and thirsty – we noted that ministry could be exhausting. While we can get exhausted by the ministry, it can also be incredibly nourishing and fulfilling.\nWe must recall His statement in the wilderness: “Man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.”\nThese photos are from a demonstration of 1st century food preparation techniques.\nOne good suggestion is that when Jesus is on the Father’s mission, He is just as nourished and strengthened as if he had literal food.\nWhen we go on mission trips, we start with the intent to bless others (and hopefully that does happen), but most of us return feeling like we were the ones blessed and spiritually nourished.\nWhen Jesus makes statements like, “do the will of Him who sent me to accomplish His work,” we tend to see this as His work on the Cross.\nThis is correct. Jesus will ultimately accomplish His Father’s work on the Cross – “It is finished” could be translated as “it is fulfilled” or “it is accomplished.” Tetelestai means “paid in full.”\nWe do need to keep the context in mind, however. He has not yet said anything about going to the Cross, so his Talmidim would not have interpreted Jesus’ statement as such.\nIn the near term, the Father’s Work includes Jesus’ teaching, healing, compassion, and breaking down barriers.\nRemember, the talmidim are a picture of us.\nThe Samaritan woman misunderstands His comment about water and she just met him.\nThe talmidim have been with Him for months now, and they are still misunderstanding him.\nPart of the fun of our Christian walk is that we will never have Jesus completely figured out this side of Heaven. Every time we open His word, there is usually a new insight or aspect …","date":1615075200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674865559,"objectID":"ca1e4e815989384885a96d4cddb3c603","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb2/gb12/","publishdate":"2021-03-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb2/gb12/","section":"commentary","summary":"Table of Contents Videos Introduction John 4:31-34 John 4:35-38 John 4:39 John 4:40-42 John 4:43-45 John 4:46-49 John 4:50-54 Luke 4:13-15 Luke 4:16 Luke 4:17-20 Luke 4:21 Luke 4:22-24 Heal Thyself Jesus’ family Luke 4:25-28 Luke 4:29-30 Conclusion In A PROPHET WITHOUT HONOR, we leave the village of Cana and follow Yeshua back to Nazareth to spend a quiet Shabbat in His hometown.","tags":["Matthew 13","Mark 6","Luke 4","John 4"],"title":"12.

This is represented by the blue arrow pointing up to Bethel on the map.1\nIn this region, the Canaanites were the primary inhabitants of the land, yet Abram and Lot both had accumulated large herds that needed food and water.\nThe two camps got into a turf battle, leading Abram to suggest the two separate.\nAbram selflessly elects to defer to Lot, who lifts his eyes towards Sodom and departs. Lot’s movements are represented by the orange arrow and box #3.\nGod honors Abram’s handling of this situation by reaffirming his promise. Abram then moves south to dwell in Hebron.\nGenesis 14 Five kings of Canaan evidently violate a Suzerain-Vassel relationship, which leads to four kings of Mesopotamia moving into the Promised land to make war. We’ll describe what a Suzerain-Vassal treaty is below.\nAs shown on the map,2 the kings move from north to south along the King’s Highway and are victorious over the Rephaim, Zuzim, Emim (two possible locations), and the Horites in the region of Sier.\nAll of this leads up to the main narrative that as the Mesopotamians are plundering the region, they capture Lot with the intention of deporting him.\nAbram is Lot’s kinsman redeemer and thus is obligated to rescue him, which he does way up in the region of Dan (off the map to the north).\nOn his return from rescuing Lot, on his way back to Hebron, Abram meets Melchi-zedek (King of Righteousness) at Salem (Jerusalem).\nGenesis 13:1-4 So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negeb. Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. And he journeyed on from the Negeb as far as Bethel to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, to the place where he had made an altar at the first. And there Abram called upon the name of the LORD.\nAgain, we are reminded that in Genesis 12:1, Abram was supposed to go from his kindred and his father’s house. He certainly had other humans besides his wife with him but the Bible specifically tells us Lot was one of those.\nThe word for “rich” in Hebrew (caveyd, כָּבֵד) literally means to “be weighty.”\nLivestock, silver, and gold weigh quite a bit.\nThere’s also a hint that riches can weigh us down.\nThis would have been around 200 miles but it was a very slow journey; if nothing else the livestock would need time to pasture.\nThis leads to Abram’s next test.\nGenesis 13:5-7: Abram’s and Lot’s men quarrel And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents, so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together, and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land.\nBetween April and October, rain is almost non-existent in most parts of Israel.\nThe Bible also reminds us that the land Abram and Lot were in is not their own. Those wicked Canaanites, whom Noah cursed back in Genesis 9 are the primary residents.\nIt’s not too hard to envision them tripping over each other trying to find the scarce fields and streams for their animals.\nFor the past 4000 years, the main source of contention in the Holy Land is water rights.\nWe often think that more money is the answer, but “will you notice”…\nThe Bible clearly links their large quantity of posessions with the interpersonal strife.\nIf you know what happens to most Lottery jackpot winners, you probably wouldn’t wish that on your worst enemy, let alone wish it would happen to you.\nGenesis 13:8-9: Abram and Lot Separate Then Abram said to Lot, “Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are kinsmen. Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left.”\nAbram passes this mini test\nHis age and status give him the first choice; the natural response would be to assert that right and take the best land for himself.\nAbram shows faith in God by letting Lot go first.\nIn the same way, we should put others first and rely on God to meet our needs.\nLancaster: “Peace between …","date":1674691200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674762631,"objectID":"62d849263eddcc44e0c3533f919732d8","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/genesis/gen2/gen13/","publishdate":"2023-01-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/genesis/gen2/gen13/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Genesis 13 and 14","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Revelation Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Read/hear the portion Revelation Backgrounds’ Focus Rev 4:1-The Heavenly Temple Rev 4:2-In spirit Rev 4:3- Sardius, Jasper, Emerald Rev 4:4-24 Elders Rev 4:5-Thunder Rev 4:6–Sea of Crystal Rev 4:7-Lion, Ox, Man, Eagle Rev 4:8-Holy, Holy, Holy Rev 4:9-He Reigns Rev 4:10-11-He is Worthy Conclusion Read/hear the portion Revelation 4 After these things, I looked; and there before me was a door standing open in heaven; and the voice like a trumpet which I had heard speaking with me before said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after these things.” (2) Instantly I was in the Spirit, and there before me in heaven stood a throne, and on the throne Someone was sitting.

(5) From the throne came forth lightnings, voices and thunderings; and before the throne were seven flaming torches, which are the sevenfold Spirit of God. (6) In front of the throne was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. In the center, around the throne, were four living beings covered with eyes in front and behind. (7) The first living being was like a lion, the second living being was like an ox, the third living being had a face that looked human, and the fourth living being was like a flying eagle. (8) Each of the four living beings had six wings and was covered with eyes inside and out; and day and night they never stop saying, “Holy, holy, holy is Adonai, God of heaven’s armies the One who was, who is and who is coming!” (9) And whenever the living beings give glory, honor and thanks to the One sitting on the throne, to the One who lives forever and ever, (10) the twenty-four elders fall down before the One sitting on the throne, who lives forever and ever, and worship him. They throw their crowns in front of the throne and say, (11) “You are worthy, Adonai Eloheinu, to have glory, honor and power, because you created all things—yes, because of your will they were created and came into being!” Revelation Backgrounds’ Focus We are entering the apocalyptic phase, so there won’t be much geography and probably not many pictures. We’re basically going to track down and read some passages that the original audience likely would have known.\nAs we said at the outset of our study in Revelation, part of the challenge with apocalyptic literature is that the person recording the events is trying to describe the indescribable. Therefore, they are forced to use symbolic language that at times seems other-worldly (because it IS other-worldly; it’s not of this world!). This makes any concrete interpretation difficult.\nAs there are numerous competent commentaries offering various conjectures on what Revelation chapters four and following could mean for 20th and 21st-century believers, we will attempt to limit our study here to identifying and studying the allusions and common themes that appear elsewhere in the Bible. Where possible, we will limit conjectures to those that could have been understood by the original 1st-century audience. In any case, we will attempt to put aside any preconceptions and let the Text speak for itself, even though this may mean quoting an equally cryptic passage from the Old Testament. In the interest of time we won’t be able to unpack everything. Just soak it in and remember Isaiah 55:\nIsa 55:8-11 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the LORD. (9) For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts. (10) “For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return there but water the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater, (11) so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.\nVerse 11 means that any time we can spend studying God’s word is productive and profitable time.\nRevelation 4 Cross-reference Verses PDF\nRev 4:1-The Heavenly Temple After these things, I looked; and there before me was a door standing open in heaven; and the voice like a trumpet which I had heard speaking with me before said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after these things.\u0026#34;\nMeta Tauta “after these things” This serves as a transition from the previous vision of the seven assemblies to this vision in the heavenly throne room. A roughly equivalent phrase in the Hebrew Bible is “I looked, and behold.”.

John’s Courtroom Narrative John 5:36 John 5:37-40 John 5:41-43 John 5:44-47 Retro Video In the POOLS OF BETHESDA, we follow Yeshua as He makes another pilgrimage to Jerusalem to keep one of the festivals. On the Sabbath day, we head for the Temple. On the way there, we walk along the city walls and cut through the five-colonnaded double pool of Bethesda on our way to the Sheep Gate. Then we duck inside and up to the Temple to spend the rest of the day, where a delegation from the religious leaders in Judea reprimands Him for healing on the Sabbath. The ensuing discourse occurs within the Temple courts, but the discussion takes us from the carpenter shop in Nazareth to the end of the era, the resurrection of the dead, the Messianic Kingdom, and the final judgment.\nContents What was the unnamed feast of the Ioudaioi?\nWhat happened to verse 3b and 4?\nWhere and, more importantly, WHAT were these pools?\nWhy were the Ioudaioi upset?\nWho were the THREE witnesses testifying on behalf of Jesus?\nGeography Schlaegel’s introduction: “Jesus interrupted His ministry in Galilee (Map 11-5) when He came to Jerusalem for an unnamed festival. On a Sabbath at the Pools of Bethesda, Jesus healed a man who had been lame for 38 years. After nearly two thousand years of searching for these pools, they were finally excavated beginning in the 1960s.\nThey are located just north of the temple mount, near the remains of the Antonio fortress.\nWe now know that these pools were not associated with the Jewish temple whatsoever but with the Greco-Roman God of healing, Asclepius. So, we have a man, whom we later find out is Jewish, had ineffectually waited for years on a superstitious healing.\nBecause of this discovery, we can confidently say that the description in some Greek manuscripts in John 5:3b-4 of an angel of the Lord stirring the waters is an incorrect 4th century AD addition.\nBox E marks the pools of Bethesda.\nAn important geographic clue could like in the fact that although the pools today are inside the city walls, at the time of Jesus, they were outside the city walls. On this map, we can see that Gogaltha was also outside the walls. Despite the pool’s proximity to the Temple, we believe from archeology that these pools were actually pagan. The Greeks and Romans had pagan healing centers called Asclepions throughout the empire. The larges one was in the city of Pergamom, one of the seven churches of Revelation. You might want to check out the background video on Pergamom: https://youtu.be/NcftNgsIHWw?t=569\nAsclepius with Serpent\nUnderstanding that these pools are pagan and not Jewish changes the entire complexity of the passage, which we will get into as the study unfolds.\nAfter the miracle, Jesus claimed to not only have the power to heal but to raise the dead.” In other words, Jesus is “greater than the healing sanctuaries of His day.” He is also greater than our medical system today.\nTransition Much like our previous lesson at the Nazareth synagogue represented a transition from private to public in Jesus’ Galilean ministry, this lesson represents a transition from private to public in His Judean ministry.\nPerhaps, John, in reading the available manuscripts from the synoptic writers noticed a lack of detail on Jesus’ activities in Jerusalem prior to Passion week. In any case, John pays significantly more attention to Jesus’ activities in Judea than do Matthew, Mark, and Luke.\nAs we move into more public encounters, we should begin to be like stage directors.\nNotice the setting; where is He? Remote countryside? Galilean village? The big city of Jerusalem or its “suburbs”?\nAre people seeking out Jesus or is He targeting someone for a specific interaction?\nWho is present, and who is not present? To be specific we need to say who is “documented as being present.”\nNote whom Jesus interacts directly versus onlookers;\nNote who might be favorably disposed to Jesus’ message, who might be hostile and who might be on the fence.\nIn this case, note who is not mentioned. The disciples. Jesus went to the feast alone, or at least John did not mention the presence of any other friendlies accompanying Jesus to the feast.\nJohn 5:1 – An unnamed Feast After these things, there was a feast of the Ioudaioi, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.\nJohn likes this phrase meta touta, after these things.\nIt’s peculiar that this is an unnamed feast of the Ioudaioi.\nPerhaps omitting the name of the feast is another clue that the location of the miracle is in no way connected with Judaism.\nWhen we get to John 9 and that healing, the Pool of Siloam WAS connected with the Temple and WAS inside the city walls at the time. It is outside the walls today. The entire complexion of John 9 is …","date":1615680000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676237963,"objectID":"9bb7def3f36817587f6ec2b7e98dd2fc","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb2/gb13/","publishdate":"2021-03-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb2/gb13/","section":"commentary","summary":"Table of Contents Contents Geography Transition John 5:1 – An unnamed Feast John 5:2-3a John 5:5 John 5:6-9 John 5:10-13 John 5:14-16 The Authority of the Son is the Same as the Father’s John 5:17-18 John 5:19-30 Chaism John 5:19-24 John 5:25-30 Walking in His dust John 5:31-35.","tags":["John 5"],"title":"13.

(4) I cried and cried, because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look inside it. (5) One of the elders said to me, “Don’t cry. Look, the Lion of the tribe of Y’hudah, the Root of David, has won the right to open the scroll and its seven seals.” (6) Then I saw standing there with the throne and the four living beings, in the circle of the elders, a Lamb that appeared to have been slaughtered. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the sevenfold Spirit of God sent out into all the earth. (7) He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of the One sitting on the throne. (8) When he took the scroll, the four living beings and the twenty-four elders fell down in front of the Lamb. Each one held a harp and gold bowls filled with pieces of incense, which are the prayers of God’s people; (9) and they sang a new song, “You are worthy to take the scroll and break its seals; because you were slaughtered; at the cost of blood you ransomed for God persons from every tribe, language, people and nation. (10) You made them into a kingdom for God to rule, cohanim to serve him; and they will rule over the earth.” (11) Then I looked, and I heard the sound of a vast number of angels—thousands and thousands, millions and millions! They were all around the throne, the living beings and the elders; (12) and they shouted out, “Worthy is the slaughtered Lamb to receive power, riches, wisdom, strength, honor, glory and praise!” (13) And I heard every creature in heaven, on earth, under the earth and on the sea—yes, everything in them—saying, “To the One sitting on the throne and to the Lamb belong praise, honor, glory and power forever and ever!” (14) The four living beings said, “Amen!” and the elders fell down and worshipped. Rev 5:1 Next I saw in the right hand of the One sitting on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals; A seal would have been made of clay (later, wax) with an imprint of authentication During the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem, many documents were destroyed, leaving only the clay seals. Hundreds of these seals have been found all over Israel They are called LMLK (l’melech – to the king) Sometimes they would be tied with a string, with the clay or wax molded around the string – to get to the string, one would need to break the seal Seals still intact let the bearer know that the contents were not altered In other words, not added or deleted Rev 22:18-19 I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, (19) and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book. This scene resembles when the Torah was given to Moses Exo 32:15-16 Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets that were written on both sides; on the front and on the back they were written. (16) The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets. This is also descriptive of legal documents of the ancient world. Keener notes that many such documents had seven seals, which guaranteed no one had open or tampered with them. Consider this passage from Jeremiah: Jer 32:9-15 “And I bought the field at Anathoth from Hanamel my cousin, and weighed out the money to him, seventeen shekels of silver. (10) I signed the deed, sealed it, got witnesses, and weighed the money on scales. (11) Then I took the sealed deed of purchase, containing the terms and conditions and the open copy. (12) And I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my cousin, in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, and in the presence of all the Judeans who were sitting in the court of the guard. (13) I charged Baruch in their presence, saying, (14) ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, both this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware vessel, that they may last for a long time. (15) For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.’ The writing on the outside likely provided the terms and conditions for breaking the seals.

Genesis 15:15-16 Genesis 15:17 – The Torch is Messiah Genesis 15:18-21 Genesis 15 – A faith completed by works (James 2:22) Geographic setting\nWe aren’t provided a specific location for the events in this chapter. Verse 15 references Abraham buried, which we know is Hebron, SW of Jerusalem and Bethlehem.\nFaith Alone? Genesis 15 is an important chapter to the Apostolic Writers. Verse 6 contains the famous statement, “He (Abraham) believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.”\nThis verse is directly referenced in Romans 4, Galatians 3, Hebrews 11, and James 2. This verse, along with Habakkuk 2:4, “The just shall live by faith,” are the verses that sparked the Reformation.\nPaul spends an entire chapter, Romans 4, developing Abraham’s faith, and, as a compliment, James spends half of chapter two doing the same, but in a slightly different context. The famous “faith without works is dead” passage uses Abraham in Genesis 15 as a backdrop. So we’re going to need to be Bereans (Acts 17;11) and do our homework to piece all of this together to make sure we have a firm grasp of how faith and works go together. This is important because, in my humble opinion, the protestant church has largely gotten it wrong for the past 500 years by teaching “Faith Alone.” That’s not exactly what the Bible teaches. Jesus never says our works don’t matter; in fact, there are multiple passages where He essentially says, “if you love me, you will keep my commands.” (John 14:15, 14:24, 15:10, Mat 28:20, etc.). But as always, don’t believe what I say. Be a Berean and check it out for yourself.\nWhat is true is the order. Faith comes first, then obedience. We’ll see Abraham’s faith here in Chapter 15, and then we’ll see his obedience, culminating with obedience beyond all understanding in Genesis 22. God delivered the Israelites from Egypt first, then gave them the Torah, the standards of ethical behavior for His people. Jesus first says come to Me you who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest” (Mat 11:28), then he says, “(teach) them to obey all I have commanded” (Mat 28:20).\nIt would be worth our time to read Romans 4 and James 2:14-26 in conjunction with Genesis 15.\nAll told, Abraham occurs 75 times in the New Testament, and the events in His life that are referenced the most begin in this chapter. A firm understanding of Chapters 15, 16, 17, 21, and 22 will significantly aid our correct interpretation and application of New Testament teaching.\nGenesis 15:1-3 After these things, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: “Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.” But Abram said, “O Lord GOD, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?” And Abram said, “Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir.”\nGod communicates in visions. They are distinct from dreams in that the recipient has no doubt the conversation really took place.\nAs we remember, the chapter and verse breaks are man’s insertions; they are not divinely inspired.\nWe are used to “after these things” denoting a scene shift, but this is not to say the events after these things are not related to the events before “these things.”\nIf we read the Story of Abraham as a continuous narrative, Abraham has just given 10% to Melchizedek and did not keep any spoils for himself.\nGod viewed this with favor and here says, “because you refused reward from the King of Sodom, your reward from Me will be very great.”\nAbraham wants to know what has become of the promises of Chapter 12.\nIf a man had no son, he could legally adopt a servant.\nDespite God’s earlier promise, Abraham seems resigned to this course of action, possibly believing that Eliezer is whom God had in mind to continue Abraham’s line all along.\nIn hindsight, since we know what is about to happen with Isaac, it’s easy for us to see a lack of faith, especially since God specifically said, “your offspring.” We, as disciples, often limit God to what we can see.\nHow patient and faithful would WE be if we were in Abraham’s shoes?\nEliezer means “God is Help” or “God’s helper.”\nFour times in John 15, Jesus refers to the Holy Spirit as “the Helper.”\nJohn 15:26 “But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me. Remember this discussion when we get to Genesis 24 when the father’s (unnamed) helper goes to fetch a bride for the son.\nGenesis 15:4-5 And behold, the word of the LORD came to him: “This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir.” And he brought him outside and said, “Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them.” Then he said …","date":1674691200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674762631,"objectID":"6ad4971deb806812b425671c5337e63d","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/genesis/gen2/gen15/","publishdate":"2023-01-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/genesis/gen2/gen15/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Genesis 15","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Revelation Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Four Horseman of the Apocalypse Rev 6:1 First Seal Rev 6:2 White Rev 6:3-4 Red Rev 6:5-6 Famine Rev 6:7-8 Pale The 5th Seal: Martyrs Rev 6:9 Rev 6:10 Rev 6:11 Timing questions The Sixth seal Rev 6:12-14 Rev 6:15-17 Closing Thoughts Six followed by a rest Matthew 24, Luke 21, and Revelation 6 Similarity to the Plagues of Egypt References Video\nRead/hear the portions:\nRev 6:1-17 Next, I watched as the Lamb broke the first of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living beings say in a thundering voice, “Go!” (2) I looked, and there in front of me was a white horse; its rider had a bow and was given a crown, and he rode off as a conqueror to conquer. (3) When he broke the second seal, I heard the second living being say, “Go!” (4) Another horse went out, a red one; and its rider was given the power to take peace away from the earth and make people slaughter each other. He was given a great sword. (5) When he broke the third seal, I heard the third living being say, “Go!” I looked, and there in front of me was a black horse, and its rider held in his hand a pair of scales. (6) Then I heard what sounded like a voice from among the four living beings say, “Two pounds of wheat for a day’s wages! Six pounds of barley for the same price! But don’t damage the oil or the wine!” (7) When he broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living being say, “Go!” (8) I looked, and there in front of me was a pallid, sickly-looking horse. Its rider’s name was Death, and Sh’ol followed behind him. They were given authority to kill one-quarter of the world by war, by famine, by plagues and with the wild animals of the earth. (9) When the Lamb broke the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been put to death for proclaiming the Word of God, that is, for bearing witness. (10) They cried out in a loud voice, “Sovereign Ruler, HaKadosh, the True One, how long will it be before you judge the people living on earth and avenge our blood?” (11) Each of them was given a white robe; and they were told to wait a little longer, until the full number of their fellow-servants should be reached, of their brothers who would be killed, just as they had been. (12) Then I watched as he broke the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake, the sun turned black as sackcloth worn in mourning, and the full moon became blood-red. (13) The stars fell from heaven to earth just as a fig tree drops its figs when shaken by a strong wind. (14) The sky receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place. (15) Then the earth’s kings, the rulers, the generals, the rich and the mighty—indeed, everyone, slave and free—hid himself in caves and among the rocks in the mountains, (16) and said to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us, and hide us from the face of the One sitting on the throne and from the fury of the Lamb! (17) For the Great Day of their fury has come, and who can stand?”\nFour Horseman of the Apocalypse The beginning of the woes that will unfold throughout the rest of the book Talmud discusses a seven-year period of calamity followed by the establishment of the Messianic kingdom. There is a general expectation that before the coming of the Messiah, there will be a period of tribulation leading up to the final redemption. Revelation has echoes of Exodus and the plagues on Egypt, with the deliverance of God’s people through the plagues. Horsemen imagery appears twice in Zechariah Zec 1:8-11 “I saw in the night, and behold, a man riding on a red horse! He was standing among the myrtle trees in the glen, and behind him were red sorrel, and white horses. (9) Then I said, ‘What are these, my lord?’ The angel who talked with me said to me, ‘I will show you what they are.’ (10) So the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, ‘These are they whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.’ (11) And they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees, and said, ‘We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth remains at rest.’ Zec 6:1-8 Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains. And the mountains were mountains of bronze. (2) The first chariot had red horses, the second black horses, (3) the third white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses—all of them strong. (4) Then I answered and said to the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” (5) And the angel answered and said to me, “These are going out to the four winds of heaven (cf. Rev 7:1), after presenting themselves before the Lord of all the earth.

As we work through, ask yourself what would you have done if you were Abraham and why?\nAlso, while an in-depth study of the various issues Paul addresses in Galatians is beyond our scope, Paul will use Hagar versus Sarah and Ishmael vs Isaac as typological models. The greater our understanding of Genesis chapters 16-21, the better we will be able to follow Paul’s rather complex arguments.\nGeography Schlaegel, author of the Satellite Bible Atlas writes, “Despite the promises made in chapter 15, in chapter 16, we see what can happen when we get impatient with God. Abram went into Hagar and she became pregnant. This lead to strife between Sarai and Hagar and Hagar decides to flee. God tells her that Ishmael will be blessed (though he will be a “wild ass of a man”) and she should return. We aren’t told exactly where this happens but it is along the “Way of Shur””12\nGenesis 16:1-2 Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. She had a female Egyptian servant whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said to Abram, “Behold now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Go in to my servant; it may be that I shall obtain children by her.” And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.\nA maidservant was a legal extension of her owner, so legally and technically, the result of the procedure Sarai suggested would have counted as Sarai’s offspring.\nIn Sarai’s defense, she probably felt like the one who was responsible for the unfulfilled promise and she was well past child-bearing age.\nGoing in to someone who is not your wife sounds odd to us but Sarai’s logic is no different than adoption, where two surrogate parents were involved with the conception or artificial insemination where one surrogate parent is involved.\nIt was a way to build a family with natural methods fail.\nHowever, Sarai showed a lack of faith – it is God’s prerogative to open closed wombs.\nAlthough this method was a reasonable option in that day, In Abrahams’s case it is different because he was given a specific promise by God.\nLike many poor choices, this one “seemed like a good idea at the time.”\nWhose voice SHOULD Abraham have been listening to?\nWhenever we doubt God and act in the flesh, we “sire an Ishmael.” How many of us have a lot of little Ishmaels running around?\nThis was a socially acceptable arrangement in the Ancient world, but I’m reminded of the phrase, “just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.”\nMore specifically, God calls us to a higher standard than the society around us.\nThis is the 5th major test, according to Maimonides, a traditional Jewish commentator.\nSpecifically, the test was the long wait for the birth of a promised son, not being presented with Hagar (but we can see how impatience results in more tests, and often more opportunities to fail those tests).\n“I want a child, and now look. My wife gives me option B.”\nAfter doing really well in chapters 13-15, Abraham blows it on multiple levels here.\nWe wish we could have a solid trend of growth, like a chart that consistently goes “up and to the right,”\nOur lives resemble a stock chart more than a trend line.\nUp and down; a good quarter, followed by a not-so-good quarter, and so forth.\nI can’t help seeing some parallels between Sarai and Eve\nThe text doesn’t say that Satan prompted Sarai, but it is safe to say the decision was not from God, and at least in an indirect sense, her decision was from the enemy.\nGod spoke through Adam and Abraham.\nSatan spoke through Eve and Sarai (if only indirectly)\nAdam listened to Eve, when He knew what God has said about the Tree.\nAbraham listened to Sarai when he knew what God had said about offspring\nIn the last two chapters, the Divine Narrator wants us to know the geographic origin of the two servants.\nIt seems that wherever Abraham goes, he accumulates more people.\nIn Haran, it was Lot; in Damascus, it was Eliezer; and in Egypt, it was Hagar.\nHe wasn’t supposed to be in Haran\nHe was told to leave his father’s country and his family and head to a place God showed him.\nLot was a repeated source of grief for Abram.\nHe was in Damascus because he was doing a righteous deed.\nHe was Lot’s kinsman redeemer and went after a lost sheep just like our Kinsman Redeemer pursued us.\nEliezer of Damascus was a source of blessing for Abraham, which we will see in Genesis 24.\nHe was not supposed to be in Egypt.\nGod showed him Canaan, not Egypt; going to Egypt demonstrated a lack of faith in God’s promises.\nHe accumulated Hagar, who will be a source of grief.\nHagar’s offspring and Sarah’s offspring have been clashing ever since.\nWalking in His Dust #1 Talmidim demonstrate patience and …","date":1674691200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674762631,"objectID":"9bb0451c8e8ad2d63f50eec89d245ac6","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/genesis/gen2/gen16/","publishdate":"2023-01-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/genesis/gen2/gen16/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Genesis 16","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Revelation Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Rev 7:1 Rev 7:2-3 Rev 7:4-8 Rev 7:9 Rev 7:10-12 Rev 7:13 Rev 7:15-17 Pause to Review Watch the video\nRevelation 7 Cross-reference Verses PDF\nRead The Passage\nRev 7:1-17\nAfter this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the land, on the sea or on any tree. I saw another angel coming up from the east with a seal from the living God, and he shouted to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea, “Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads!” I heard how many were sealed—144,000 from every tribe of the people of Isra’el: From the tribe of Y’hudah 12,000 were sealed, from the tribe of Re’uven 12,000, from the tribe of Gad 12,000, from the tribe of Asher 12,000, from the tribe of Naftali 12,000, from the tribe of M’nasheh 12,000, from the tribe of Shim`on 12,000, from the tribe of Levi 12,000, from the tribe of Yissakhar 12,000, from the tribe of Z’vulun 12,000, from the tribe of Yosef 12,000, from the tribe of Binyamin 12,000. After this, I looked; and there before me was a huge crowd, too large for anyone to count, from every nation, tribe, people and language. They were standing in front of the throne and in front of the Lamb, dressed in white robes and holding palm branches in their hands; and they shouted, “Victory to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!” All the angels stood around the throne, the elders and the four living beings; they fell face down before the throne and worshipped God, saying, “Amen! “Praise and glory, wisdom and thanks, honor and power and strength belong to our God forever and ever! “Amen!” One of the elders asked me, “These people dressed in white robes—who are they, and where are they from?” “Sir,” I answered, “you know.” Then he told me, “These are the people who have come out of the Great Persecution. They have washed their robes and made them white with the blood of the Lamb. That is why they are before God’s throne. “Day and night they serve him in his Temple; and the One who sits on the throne will put his Sh’khinah upon them. “They will never again be hungry, they will never again be thirsty, the sun will not beat down on them, nor will any burning heat. “For the Lamb at the center of the throne will shepherd them, will lead them to springs of living water, and God will wipe every tear from their eyes.” Rev 7:1 After this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the land, on the sea or on any tree.\n“After this,” could mean that this vision came after the previous one; not necessarily that the events in chapter 7 necessarily follow those in Chapter 6. Keener sees 6:12-17 as representing the end of the age, so chapter 7 with the sealing of the faithful must occur beforehand.1 The seven seals/trumpets/bowls could be different visions describing the same things; not necessarily 21 different events in sequence. Four corners is clearly symbolic – no one in that day believed the earth was square. Here it represents the four directions on the compass. The four winds/horsemen/angels are apparently connected: Zec 6:1-8 Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains. And the mountains were mountains of bronze. (2) The first chariot had red horses, the second black horses, (3) the third white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses—all of them strong. (4) Then I answered and said to the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” (5**) And the angel answered and said to me, “These are going out to the four winds of heaven, after presenting themselves before the Lord of all the ear**th. (6) The chariot with the black horses goes toward the north country, the white ones go after them, and the dappled ones go toward the south country.” (7) When the strong horses came out, they were impatient to go and patrol the earth. And he said, “Go, patrol the earth.” So they patrolled the earth. Rev 7:2-3 I saw another angel coming up from the east with a seal from the living God, and he shouted to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea, “Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads!\u0026#34;\nThis seal is God’s signet ring; i.e., His stamp of authentication From Rev 14:1, we know that the seal was the name of the Lamb and of his Father. Rev 14:1 Then I looked, and behold, on Mount Zion stood the Lamb, and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads. This is a challnge to interpret since we believe there are more than 144,000 servants of God. See discussion at Rev 7:4-8.

Therefore Beer Sheba is a good guess.\nIn Genesis 17, God reaffirms His promise to Abraham, whose name God has recently changed. Abraham means “father of multitudes,” which at this point has to be considered a prophecy. As a sign of the covenant, God institutes circumcision. Sarai’s name is changed to Sarah, meaning “Princess.” God reiterates that Sarah will have a child in her old age. Abraham laughs, and God says the son’s name shall be Laughter “Yitzhak.” Abraham then circumcises himself, his son Ishmael, and the rest of his household (who probably weren’t laughing).\nGenesis 17:1-2: Abraham is 99 when LORD appears again 1 Now when Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, “I am God Almighty; Walk before Me, and be blameless. “I will make My covenant between Me and you, And I will multiply you exceedingly” (New American Standard Version).1\nThe first mention of God Almighty = El Shaddai\nUsed 48x in OT\nWe aren’t exactly sure what “shaddai” means, but it has the sense of supplier, strength, protector, guardian, and sufficiency.\nMezuzot and tefillin (phylacteries) have the Hebrew שׁ for Shaddai.\nLancaster: “He is sufficient to meet our needs. He is sufficient to carry us and sustain us, even through the long, dry spells when we do not necessarily feel His presence.”2\nThirteen years have passed between Genesis 16 and 17 and twenty-four years since Genesis 12.\nUndoubtedly, Abraham assumed Ishmael was the promised son.\nLancaster sees a separate covenant from Genesis 15, one that “reaffirms all the same promises but increases their scope.”\nMost other commentators would agree that the scope is increased but it’s the same covenant.\nLancaster sees the following distinctions:\nGen 15 Gen 17 Unconditional, Abram was asleep Abraham must live out his life with integrity and walk with God, submitting to His Authority. A great nation A multitude of nations (4) Abundant seed Kings come forth (6) Land is a possession. Canaan is an everlasting possession (8) Name and mother of son not stated – Abraham assumed Ishmael Sarah will have a son to be named Isaac (16, 20-21) This may be hyperanalyzing the two covenants, but it’s interesting (I have three of his commentaries, and he only mentioned this in the oldest one; it’s entirely possible he’s since backed off of this viewpoint).\nWhat does it mean to walk before God and be blameless?\nLancaster writes, “Messianic Paul Leavertoff said, “If you want to know God, you must first have the certainty that He knows and loves you.” That’s the basis for a friendship, such as Abraham experienced with God.”3\nGenesis 17:3-4: Father of multitudes Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying, “As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, And you will be the father of a multitude of nations.\nA minor point perhaps, but it doesn’t say “our covenant” it says “My covenant.”\nLancaster’s view notwithstanding, it could be God is reiterating that the covenant is unilateral.\nPerhaps this is in response to chapter 16, where we might say Abraham tried to meet the terms of God’s covenant in Abraham’s own power apart from God.\nWalton notes “no parallels in the ancient world to covenants between diety and mortal. Gods make demands and promise favor…but these fall far short of a covenant relationship initiated by diety for His own purposes.”4\nGenesis 17:5-6: Abram to Abraham “No longer shall you be named Abram, But your name shall be Abraham; For I have made you the father of a multitude of nations. “I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you.\nAbraham = father of multitudes. For a moment this must have seemed like a cruel joke. He was 99. Imagine the snickering when he told his men his new name.\nAs a matter of fact, the King of Kings will come from Abraham.\nMatthew 1:1: The record of the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham:\nAs we mentioned, Romans 4 is Paul’s exposition on Genesis 15:6, “Abraham believed and it was credited to him as righteousness.”\nPaul makes a reference to Genesis 17:5\nRomans 4:17-18 (as it is written: “I HAVE MADE YOU A FATHER OF MANY NATIONS”) in the presence of Him whom he believed, that is, God, who gives life to the dead and calls into being things that do not exist.

Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. And another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer, and he was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne, and the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before God from the hand of the angel. Then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth, and there were peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake. Now the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to blow them. The first angel blew his trumpet, and there followed hail and fire, mixed with blood, and these were thrown upon the earth. And a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up. The second angel blew his trumpet, and something like a great mountain, burning with fire, was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood. A third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed. The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, blazing like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many people died from the water, because it had been made bitter. The fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of their light might be darkened, and a third of the day might be kept from shining, and likewise a third of the night. Then I looked, and I heard an eagle crying with a loud voice as it flew directly overhead, “Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, at the blasts of the other trumpets that the three angels are about to blow!”\nVideo\nIntroduction We are waiting on the opening of all seven seals to open the document of reception Seals 1-4 were the four horsemen, with their associated calamities Seal #5 were the martyrs crying out to God for justice. They were told to wait a little longer. Seal #6 unleashes the Day of the Lord with earthquake, sun going to black, the sky being rolled up, with the earth-dwellers crying out for refuge from God’s wrath. Most scholars see all six seals as yet future, but an argument may be made that the first 5 could have been opened in the first century, while the sixth is still to come. In other words, the first 5 represent birth pangs that increase in intensity as the time of delivery nears. In Matthew 24, Jesus says when we see the same types of things as in the first five seals, the end is “not yet.” Rev 8:1 When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.\nSilence God paused to hear the silent prayers of the saints, corresponding to the time of daily prayers/sacrifices at the temple The priest in charge of the incense would be inside the temple while the people outside were praying. Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist was that incense priest Luk 1:21 And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in the temple. In the absence of a temple, the congregants pray in silence, as they do today in the synagogue in the Amidah prayer. Dan 6:10 When Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he went to his house where he had windows in his upper chamber open toward Jerusalem. He got down on his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously. Jerusalem was in rubble, yet Daniel still faced Jerusalem when He prayed. An alternate conjecture is that God paused to hear the defense of Earth-dwellers who feel the sixth seal was unwarranted/unfair. Lo and behold, they have nothing to say. *If the seven trumpets are not sequential but are more of a retelling of events that happened during the seven seals, the pause could be the end of the earth age (the sixth seal), and the beginning of the Messianic age (aka, what we call the “age to come”) The Messianic Age is often seen as a type of “sabbath rest” In fact, the ancient sages said there would be 6000 years of man fruitless toil, followed by 1000 years of Messiah’s sabbath peace Rev 8:2 Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. Seven angels – Judaic tradition during the first century held seven archangels serving on God’s council: Gabriel, Michael, Raphael, Uriel, Saraquel, Raguel, and Remiel (with the first two mentioned directly in the Bible, and the first four being, in a sense, preeminent over the other three Trumpets Called army to war, worshippers to the temple, and told the tribes in the …","date":1651881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658354633,"objectID":"45b4e876354f4f3e480ad8a2b2e087d8","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/rev08/","publishdate":"2022-05-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/rev08/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Trumpet Judgments - Revelation 8","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Video Introduction Video Introduction Written commentary coming soon.\n","date":1619913600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661983304,"objectID":"d0ee7541450df9fb3df0b6e7d1b94177","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb3/sermon-mount-iii/","publishdate":"2021-05-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb3/sermon-mount-iii/","section":"commentary","summary":"Table of Contents Video Introduction Video Introduction Written commentary coming soon.","tags":["Matthew 6","Luke 6","Luke 11","Luke 12"],"title":"Sermon on the Mount III ✧ Gospel Backgrounds","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Video Introduction Video Introduction Written commentary coming soon.\n","date":1620518400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661983304,"objectID":"5bc2ecb2261b5e0dee7519770020e438","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb3/17b-sermon-mount-iv/","publishdate":"2021-05-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb3/17b-sermon-mount-iv/","section":"commentary","summary":"Table of Contents Video Introduction Video Introduction Written commentary coming soon.","tags":["Matthew 7"],"title":"Sermon on the Mount Iv ✧ Gospel Backgrounds","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Genesis"],"content":" Table of Contents Genesis 18:1-2 Genesis 18:3-5 Walking in His Dust Genesis 18:6-8 Genesis 18:9-12 Genesis 18:13-16 Genesis 18:17-19 Genesis 18:20-22 Genesis 18:23-33 Genesis 19:1-3 Genesis 19:4-5 Genesis 19:6-9 Genesis 19:10-13 Genesis 19:14 Genesis 19:15-17 Genesis 19:18-19 Genesis 19:20-22 Genesis 19:24-26 Genesis 19:27-28 Genesis 19:29-30 Genesis 19:31-35 Genesis 19:36-38 Genesis 18:1-2 Now the LORD appeared to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre while he was sitting at the tent door in the heat of the day. When he raised his eyes and looked, behold, three men were standing opposite him; and when he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed down to the ground,\nTents were designed to hold in heat at night but flaps can open to allow breezes during the day.\nAbraham does not yet know that these three are supernatural, and we aren’t told when he realizes that they aren’t. Without any fanfare, all of a sudden, he knows he’s talking to the LORD\nGenesis 18:3-5 and said, “My Lord, if now I have found favor in Your sight, please do not pass Your servant by. “Please let a little water be brought and wash your feet, and make yourselves comfortable under the tree, and I will bring a piece of bread so that you may refresh yourselves; after that, you may go on since you have visited your servant.” And they said, “So do as you have said.”\nBy the standards of the day, Abraham was required to do this, but he went above and beyond, as we shall see in the next passage.\nHospitality may have had a pragmatic goal – you never knew when someone approaching could be an enemy. Here was a chance to potentially transform an enemy into a friend, at least temporarily.\nWashing the feet of guests was a standard act of hospitality, given the often dry and dusty roads of the ancient near east.\nOften a bowl was placed by the door and the guest washed their own feet – this appears to be what Abraham offers here.\nSome commentators will note that feet washing was so nasty, typically only the lowest servant could be assigned to wash another’s feet.\nOf course, this makes Jesus’ act at the Last Supper all the more remarkable.\nWalking in His Dust Hebrews 13:2 Do not neglect hospitality to strangers, for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it.\nWe typically think of entertaining and hospitality as something like a fellowship meal.\nWhile it includes that, more broadly, hospitality includes any act of aid and comfort.\nThink of the Good Samaritan.\nHospitality is loving your neighbor.\nNotice again God’s ways vs the World’s ways.\nThe world says look out for #1, never deny our own desires.\nEntertaining is OK as long as you get something out of it (showing off the fact that you have the means to host a big party, or maybe cultivate a new business contact). God says to give selflessly to help others who may never be able to repay you.\nPeter elaborates on this: “Above all, keep loving one another earnestly since love covers a multitude of sins. Show hospitality to one another without grumbling. As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God’s varied grace: whoever speaks, as one who speaks oracles of God; whoever serves, as one who serves by the strength that God supplies—in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. (1 Peter 4:8-11).\nGenesis 18:6-8 So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, “Quickly, prepare three measures of fine flour, knead it, and make bread cakes.” Abraham also ran to the herd and took a tender and choice calf and gave it to the servant, and he hurried to prepare it. He took curds and milk and the calf which he had prepared and set it before them, and he was standing by them under the tree as they ate.\nAbraham was not obligated to prepare a calf; yogurt and bread would have been sufficient.\nA measure is a seah, which is about 20 quarts. This was a banquet.\nOne of the more onerous of the Jewish dietary restrictions is that one cannot mix dairy and meat; this is curious as right here, Abraham is doing just that.\nIn restaurants, there are designated dairy and non-dairy sections; even if your meal doesn’t have any dairy, you are not allowed to sit in the dairy section. The restriction comes from Exodus 23:19, which only says, “you are not to boil a young goat in the milk of its mother.”\nThis tree is venerated in Hebron today.\nGenesis 18:9-12 Then they said to him, “Where is your wife, Sarah?” And he said, “There, in the tent.” He said, “I will certainly return to you at this time next year; and behold, your wife Sarah will have a son.” And Sarah was listening at the tent door, which was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; Sarah was past childbearing. So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, “After I have become old, am I to have pleasure, my lord being old also?”\nSarah was in the tent, likely because the tradition was women did not eat with men.

He opened the shaft of the Abyss, and there went up smoke from the shaft like the smoke of a huge furnace; the sun was darkened, and the sky too, by the smoke from the shaft. Then out of the smoke onto the earth came locusts, and they were given power like the power scorpions have on earth. They were instructed not to harm the grass on the earth, any green plant, or any tree, but only the people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads. The locusts were not allowed to kill them, only to inflict pain on them for five months, and the pain they caused was like the pain of a scorpion sting. In those days, people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will elude them. Now, these locusts looked like horses outfitted for battle. On their heads were what looked like crowns of gold, and their faces were like human faces. They had hair like women’s hair, and their teeth were like those of lions. Their chests were like iron breastplates, and the sound their wings made was like the roar of many horses and chariots rushing into battle. They had tails like those of scorpions, with stings, and in their tails was their power to hurt people for five months. They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is “Abaddon” and in our language, “Destroyer.” The first woe has passed, but there are still two woes to come. The sixth angel sounded his shofar, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the gold altar before God, saying to the sixth angel, the one with the shofar, “Release the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates!” And they were released. These four angels had been kept ready for this moment, for this day and month and year, to kill a third of mankind, and the number of cavalry soldiers was two hundred million! —I heard the number. Here is how the horses looked in the vision: the riders had breastplates that were fire-red, iris-blue, and sulfur-yellow; the horses’ heads were like lions’ heads; and from their mouths issued fire, smoke, and sulfur. It was these three plagues that killed a third of mankind—the fire, smoke, and sulfur issuing from the horses’ mouths. For the power of the horses was in their mouths—and also in their tails, for their tails were like snakes with heads, and with them, they could cause injury. The rest of mankind, those who were not killed by these plagues, even then did not turn from what they had made with their own hands—they did not stop worshipping demons and idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood, which cannot see or hear or walk. Nor did they turn from their murdering, their involvement with the occult and with drugs, their sexual immorality, or their stealing.\nIntroduction This passage has an allusion to Joel 2 “Blow a trumpet in Zion; sound an alarm on my holy mountain! Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, for the day of the LORD, is coming; it is near, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness! Like blackness, there is spread upon the mountains a great and powerful people; their like has never been before, nor will be again after them through the years of all generations. Fire devours before them, and behind them, a flame burns. The land is like the garden of Eden before them, but behind them, a desolate wilderness, and nothing escapes them. Their appearance is like the appearance of horses, and like war horses, they run. As with the rumbling of chariots, they leap on the tops of the mountains, like the crackling of a flame of fire devouring the stubble, like a powerful army drawn up for battle. Before them, peoples are in anguish; all faces grow pale. Like warriors, they charge; like soldiers, they scale the wall. They march each on his way; they do not swerve from their paths. They do not jostle one another; each marches in his path; they burst through the weapons and are not halted. They leap upon the city, they run upon the walls, they climb up into the houses, they enter through the windows like a thief. The earth quakes before them; the heavens tremble. The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining. The LORD utters his voice before his army, for his camp is exceedingly great; he who executes his word is powerful. For the day of the LORD is great and very awesome; who can endure it? “Yet even now,” declares the LORD, “return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning;” Tear your heart, not your garments; and turn to ADONAI your God. For he is merciful and compassionate, slow to anger, rich in grace, and willing to change his mind about disaster.

He was dressed in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head; his face was like the sun, his legs like columns of fire; and he had a little scroll lying open in his hand. He planted his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land and shouted in a voice as loud as the roar of a lion; and when he shouted, seven thunderclaps sounded with voices that spoke. When the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven say, \u0026#34;Seal up the things the seven thunders said, do not write them down!\u0026#34; Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted his right hand toward heaven and swore by the One who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and what is in it, earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it: \u0026#34;There will be no more delay; on the contrary, in the days of the sound from the seventh angel when he sounds his shofar, the hidden plan of God will be brought to completion, the Good News as he proclaimed it to his servants the prophets.\u0026#34; Next, the voice which I had heard from heaven spoke to me again and said, \u0026#34;Go, take the scroll lying open in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the land!\u0026#34; So, I went over to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll; and he said to me, \u0026#34;Take it and eat it. It will turn your stomach bitter, but in your mouth, it will be sweet as honey.\u0026#34; I took the little scroll from the angel\u0026#39;s hand and ate it; and in my mouth, it was sweet as honey; but after I had swallowed it, my stomach turned bitter. Then I was told, \u0026#34;You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings.\u0026#34;\nDaniel 12 Again, we have a brief intermission between the 6th and 7th trumpets, just as we did between the 6th and 7th seals. We have the seven thunders here, and, in Chapter 11, we will have the two witnesses. It’s important to keep in mind that when John wrote this, there were no such things as chapter breaks. As best we can, we need to remove the chapter breaks and read Revelation as a single continuous document.\nRevelation 10 has many similarities to Daniel 12:\nDaniel 12:1-10: “At that time shall arise, Michael, the great prince who has charge of your people. And there shall be a time of trouble, such as never has been since there was a nation till that time. But at that time, your people shall be delivered, everyone whose name shall be found written in the book. And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. And those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the sky above; and those who turn many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever. But you, Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book until the time of the end. Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase.” Then I, Daniel, looked, and behold, two others stood, one on this bank of the stream and one on that bank of the stream. And someone said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream, “How long shall it be till the end of these wonders?” And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream; he raised his right hand and his left hand toward heaven and swore by him who lives forever that it would be for a time, times, and half a time, and that when the shattering of the power of the holy people comes to an end all these things would be finished. I heard, but I did not understand. Then I said, “O my lord, what shall be the outcome of these things?” He said, “Go your way, Daniel, for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of the end. Many shall purify themselves and make themselves white and be refined, but the wicked shall act wickedly. And none of the wicked shall understand, but those who are wise shall understand.\nRev 10:1-3 Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head, and his face was like the sun and his legs like pillars of fire. He had a little scroll open in his hand. And he set his right foot on the sea, his left foot on the land, and called out with a loud voice, like a lion roaring. Another angel. Mighty angel #1 was in Rev 5:2, And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?”\nSo this is Mighty angel #2. Apparently, he’s large, with one foot on land and the other on sea, but also large in authority and dominion. The mission is the entire world.\nDescription:\n“He comes with the clouds” is a familiar description of Jesus.\nRainbow was the covenant sign God gave to Noah after the Flood.\nFace like the sun and legs like bronze are descriptions from Revelation 1.\nHere is a hint that John was at least thinking in Hebrew Hebrew has the same word for feet and legs; however, only legs can be said …","date":1653609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658354633,"objectID":"379d9dda28dbd8fce8f6dc354c300035","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/rev-10/","publishdate":"2022-05-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/rev-10/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Seven Thunders - Revelation 10","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Video Introduction Video Introduction Written commentary coming soon.\n","date":1622332800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661983304,"objectID":"1e2a77d508fc9537d75aa0c0d50c3dc1","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb3/19-parables/","publishdate":"2021-05-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb3/19-parables/","section":"commentary","summary":"Table of Contents Video Introduction Video Introduction Written commentary coming soon.","tags":["Matthew 13"],"title":"Parables ✧ Gospel Backgrounds 19","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["inSITES"],"content":"Compromising – January 11, 2023 Today was especially exciting because, although this is not my first time in Israel, every site we visited was one I’d not seen before. The theme of the day was compromising (Samson at Beth Shemesh) vs. being faithful (David v. Goliath at the Valley of Elah).\nRelated Devotionals: Azekah: Bet Guvrin: Yad HaShmonah We began the day by visiting Yad HaShmonah biblical garden. The first thing our guide Ronan pointed it is that in the Bible, a garden has nothing to do with flowers. It revolves around the seven spices of Deuteronomy 8: wheat, barley, grapes, figs, pomegranates, olives, and dates. There is also a replica watchtower, synagogue, and rolling stone tomb. In general, we learned all about life in ancient Israel. This is very near the area of Kiryat Jearim where we recounted the saga of the Ark’s capture and subsequent return by the Philistines in 1st Samuel 4-7. The story began by the Israelites’ going into battle without God. Then instead of calling upon God the way Joshua and Moses did, they thought all they needed was the Ark, which was basically supposed to be a good luck charm of sorts. It’s a great story full of geographic references and, more importantly, personal application.\nBeth Shemesh We next moved just over the hill to Beth Shemesh and the Sorek valley, which is the setting of one of the more famous compromisers, Samson. Almost every location referenced in Judges 13-16 is visible from Beth Shemesh and almost every act of Samson involves some form of compromise. Yet, there he is in Hebrews 11. That should give all of us hope!\nAlso at Beth Shemesh was an example of an ancient cistern. Pastor Randy then had us read Jeremiah 38 where Jeremiah was thrown into a muddy cistern. As we were standing in a slightly muddy cistern, the passage came to life. The photo below is looking up at the roof with the opening. The cave was completely dark without flashlights. Other references to being thrown into or lifted out of a pit such as Psalm 40 and possibly Jesus before Caiaphas also came to mind (in what could be Caiaphas’ house, they found a dungeon/pit, where possibly prisoners were kept.)\nAzekah From there it was to Azekah and the story of David and Goliath. Azekah is a hill overlooking the valley. We could see the hills where 1 Samuel 17 records the Philistine and Israelite armies, and of course the valley itself, where we stopped to gather 5 smooth stones from the brook just as David did. On this day, David did not compromise. Of the many directions Pastor Rich could have with this wonderful story, he focused on David as the unlikely savior of Israel and how Jesus is also unlikely. He’s not the Hero you’re looking for. Here is a quick devotional I recorded [youtube url=\u0026#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2QqSph7j7Q\u0026#34;]. We also discussed some reasons from archeology we can have even more confidence in the biblical account of David and Solomon.\nBet Guvrin We concluded the day with a visit to Bet Guvrin, known in Old Testament times as Mareshah. This is the home of Micah the prophet. In Micah 6, God calls the hills around Mareshah to be the jury as he presents his case. Here is another brief devotional: [youtube url=\u0026#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqSC8LS1KbI\u0026#34;]\nWe then took a beautiful sunset/dusk drive through the Negev desert and Judean wilderness on our way to the hotel at the Dead Sea. Here is our route according to Google.\nMore tomorrow!\n","date":1675036800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675486072,"objectID":"0f3ed1918e7e1da0184fb3a547f6ecdf","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/sites/2023-blog/23-trip-journal-1-shephelah/","publishdate":"2023-01-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/sites/2023-blog/23-trip-journal-1-shephelah/","section":"sites","summary":"Compromising – January 11, 2023 Today was especially exciting because, although this is not my first time in Israel, every site we visited was one I’d not seen before. The theme of the day was compromising (Samson at Beth Shemesh) vs.","tags":[],"title":"2023 Trip Journal #1: Shephelah","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Genesis"],"content":" Table of Contents Setting Genesis 20:1 Genesis 20:2 Genesis 20:3-5 Genesis 20:6-8 Genesis 20:9-10 Genesis 20:11-13 Genesis 20:14-16 In His Dust Talmidim Way Insight Genesis 20:17-18 Setting These episodes take place primarily in Gerar and Beersheba.\nAbraham relocates to Gerar, a pagan kingdom (blue arrow towards Gerar) where he has another lack of faith (he didn’t learn the lesson from Egypt) in which he tells a 1/2 truth that Sarah was his sister. God intervened again to preserve the purity of his promise.\nIsaac, the son of the Promise (Gal 4:23-26) is born possibly at Gerar\nIn Chapter 21, Abraham makes a treaty with the king of Gerar at Beersheva - well of seven/oath1\nGenesis 20:1 From there Abraham journeyed toward the territory of the Negeb and lived between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar.\nOne reason we don’t have many archeological remains from this period is the nomadic lifestyle. People like Abraham moved somewhere, then moved on, often being deliberate about not leaving a trace.\nAlmost all Hebrew words have the accent on the last syllable. One exception is certain two syllable word that have a short e vowel. So the word for desert is not pronounced nuh-GEV, but NEH-gev.\nGerar is possibly a region, not a specific city, but many archeologists point to this location about 15 miles northwest of Beersheva as the likely location.2\nKadesh, or Kadesh Barnea, will become a pivotal location later in the Torah.\nIt is here that the 12 spies returned. When the 10 brought back a bad report and spread fear through the camp, a riot ensued. As punishment, God sentenced the people to wander in the wilderness for 38 more years (a total of 40), while that generation died off, except for the two spies who brought back a good report: Joshua and Caleb. Genesis 20:2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.\nOy vey!\nThis is the eighth test of Abraham, according to the sages. He doesn’t do so well.\nWe sometimes face the same challenges repeatedly because we keep getting them wrong.\nWhatever blind spot Abraham has in his faith, he, unfortunately, passes it down to Isaac, who will pull the same ruse with Rebekah.\nA 99-year-old woman was desirable. She must have been extremely beautiful.\nAbimelech comes from two Hebrew words, Avi – my father and Melech – king.\nIt is probably a title, “my father the king” (like a “lord and master” title in medieval times) versus a given name. Genesis 20:3-5 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man’s wife.” Now Abimelech had not approached her. So he said, “Lord, will you kill an innocent people? Did he not himself say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.”\nIn one of the many mysteries of God, He periodically makes Himself known to non-Israelites. He also does this with Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar. Even more puzzling is that none of the three are recorded as putting their faith in the God of Abraham despite the divine encounter. Nebuchadnezzar comes closest in Daniel 4, but there is little historical evidence that he had a major change of heart. Genesis 20:6-8 Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her. Now then, return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you, and you shall live. But if you do not return her, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours.” So Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things. And the men were very much afraid.\nCalling Abraham a “prophet” might have been a term that Abimelech understood to mean Abraham had a unique relationship with his God.\nAbraham was not necessarily a giver of prophecy the way we think of the term (as it relates to Elijah, Isaiah, and so forth).\nProphecy is not limited to the prediction and fulfillment of future events.\nA prophet is someone who speaks the words of God.\nPragmatically, Abimelech also would have understood that as a prophet, Abraham had the ability to bless Abimelech, which in his mind would have equated to material blessings.\nGenesis 20:9-10 Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done.” And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you see, that you did this thing?”\nHe’s not wrong. Abraham blew his witness here.\nI love the way the KJV words 2 Sam 12:14. 2 Samuel 12:14 (KJV) by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme\nThis is when Nathan confronts David over his sin with Bathsheba.\nMost of the other …","date":1674691200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675603651,"objectID":"0ec8d746c704e71feb92ce54258121e8","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/genesis/gen2/gen20/","publishdate":"2023-01-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/genesis/gen2/gen20/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Genesis 20 - Abraham and Abimelech","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Revelation Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Revelation 11 Introduction Rev 11:1-2 Rev 11:3 Rev 11:4 Rev 11:5-6 Rev 11:7-8 Rev 11:9-10 Rev 11:11-12 Rev 11:13-14 Rev 11:15-17 Rev 11:18 Rev 11:19 Seven Great Openings Perspective - we’re never alone Video\nRevelation 11 I was given a measuring rod like a stick and told, \u0026#34;Get up, and measure the Temple of God and the altar, and count how many people are worshipping there! But the court outside the Temple, leave that out; don\u0026#39;t measure it; because it has been given to the Goyim, and they will trample over the holy city for forty-two months. \u0026#34;Also, I will give power to my two witnesses; and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, dressed in sackcloth.\u0026#34; These are the two olive trees and the two menorahs standing before the Lord of the earth. If anyone tries to do them harm, fire comes out of their mouth and consumes their enemies—yes, if anyone tries to harm them, that is how he must die. They have the authority to shut up the sky so that no rain falls during the period of their prophesying; also, they have the authority to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want. When they finish their witnessing, the beast coming up out of the Abyss will fight against them, overcome them and kill them; and their dead bodies will lie in the main street of the great city whose name, to reflect its spiritual condition, is \u0026#34;S\u0026#39;dom\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;Egypt\u0026#34;—the city where their Lord was executed on a stake. Some from the nations, tribes, languages, and peoples see their bodies for three-and-a-half days and do not permit the corpses to be placed in a tomb. The people living in the Land rejoice over them, they celebrate and send each other gifts, because these two prophets tormented them so. But after the three-and-a-half days a breath of life from God entered them, they stood up on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them. Then the two heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, \u0026#34;Come up here!\u0026#34; And they went up into heaven in a cloud, while their enemies watched them. In that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were awestruck and gave glory to the God of heaven. The second woe has passed; see, the third woe is coming quickly. The seventh angel sounded his shofar; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, \u0026#34;The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and his Messiah, and he will rule forever and ever!\u0026#34; The twenty-four elders sitting on their thrones in God\u0026#39;s presence fell on their faces and worshipped God, saying, \u0026#34;We thank you, Adonai, God of heaven\u0026#39;s armies, the One who is and was, that you have taken your power and have begun to rule. \u0026#34;The Goyim raged. But now your rage has come, the time for the dead to be judged, the time for rewarding your servants the prophets, and your holy people, those who stand in awe of your name, both small and great. It is also the time for destroying those who destroy the earth.\u0026#34; Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened, and the Ark of the Covenant was seen in his Temple; and there were flashes of lightning, voices, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and violent hail.\nIntroduction Missler notes a few elements related to setting:\nTime: first half of 70th week of Daniel\nPlace: Begins in Jerusalem, specifically note Israel has a restored Temple. Ends in heaven.\nWe have a distinction between Jews and nations, which Stern calls “Goyim.”\nGoyim are those gentiles/gentile nations at enmity with God and His people.\nGentiles in the church are supposed to be Ger Toshav not goyim.\nGer Toshav is the term in the Hebrew Bible to denote non-Jews who follow the God of Israel. Literally, it means “resident alien” but connotatively it refers to a “righteous gentile.”\nSadly many in the church throughout history have acted more like goyim, leading most Jews to refer to Christians as Goyim, but that’s for another discussion.\nIn any case, the above distinction between Jews and Goyim, with no mention of the church, leads many to believe that the church is not present during this period in time.\nWe are roughly midway through the book\nChapter 11 will see the conclusion of the 2nd woe and the beginning of the 7th Trumpet.\nRev 11:1-2 I was given a measuring rod like a stick and told, \u0026#34;Get up, and measure the Temple of God and the altar, and count how many people are worshipping there! 2 But the court outside the Temple, leave that out; don\u0026#39;t measure it; because it has been given to the Goyim, and they will trample over the holy city for forty-two months.\nTemple: Matthew 24:15 says “when you see the abomination…standing in the holy pace…”, there has to be a temple standing.\nIt had been well past 42 months since the destruction of the Temple when Revelation was written.\nEither this prophecy had to be fulfilled before 70 CE or there is another temple yet future.\nThe enemies of God have had a particular fascination with destroying or …","date":1654128000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658354633,"objectID":"c7a80807507b27d885e8b268401ccb46","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/rev11/","publishdate":"2022-06-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/rev11/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Revelation 11 - Two Witnesses","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Video Introduction Video Introduction Written commentary coming soon.\n","date":1622937600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661983304,"objectID":"ed27d10a09d4aebaa6afa5bcbb2923e1","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb3/20-the-other-side/","publishdate":"2021-06-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb3/20-the-other-side/","section":"commentary","summary":"Table of Contents Video Introduction Video Introduction Written commentary coming soon.","tags":["Matthew 8","Matthew 9","Mark 4","Luke 8"],"title":"The Other Side ✧ Gospel Backgrounds 20","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Genesis"],"content":" Table of Contents Video Geography Genesis 21 and Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews Genesis 21:1-3 Genesis 21:4-7 Genesis 21:8-10 Walking In His Dust Along The Talmidim Way Genesis 21:11-13 Genesis 21:14-16 Genesis 21:17-19 Walking In His Dust Along The Talmidim Way Genesis 21:20-21 Genesis 21:22-24 Genesis 21:25 In His Dust Talmidim Way Insight Genesis 21:27-28 Genesis 21:29-31 Genesis 21:32 Genesis 21:33-34 Video Geography The orange arrow from Gerar (box 6) towards Egypt marks the expulsion of Ishmael and Hagar into the wilderness of Beersheba\nSeparation was necessary to protect the son of the promise\nThe red arrow from Beersheba to Jerusalem (box 7) denotes the path to and from the offering of Isaac.\nMap credit1\nGenesis 21 and Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews An understanding of Genesis 21 is paramount to understanding Paul’s/Hebrew’s arguments.\nRomans, Galatians, and Hebrews and only these three New Testament books discuss Genesis 21.\nActs references the birth of Isaac; James and Hebrews reference the sacrifice of Isaac in Genesis 22. It is easy to read Galatians and come away that Paul was somehow anti-law or anti-Judaism.\nThis train of thought is deeply flawed and runs the risk of missing Paul’s points entirely.\nHe is focused not on Judaism as a whole, but on the Messiah-rejecting Jews who are knowingly or unknowingly continuing in legalism instead of accepting the free gift the Messiah brings.\nAs an aside, the three books, and only these three New Testament books quote Habakkuk 2:4 (KJV) “but the just shall live by his faith.”\nRomans, Galatians, and Hebrews seem to form a trilogy on Habakkuk 2:4.\nTheme of Romans: who are the justified?\nTheme of Galatians: how shall the justified live?\nTheme of Hebrews: faith in the promises.\nThis leads many to suspect Paul is the author of Hebrews. If he did not, this is an even greater miracle, because whoever wrote Hebrews unknowingly completed the trilogy!\nGenesis 21:1-3 Then the LORD took note of Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for Sarah as He had promised. So Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him. Abraham named his son who was born to him, the son whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.\nGalatians 4:23 But the son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, and the son by the free woman through the promise.\nHebrews 11:11 By faith even Sarah herself received the ability to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised.\nOther translations say “God remembered Sarah.”\nThis is not that God forgot, but that He remembered His promise. “Appointed time” = mo’ed. The Jewish festivals are Moedim. Shabbat is a moed. A moed is a big deal.\nPerhaps Isaac was born on a festival day, just as some speculate Jesus might have been born on Yom Kippur or the first day of Tabernacles.\nEither day fits – He is our atonement and he dwells/tabernacles among us. “The Bible uses a miraculous birth to indicate that God has set aside that child for some great purpose.” (SOM 94)\nYitzhak is related to the Hebrew verb צחק, which means to laugh, but often carries a nuanced connotation of mocking/scorning or even sexual play.\nWe’ll unpack more at verse 9. Genesis 21:4-7 Then Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. Now Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me.” And she said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have given birth to a son in his old age.”\nPractically, in an age of high infant mortality rates, eight days, an infant was considered viable.\nIsaac was circumcised according to the letter of the law on the 8th day.\nThis is contrasted with Ishmael, who was circumcised at age 13; he was still circumcised, but in a typological sense, not when he “should” have been according to the Law.\nGiven the nuanced meaning of Tzahaq, this may not necessarily be laughing in joy, but laughing in amazement. Sarah and Abraham both laughed in disbelief and perhaps mockery.\nIsaac’s birth was a true miracle.\nThere is an overarching theme in the Bible of God miraculously opening a closed womb. This extends to Mary; although she was not barren in the traditional sense, her womb was miraculously opened.\nGod made EVERYTHING in Sarah come to life – she didn’t just give birth but was able to nurse for a couple of years after.\nGenesis 21:8-10 And the child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. Now Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking Isaac. Therefore she said to Abraham, “Drive out this slave woman and her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not be an heir with my son Isaac!”\nThis episode becomes symbolic of the affliction of the Hebrew/Jewish people throughout the ages.\nGalatians 4:29 But as at that time the son …","date":1675382400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675603651,"objectID":"28fee2086fa0d9eec0a1aa47af4e6044","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/genesis/gen2/gen21/","publishdate":"2023-02-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/genesis/gen2/gen21/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Genesis 21  - Abraham and Isaac","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Revelation Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Revelation 12 Introduction – Declarations of War Rev 12:1-2 Rev 12:3 Rev 12:4 Rev 12:5-6 Rev 12:7-8 Rev 12:9 Rev 12:10-11 Rev 12:12-13 Rev 12:14 Rev 12:15 Rev 12:16 Rev 12:17 Mystery verse Video\nRevelation 12 (Rev 11:19) Then God’s temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple. There were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail.\nAnd a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. She was pregnant and was crying out in birth pains and the agony of giving birth.\nA. 3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. 4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.\nB. 5 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne. 6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.\nC. 7 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, 8 And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. 9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.\nD. 10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. 11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. 12 Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them.\nC’. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.\nB’. 14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.\nA’. 15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood. 16 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth. 17And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.\nIntroduction – Declarations of War The chapter break probably should have occurred after 11:18. Here the scene shifted to the heavenly throne room, and this perspective is continued in Chapter 12.\nThings that began in Genesis have their fulfillment in Revelation. In the account of the Fall, we actually have two declarations of war. In Genesis 3:1-5 we have the serpent declaring war on humanity, and then in Genesis 3:15, we have God declaring war on the serpent.\nGenesis 3:1-19 Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God actually say, ‘You shall not eat of any tree in the garden’?” And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden, but God said, ‘You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.’” But the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate. Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths. And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden. But the LORD God called to the man and said to him, “Where are you?” And he said, “I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.” He said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?” The man …","date":1654819200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654902137,"objectID":"07f47a45c640b89ba003db8ba573d1c8","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/rev12/","publishdate":"2022-06-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/rev12/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Revelation 12","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Video Video ","date":1622937600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661983304,"objectID":"30b44e8a16eb35e7b7f14b9f4ca8fdc2","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb3/21-apostles-discourse/","publishdate":"2021-06-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb3/21-apostles-discourse/","section":"commentary","summary":" Table of Contents Video Video ","tags":["Matthew 9","Mark 6","Luke 9","Luke 10"],"title":"Apostles' Discourse ✧ Gospel Backgrounds 21","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Genesis"],"content":" Table of Contents Videos Geography Genesis 21 and Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews Genesis 21:1-3 Genesis 21:4-7 Genesis 21:8-10 Walking In His Dust Along The Talmidim Way Genesis 21:11-13 Genesis 21:14-16 Genesis 21:17-19 Walking In His Dust Along The Talmidim Way Genesis 21:20-21 Genesis 22 - Abraham’s 10th test: The Akedah of Isaac Genesis 22:1 Genesis 22:2-3 Genesis 22:4 Genesis 22:5 Genesis 22:6-7 Genesis 22:8 Genesis 22:9 – the binding Genesis 22:10-12 – the “resurrection” Genesis 22:13-14 – the substitute Genesis 22:15-18 Walking In His Dust Along The Talmidim Way Genesis 22:19 Genesis 22:20-24 Final Thoughts We need to look beyond A Covenantal Obligation?

On its horns were ten royal crowns and, on its heads, blasphemous names. The beast which I saw was like a leopard, but with feet like those of a bear and a mouth like the mouth of a lion. To it, the dragon gave its power, its throne, and great authority.\nOne of the heads of the beast appeared to have received a fatal wound, but its fatal wound was healed, and the whole earth followed after the beast in amazement. They worshipped the dragon because he had given his authority to the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast? Who can fight against it?” It was given a mouth speaking arrogant blasphemies, and it was given authority to act for forty-two months.\nSo it opened its mouth in blasphemies against God to insult his name and his Sh’khinah, and those living in heaven; it was allowed to make war on God’s holy people and to defeat them; and it was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation. Everyone living on earth will worship it except those whose names are written in the Book of Life belonging to the Lamb slaughtered before the world was founded. Those who have ears, let them hear!\n“If anyone is meant for captivity, into captivity he goes! If anyone is to be killed with the sword, with the sword he is to be killed!” This is when God’s holy people must persevere and trust! Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. It had two horns like those of a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon. It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence; and it makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, the one whose fatal wound had been healed. It performs great miracles, even causing fire to come down from heaven onto the earth as people watch. It deceives the people living on earth by the miracles it is allowed to perform in the presence of the beast, and it tells them to make an image honoring the beast that was struck by the sword but came alive again.\nIt was allowed to put breath into the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast could even speak; and it was allowed to cause anyone who would not worship the image of the beast to be put to death. Also, it forces everyone—great and small, rich and poor, free and slave—to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead preventing anyone from buying or selling unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name. This is where wisdom is needed; those who understand should count the number of the beast, for it is the number of a person, and its number is 666.\nPerspective I am not anxious to know the number of the Beast, and I am thankful I will not have to live in that period. I am very thankful today that I know Jesus Christ as my Savior. Instead of spending time with Antichrist, I want to know Jesus Christ. I can say with Paul: “That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death” (Php 3:10).\nJ. Vernon McGee\nRev 13:1 And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads, with ten diadems on its horns and blasphemous names on its heads.\nThe “sea” is usually a reference to the Mediterranean Sea. Since it was gentiles who sailed upon it, the “sea” became a euphemism for the gentile nations.\nFrom the perspective of the middle east, Rome arose out of the Sea.\nLast time, we looked at Daniel 7 where Daniel also saw four beasts out of the sea.\nBeast #1 – (Dan 7:4) – Lion (presumed to be Babylon) – 1 head and 0 horns\nBeast #2 – (Dan 7:5) Bear (Medio-Persia) – 1 head and 0 horns\nBeast #3 – (Dan 7:6) Leopard (Greek) – 4 heads and 0 horns\nBeast #4 – (Dan 7:7) Dreadful (Rome) – 1 head and 10 horns\nTotal: 7 heads and 10 horns\nHorns?: Julius Caesar, Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, (Galba, Otho, Vitellius), Vespesian (11^th^, little horn might be Domitian)\nDan 7:8 I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.\nBlasphemous names could refer to the fact that the Roman Emperors demanded to be worshipped as gods, as we talked about when we went through the 7 letters.\nAs we say often, these horns are not named so we are just speculating as to what the 1st-century audience’s interpretation might have been.\nWe have more clues in Revelation 17\nRev 17:9-13 This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated; they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, …","date":1655510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658354633,"objectID":"701ad97e6cffdeb15975c0350f04baf6","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/rev13/","publishdate":"2022-06-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/rev13/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Beast and False Prophet - Revelation 13","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Read/hear the portions:\nSummary\nVideo\n","date":1647993600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661983304,"objectID":"6a4add6f75dcbeef55548e201214d9fe","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb3/22-death-of-john/","publishdate":"2022-03-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb3/22-death-of-john/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"22.

I heard a sound from heaven like the sound of rushing waters and like the sound of pealing thunder; the sound I heard was also like that of harpists playing on their harps. They were singing a new song before the throne and before the four living beings and the elders, and no one could learn the song except the 144,000 who have been ransomed from the world. These are the ones who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins; they follow the Lamb wherever he goes; they have been ransomed from among humanity as firstfruits for God and the Lamb; on their lips no lie was found—they are without defect.\nNext, I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven with everlasting Good News to proclaim to those living on the earth—to every nation, tribe, language, and people. In a loud voice, he said, “Fear God, give Him glory, for the hour has come when he will pass judgment! Worship the One who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water!” Another angel, a second one, followed, saying, “She has fallen! She has fallen! Bavel (Babylon) the Great! She made all the nations drink the wine of God’s fury caused by her whoring!”\nAnother angel, a third one, followed them and said in a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives the mark on his forehead or on his hand, he will indeed drink the wine of God’s fury poured undiluted into the cup of his rage. He will be tormented by fire and sulfur before the holy angels and before the Lamb, and the smoke from their tormenting goes up forever and ever. They have no rest, day or night, those who worship the beast and its image and those who receive the mark of its name.” This is when perseverance is needed on the part of God’s people, those who observe his commands and exercise Yeshua’s faithfulness.\nNext, I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write: ‘How blessed are the dead who die united with the Lord, from now on!’ ‘Yes,’ says the Spirit, ’now they may rest from their efforts, for the things they have accomplished follow along with them.’ \u0026#34; Then I looked, and there before me was a white cloud. Sitting on the cloud was someone like a Son of Man with a gold crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. Another angel came out of the Temple and shouted to the one sitting on the cloud, “Start using your sickle to reap, because the time to reap has come—the earth’s harvest is ripe!” The one sitting on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested. Another angel came out of the Temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle.\nThen out from the altar went yet another angel, who was in charge of the fire; and he called in a loud voice to the one with the sharp sickle, “Use your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of grapes from the earth’s vine, because they are ripe!” The angel swung his sickle down onto the earth, gathered the earth’s grapes, and threw them into the great winepress of God’s fury. The winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood flowed from the winepress as high as the horses’ bridles for two hundred miles!\nLesson Introduction These chapters stand In opposition/juxtaposition to the mark of the beast, where the followers chanted, “who is like the beast?”\nWe are going to flash forward to the end to give the readers justification to hold fast.\nThe 5th, 6th, and 7th angels call for a grape harvest and we will see that God’s “winepress” features prominently in chapter 14.\n14:1 - 15:4 appears to describe the same events that occur in Revelation 19:11-21\nThen I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war. His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems, and he has a name written that no one knows but himself. He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is The Word of God. And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, were following him on white horses. From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords. Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he called to all the birds that fly directly overhead, “Come, gather for the great supper of God, to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and their …","date":1655942400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658354633,"objectID":"3952f91011457f598e9d28e984a288c1","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/rev14/","publishdate":"2022-06-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/rev14/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Winepress - Revelation 14 \u0026 15","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Read/hear the portions:\nSummary\n**Videos **\n","date":1624752000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661983304,"objectID":"27d6c39bcebf3dbf8df3741dbfc24744","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb3/23-bread-of-life/","publishdate":"2021-06-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb3/23-bread-of-life/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"23 Bread of Life","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Revelation Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Revelation 16 Read the portion Graphics Rev 16:1 Rev 16:2 Rev 16:3 Rev 16:4 Rev 16:5-7 Rev 16:8-9 Rev 16:10-11 Rev 16:12 Rev 16:13-14 Rev 16:15 Rev 16:16 Rev 16:17 Rev 16:18-19 Rev 16:20-21 Conclusion Video\nRevelation 16 Read the portion 15-5-8 After this I looked, and the sanctuary (that is, the Tent of Witness in heaven) was opened, and out of the sanctuary came the seven angels with the seven plagues. They were dressed in clean bright linen and had gold belts around their chests. One of the four living beings gave to the seven angels seven gold bowls filled with the fury of God, who lives forever and ever. Then the sanctuary was filled with smoke from God’s Sh’khinah, that is, from his power; and no one could enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels had accomplished their purpose. Then I heard a loud voice from the temple telling the seven angels, “Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God.” So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and harmful and painful sores came upon the people who bore the mark of the beast and worshiped its image. The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became like the blood of a corpse, and every living thing died that was in the sea. The third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood. And I heard the angel in charge of the waters say, “Just are you, O Holy One, who is and who was, for you brought these judgments. For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. It is what they deserve!” And I heard the altar saying, “Yes, Lord God the Almighty, true and just are your judgments!” The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was allowed to scorch people with fire. They were scorched by the fierce heat, and they cursed the name of God who had power over these plagues. They did not repent and give him glory. The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in anguish and cursed the God of heaven for their pain and sores. They did not repent of their deeds. The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, to prepare the way for the kings from the east. And I saw, coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs. For they are demonic spirits, performing signs, who go abroad to the kings of the whole world, to assemble them for battle on the great day of God the Almighty. (“Behold, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake, keeping his garments on, that he may not go about naked and be seen exposed!”) And they assembled them at the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon. The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple, from the throne, saying, “It is done!” And there were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, and a great earthquake such as there had never been since man was on the earth, so great was that earthquake. The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell, and God remembered Babylon the great, to make her drain the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath. And every island fled away, and no mountains were to be found. And great hailstones, about one hundred pounds each, fell from heaven on people; and they cursed God for the plague of the hail because the plague was so severe. Graphics Graphics courtesy of Mark Berry https://visualunit.me/\nThere is some overlap between the seven bowls and the ten plagues\nThere is also overlap between Revelation 8 (the trumpet judgments) and Revelation 16, suggesting to some that that Revelation should be read in terms of retelling the same events with different focus/intensity versus a linear narrative.\nAn example might be Joseph’s interpretation of Pharoah’s two dreams in Genesis 41.\nThe first dream was 7 emaciated cows who ate the seven fat cows. The second dream was seven blighted ears of corn that consumed seven plump, full ears of corn. The two visions spoke of the same event: the seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine.\nA valid interpretation of Revelation is that the Seals, Trumpets and Bowls are all speaking of the same events, as opposed to 21 different and distinct judgments (seven seal judgments, followed by seven trumpet judgments, followed by seven bowl judgments).\nIn any case, this would have reminded John’s readers that they were protected from God’s judgments just like the Israelites of old.\nTheir deliverance is drawing near.\nZechariah 14\nWe have looked at key Old Testament chapters such as Daniel 7. Another one of these is Zechariah 14. Let’s become familiar with this important passage.\nBehold, a day is coming for the LORD, when the spoil taken from you will be divided in …","date":1656460800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658354633,"objectID":"dc69d4e18866150d3541e41add72f2e2","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/rev16/","publishdate":"2022-06-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/rev16/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Seven Bowls - Revelation 16","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Read/hear the portions:\nSummary\nVideo\n","date":1625961600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661983304,"objectID":"aa53cc109c06392044552e2a69c4001e","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb3/24-traditions-of-men/","publishdate":"2021-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb3/24-traditions-of-men/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"24 Traditions of Men","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Revelation Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Revelation 17 – the woman who rides the beast Introduction Whom does the woman represent?

The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet and adorned with gold and jewels and pearls, holding in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her sexual immorality. And on her forehead was written a name of mystery: “Babylon the great, mother of prostitutes and of earth’s abominations.” And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints, the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I marveled greatly. But the angel said to me, “Why do you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her. The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to rise from the bottomless pit and go to destruction. And the dwellers on earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel to see the beast because it was and is not and is to come. This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated; they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he does come he must remain only a little while. As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven, and it goes to destruction. And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power, but they are to receive authority as kings for one hour, together with the beast. These are of one mind, and they hand over their power and authority to the beast. They will make war on the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with him are called and chosen and faithful.” And the angel said to me, “The waters that you saw, where the prostitute is seated, are peoples and multitudes and nations and languages. And the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast will hate the prostitute. They will make her desolate and naked, devour her flesh and burn her up with fire, for God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by being of one mind and handing over their royal power to the beast until the words of God are fulfilled. And the woman that you saw is the great city that has dominion over the kings of the earth.”\nIntroduction God refers to idolatry as spiritual adultery. Following false gods is spiritually equivalent to engaging a prostitute. He applies this primarily to his unfaithful people (including Gentile believers, as we saw in the letters to Pergamum and Thyatira) and pagan nations.\nIsaiah 26 portrays Tyre as a harlot: Isa 23:16 “Take a harp; go about the city, O forgotten prostitute! Make sweet melody; sing many songs, that you may be remembered.”\nNahum also describes Nineveh as a harlot and a sorceress: Nah 3:4-5 And all for the countless whorings of the prostitute, graceful and deadly charms, who betrays nations with her whorings, and peoples with her charms. [5] Behold, I am against you, declares the LORD of hosts, and will lift up your skirts over your face; and I will make nations look at your nakedness and kingdoms at your shame.\nHere in Revelation, the Harlot symbolism is both literal and figurative.\nShe is described as a prostitute and a sorceress (Rev 18:23),\nShe is also an agent of the system to entice others, which is idolatry.\nWhat is a harlot? Imitation love. False affection. Intimacy for hire. Both parties knowingly engage in deceit—the ultimate symbol of broken fidelity.\nIs there anything in your life that fits one or all of those definitions? A job? A habit? A possession? A person?\nDeu 23:2 “No one born of a forbidden union may enter the assembly of the LORD. Even to the tenth generation, none of his descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD.\nWhenever we enjoin with a harlot (literal or figurative), we “father” or “give birth to” an illegitimate offspring that interferes in our relationship with God. Just as Jesus makes a way for one who was literally born of a forbidden union, He can cleanse all our forbidden works and make us right with God.\nWhom does the woman represent? Fairly or unfairly, protestants have equated the woman of Revelation 17 to the Catholic Church.\nThe …","date":1657152000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658354633,"objectID":"114467a59df9ea2168f697b8be63f5b0","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/rev17/","publishdate":"2022-07-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/rev17/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Harlot - Revelation 17","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Read/hear the portions:\nSummary\nVideo\n","date":1626566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661983304,"objectID":"a3a790a24a23ea5ade06912937e21be7","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb3/25-upon-this-rock/","publishdate":"2021-07-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb3/25-upon-this-rock/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"25 Upon This Rock","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Revelation Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Revelation 18 – Babylon has Fallen!

After these things, I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, the earth was lit up by his splendor. He cried out in a strong voice, “She has fallen! She has fallen! Bavel the Great! She has become a home for demons, a prison for every unclean spirit, a prison for every unclean, hated bird. “For all the nations have drunk of the wine of God’s fury caused by her whoring—yes, the kings of the earth went whoring with her, and from her unrestrained love of luxury the world’s businessmen have grown rich.” Then I heard another voice out of heaven say: “My people, come out of her! so that you will not share in her sins, so that you will not be infected by her plagues, for her sins are a sticky mass piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes. “Render to her as she rendered to others! Pay her back double for what she has done! Use the cup in which she has brewed to brew her a double-sized drink! “Give her as much torment and sorrow as the glory and luxury she gave herself! For in her heart she says, ‘I sit a queen—I am not a widow, I will never see sorrow.’ “Therefore, her plagues will come in a single day—death, sorrow and famine; and she will be burned with fire, because Adonai, God, her Judge, is mighty” The kings of the earth who went whoring with her and shared her luxury will sob and wail over her when they see the smoke as she burns. Standing at a distance, for fear of her torment, they will say, “Oh no! The great city! Bavel, the mighty city! In a single hour your judgment has come!” The world’s businessmen weep and mourn over her, because no one is buying their merchandise any more— stocks of gold and silver, gems and pearls, fine linen and purple, silk and scarlet, all rare woods, all ivory goods, all kinds of things made of scented wood, brass, iron and marble; cinnamon, cardamom, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, oil, flour, grain, cattle, sheep, horses, chariots—and bodies—and people’s souls. The fruits you lusted for with all your heart have gone! All the luxury and flashiness have been destroyed, never to return! The sellers of these things, who got rich from her, will stand at a distance, for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning, and saying, “Oh no! The great city used to wear fine linen, purple and scarlet! She glittered with gold, precious stones and pearls! Such great wealth—in a single hour, ruined!” All the ship masters, passengers, sailors and everyone making his living from the sea stood at a distance and cried out when they saw the smoke as she burned, “What city was like the great city?” And they threw dust on their heads as they wept and mourned, saying, “Oh no! The great city! The abundance of her wealth made all the ship owners rich! In a single hour she is ruined!” Rejoice over her, heaven! Rejoice, people of God, emissaries and prophets! For in judging her, God has vindicated you. Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a great millstone, and hurled it into the sea, saying, “With violence like this will the great city Bavel be hurled down, never to be found again! “The sound of harpists and musicians, flute-players and trumpeters will never again be heard in you. No worker of any trade will ever again be found in you, the sound of a mill will never again be heard in you, the light of a lamp will never again shine in you, the voice of bridegroom and bride will never again be heard in you. “For your businessmen were the most powerful on earth, all the nations were deceived by your magic spell. “In her was found the blood of prophets and of God’s people, indeed, of all who have ever been slaughtered on earth!\u0026#34;\nIntroduction As we have mentioned, we need to view chapters 17 and 18 as a single unit. Babylon is here portrayed as a harlot, enticing the people. Babylon is distinct from the Beast or its heads. We will see that God is going to directly intervene to destroy the commercial system of Babylon; whereas, in chapter 17, He used the men who had used and abused the harlot but then turned on her to destroy the religious or political system (Rev 17:16).\nAs a recap, many see the seven heads and 10 horns as the 1st century Roman emperors, but this is problematic. We are told the 7th head “is not yet come” (Rev 17:10). Of the 10 horns, Rev 17:14 says they have not yet received authority. This makes speculation on the horns somewhat futile, except to say they come in the spirit of the horns of Daniel 8 and 11.\nSince kingdoms are often spoken of as “mountains”, it is possible that the seven heads are distinct empires, versus leaders of the same empire. Thus, one possible fit might be:\nFive …","date":1657238400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658354633,"objectID":"311f4ecf49340182cc4d07dfdd447ab6","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/rev18/","publishdate":"2022-07-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/rev18/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Babylon is Fallen!

Video\nRevelation 19 After these things, I heard what sounded like the roar of a huge crowd in heaven, shouting, “Hallelujah! The victory, the glory, the power of our God! For his judgments are true and just. He has judged the great whore who corrupted the earth with her whoring. He has taken vengeance on her who has the blood of his servants on her hands.” And a second time, they said, “Hallelujah! Her smoke goes up forever and ever!” The twenty-four elders and the four living beings fell down and worshipped God, sitting on the throne, and said, “Amen! Hallelujah!” A voice went out from the throne, saying, “Praise our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, small and great!” Then I heard what sounded like the roar of a huge crowd, like the sound of rushing waters, like loud peals of thunder, saying, “halleluiah! Adonai, God of heaven’s armies, has begun his reign! “Let us rejoice and be glad! Let us give him the glory! For the time has come for the wedding of the Lamb, and his Bride has prepared herself— fine linen, bright and clean, has been given her to wear.” (“Fine linen” means the righteous deeds of God’s people.) The angel said to me, “Write: ‘How blessed are those who have been invited to the wedding feast of the Lamb!’ \u0026#34; Then he added, “These are God’s very words.” I fell at his feet to worship him, but he said, “Don’t do that! I’m only a fellow servant with you and your brothers who have the testimony of Yeshua. Worship God! For the testimony of Yeshua is the Spirit of prophecy.” Next, I saw heaven opened, and there before me was a white horse. Sitting on it was the one called Faithful and True, and it is in righteousness that he passes judgment and goes to battle. His eyes were like a fiery flame, and on his head were many royal crowns. And he had a name written which no one knew but himself. He was wearing a robe that had been soaked in blood, and the name by which he is called is, “THE WORD OF GOD.” The armies of heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and pure, were following him on white horses. And out of his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down nations—“He will rule them with a staff of iron.” It is he who treads the winepress from which flows the wine of the furious rage of Adonai, God of heaven’s armies. And on his robe and on his thigh, he has a name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS. Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out in a loud voice to all the birds that fly about in mid-heaven, “Come, gather together for the great feast God is giving, to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of generals, the flesh of important men, the flesh of horses and their riders and the flesh of all kinds of people, free and slave, small and great!” I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to do battle with the rider of the horse and his army. But the beast was taken captive and with it the false prophet who, in its presence, had done the miracles which he had used to deceive those who had received the mark of the beast and those who had worshipped his image. The beast and the false prophet were both thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur. The rest were killed with the sword that goes out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.\nParable of the wedding feast and wedding clothes – Matthew 22:1-14 Mat 22:1-14 And again Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying, [2] “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son, [3] and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come. [4] Again he sent other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “See, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.”’ [5] But they paid no attention and went off, one to his farm, another to his business, [6] while the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them.

After that, he has to be set free for a little while. Then I saw thrones, and those seated there received authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for testifying about Yeshua and proclaiming the Word of God, also those who had not worshipped the beast or its image and had not received the mark on their foreheads and on their hands. They came to life and ruled with the Messiah for a thousand years. (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were over.) This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is anyone who has a part in the first resurrection; over him, the second death has no power. On the contrary, they will be cohanim of God and of the Messiah, and they will rule with him for the thousand years.\nWhen the thousand years are over, the Adversary will be set free from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for the battle. Their number is countless as the sand on the seashore, and they came up over the breadth of the Land and surrounded the camp of God’s people and the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and consumed them. The Adversary who had deceived them was hurled into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.\nNext, I saw a great white throne and the One sitting on it. Earth and heaven fled from his presence, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, both great and small, standing in front of the throne. Books were opened, and another book was opened, the Book of Life, and the dead were judged from what was written in the books, according to what they had done. The sea gave up the dead in it, and Death and Sh’ol gave up the dead in them, and they were judged, each according to what he had done. Then Death and Sh’ol were hurled into the lake of fire. This is the second death—the lake of fire. Anyone whose name was not found written in the Book of Life was hurled into the lake of fire.\nPro tip: you want to ensure your name is found in the Book of Life! The Millennium: Eschatology Review Here we encounter the Millennium, the thousand-year reign of Christ. Scholars over the centuries have debated whether this is literal or figurative. This debate results in the fundamental division in eschatology (the study of end times). Amillennialism Augustine (mid 4th Century) held that the Millennium was symbolic of the present age, not a literal time period. Amillennial is the term we give to this body of thought. In general, this view says that Jesus isn’t literally coming back to earth; He’s going to rule in our hearts as the church makes the world a better and better place. Amillennialism sees chapter 20 as summarizing all the events in the preceding chapters versus describing a distinct chronological period. Cynically, we can trace this belief to the fact that he lived during the time of Constantine when the church was married to the world (see our discussion on the letter to Pergamos). Since the church was the ruling and governing authority, it sure would have been politically incorrect to say that Jesus is coming back to rid the world of its evil rulers! Missler believes the two most significant shortcomings of the Protestant reformation are that first, they did not reassess the Church’s position concerning Israel (as discussed in Romans 9-11), and second, they did not reassess the Church’s position on Amillennialism. As a result, Calvin and Luther were staunch Amillennialists, and most protestants and Catholics hold an Amillennial theology. As a result, most denominations have very little use for the Book of Revelation, which is generally viewed as a protracted fable of good vs. evil. To them, the warnings in Rev 22:18-19 about not adding or removing anything from the book of prophecy might be especially chilling. A literal millennium In contrast, men who lived before Constantine, during times of persecution, such as Irenaeus and Justin Martyr, viewed Revelation as prophetic of events that will occur in the future. In other words, there will be a literal reign of Jesus, albeit with some debate over whether the “1000 years” is literal or figurative for “a long time.” We could call …","date":1658448000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658953041,"objectID":"5549d04b35fc7f31c7d9b56958a110c9","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/rev20/","publishdate":"2022-07-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/rev20/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Millennium - Revelation 20","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Read/hear the portions:\nSummary\nVideo\n","date":1628380800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661983304,"objectID":"9671f6e2cd401aa7b7fa10c3614ca5fc","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb4/28-pilgrimage-to-jerusalem/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb4/28-pilgrimage-to-jerusalem/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Pilgrimage to Jerusalem","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Revelation Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Revelation 21 – the Age to Come Introduction Rev 21:1 John sees a New Heaven and a New Earth Rev 21:2 The New Jerusalem Rev 21:3 the Word tabernacled among us Rev 21:4 Former things passed away Rev 21:5-6 All things new Rev 21:7 Promise to the overcomer Rev 21:8 Promise to the non-overcomers Rev 21:9-11 Jerusalem is the Bride of Christ Rev 21:12-13 Twelve gates/tribes Rev 21:14 Twelve foundations/apostles Rev 21:15 Taking measurements Rev 21:16-17 12,000 stadia 144 cubits Rev 21:18-20 Wall of precious stones Rev 21:21-22 Pearly gates and streets of gold Rev 21:23-25 “I am the light of the World” Rev 21:26 The nations will be there Rev 21:27 Nothing unclean will be present Rev 22:1-3 – Restored Eden Irenaeus Conjecture – three levels of the New Jerusalem Videos\nPart I Part II Revelation 21 – the Age to Come Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the old heaven and the old earth had passed away, and the sea was no longer there. Also, I saw the holy city, New Yerushalayim, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared like a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. I heard a loud voice from the throne say, “See! God’s Sh’khinah is with mankind, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and he himself, God-with-them, will be their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. There will no longer be any death, and there will no longer be any mourning, crying, or pain; because the old order has passed away.” Then the One sitting on the throne said, “Look! I am making everything new!” Also, he said, “Write, ‘These words are true and trustworthy!’ \u0026#34; And he said to me, “It is done! I am the ‘A’ and the ‘Z,’ the Beginning and the End. To anyone thirsty, I will give water free of charge from the Fountain of Life. He who wins the victory will receive these things, and I will be his God, and he will be my son. But as for the cowardly, the untrustworthy, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those involved with the occult and with drugs, idol-worshippers, and all liars—their destiny is the lake burning with fire and sulfur, the second death.” One of the seven angels having the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues approached me and said, “Come! I will show you the Bride, the Wife of the Lamb.” He carried me off in the Spirit to the top of a great, high mountain and showed me the holy city, Yerushalayim, coming down out of heaven from God. It had the Sh’khinah of God so that its brilliance was like that of a priceless jewel, like a crystal-clear diamond. It had a great, high wall with twelve gates; at the gates were twelve angels and inscribed on the gates were the names of the twelve tribes of Isra’el. There were three gates to the east, three gates to the north, three gates to the south, and three gates to the west. The wall of the city was built on twelve foundation stones, and on these were the twelve names of the twelve emissaries of the Lamb. The angel speaking with me had a gold measuring rod with which to measure the city, its gates, and its wall. The city is laid out in a square, its length equal to its width. With his rod, he measured the city at 1,500 miles, with length, width, and height the same. He measured its wall at 216 feet by human standards of measurement, which the angel was using. The wall was made of diamond, and the city was of pure gold resembling pure glass. The foundations of the city wall were decorated with all kinds of precious stones—the first foundation stone was diamond, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh turquoise, and the twelfth amethyst. The twelve gates were twelve pearls, with each gate made of a single pearl. The city’s main street was pure gold, transparent as glass. I saw no Temple in the city, for Adonai, God of heaven’s armies, is its Temple, as is the Lamb. The city has no need for the sun or the moon to shine on it because God’s Sh’khinah gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb. The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it. Its gates will never close; they stay open all day because night will not exist there, and the honor and splendor of the nations will be brought into it. Nothing impure may enter it, nor anyone who does shameful things or lies; the only ones who may enter are those whose names are written in the Lamb’s Book of Life.\nIntroduction In the Old Testament and the Gospels, the messianic age (millennium, Kingdom of/from Heaven) and the age to come (new heaven/earth, eternity) are often blurred. The Jewish Sages have consistently interpreted Isaiah 64:4 as referring to the age to come. Isa 64:4 “From of old no one has heard or perceived by the ear, no eye has seen a God besides you, who acts for those who wait for him” (Isa 64:4). What is the age to come like? We can’t tell you!

Between the main street and the river was the Tree of Life producing twelve kinds of fruit, a different kind every month; and the leaves of the tree were for healing the nations— no longer will there be any curses. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his servants will worship him; they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. Night will no longer exist, so they will need neither the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun, because Adonai, God, will shine upon them. And they will reign as kings forever and ever. Then he said to me, “These words are true and trustworthy: Adonai, God of the spirits of the prophets, sent his angel to show his servants the things that must happen soon.” “Look! I am coming very soon. Blessed is the person who obeys the words of the prophecy written in this book!” Then I, Yochanan, the one hearing and seeing these things, when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel showing them to me. But he said to me, “Don’t do that! I am only a fellow-servant with you and your brothers, the prophets and the people who obey the words in this book. Worship God!” Then he said to me, “Don’t seal up the words of the prophecy in this book, because the time of their fulfillment is near. “Whoever keeps acting wickedly, let him go on acting wickedly; whoever is filthy, let him go on being made filthy. “Also, whoever is righteous, let him go on doing what is righteous; and whoever is holy, let him go on being made holy.” “Pay attention!” [says Yeshua,] “I am coming soon, and my rewards are with me to give to each person according to what he has done. I am the ‘A’ and the ‘Z,’ the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.” How blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they have the right to eat from the Tree of Life and go through the gates into the city! Outside are the homosexuals, those involved with the occult and with drugs, the sexually immoral, murderers, idol-worshippers, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood. “I, Yeshua, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the Messianic communities. I am the Root and Offspring of David, the bright Morning Star. The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come!’ Let anyone who hears say, ‘Come!’ And let anyone who is thirsty come—let anyone who wishes, take the water of life free of charge.” I warn everyone hearing the words of the prophecy in this book that if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues written in this book. And if anyone takes anything away from the words in the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the Tree of Life and the holy city, as described in this book. “The one who is testifying to these things says, ‘Yes, I am coming soon!’ \u0026#34; Amen! Come, Lord Yeshua! May the grace of the Lord Yeshua be with all!\nRev 22:1 Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city;\nOur tour of the New Jerusalem continues from chapter 22.\nThis river actually started flowing at the other end of the Bible\nGen 2:10 A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers. This is a river flowing out of Jerusalem as seen by Ezekiel in the Messianic Temple. Notice the trees on one side and on the other.\nEze 47:1-8 Then he brought me back to the door of the temple, and behold, water was issuing from below the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east). The water was flowing down from below the south end of the threshold of the temple, south of the altar. [2] Then he brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around on the outside to the outer gate that faces toward the east; and behold, the water was trickling out on the south side. [3] Going on eastward with a measuring line in his hand, the man measured a thousand cubits, and then led me through the water, and it was ankle-deep. [4] Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water, and it was knee-deep. Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water, and it was waist-deep. [5] Again he measured a thousand, and it was a river that I could not pass through, for the water had risen. It was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be passed through. [6] And he said to me, “Son of man, have you seen this?” Then he led me back to the bank of the river. [7] As I went back, I saw on the bank of the river very many trees on the one side and on the other.

Keep the commandments All these I have kept Jesus Loved Him Sell all to have treasure in heaven The eye of a needle Who then can be saved? Left everything Inherit eternal life The parable of the workers Up to Jerusalem to suffer Sit at right and left Drink My Cup The ten disciples grumble Study Questions Summary\nJesus receives a question from a group of Pharisees regarding divorce. There were two groups of thought in the early 1st Century. The prevailing view was that divorce was permissible for any justification the husband had. The minority view was that it was only permissible for matters of sexual indiscretion. Jesus responds, generally agreeing with the minority view. His response startles the disciples who exclaim “it is better not to marry”. Jesus responds that in the absence of some physical malformation, one could elect to remain celibate for the sake of the kingdom. The section concludes with the disciples trying keep Jesus safe from crowds, which resulted in preventing little children from accessing Jesus. Jesus corrects the disciples’ thinking and says “let the children come to Me.”\nNext, A rich, young ruler asks Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life. Jesus says to keep the commandments, sell everything, and follow Him. The man went away sad for he had great wealth. Jesus says it is only through God that a rich man can enter the Kingdom. He then tells His disciples that their sacrifices for the Kingdom will be rewarded. Jesus then tells the parable of the hired workers where the owner pays workers who only worked about an hour the same as those who worked all day, causing the later group to grumble. Jesus again predicts his demise at Jerusalem and says the disciples will also drink his Cup of suffering.\nVideos\nPart I: Matthew 19:1-15 | Mark 10:1-16 | Luke 18:15-17\nPart II: Matthew 19:16-20:28 | Mark 10:17-45 | Luke 18:18-34\nIntroduction ACTS 17:11 (The Bereans) received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.\nIn this episode, we’re going to see that as a society, that culture had strayed a bit from God’s original intent. Moreover, they fully believed they were interpreting the Bible faithfully regarding permissible situations for divorce. Jesus is not just going to redirect them back to the Hebrew Bible, not just the Torah, not just Genesis, but Genesis chapter 1 shows God’s intent for marriage. This is why Acts 17:11 must be first and foremost in our study. It’s what Jesus did.\nMany of the topics are probably familiar to us (divorce, and the man who is told to sell everything). Let’s not let our familiarity be an excuse to not ask questions.\nChuck Missler used to say that the greatest obstacle to truth was the assumption you already have it. Missler also used to say, “where two people agree one is redundant.” these are familiar passages with familiar Protestant interpretations that tend to be repeated from one commentator to the next. As usual, the commentators I am using for this series bring added clarity based on their study of the first century legal and cultural backgrounds.\nThere is value in legitimate academic inquiry and applying Acts 17:11.\nNo condemnation\nAlso, of course, this is a sensitive topic, as many families are affected by divorce or are single parents.\nPerhaps some of us realize we haven’t acted according to the Biblical model for marriage. Or we were a relatively innocent victim of a partner who acted unbiblically. Or maybe there was a legitimate reason for our predicament other than our own sexual misconduct.\nAnother good memory verse is Romans 8:1.\nThere is now, therefore, no condemnation for those who are in Jesus the Messiah.\nWhile these words on divorce may pinch and the practical effects of divorce can’t be minimized, because of who Jesus is and everything he has done on behalf of sinners, you should not feel condemned as long as you are living in unison with Him.\nGeography Jesus has now left the fertile Jezreel and Harod valleys and has most likely crossed the Jordan to make His way down the East Bank towards Jericho. This area, south of the cities of the Decapolis, was Jewish. The terrain is such that water is more plentiful from the numerous brooks on the east side that feed the Jordan. This area is the ancient Gilead, where the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and ½ of Manasseh settled. And we use settled literally and figuratively. They literally settled here (in the sense of settlers) because the land was pleasing to the eye and excellent for raising livestock (which is true). They settled figuratively (in the sense of compromising; settling for less) because God wanted them to Enter and possess the land on the WEST side of the Jordan in the Land of Israel.

In Luke, Jesus also gives the double-parable of the Minas (Pounds) and the King’s Return.\nThe lesson begins with Jesus passing through Jericho on His way up to Jerusalem for the Passover. What Jesus knew, and what we, the readers, know, but what the disciples and others at the scene did not know is that this would be the final stop of His earthly ministry. The most tumultuous and historically significant week in all of human history was about to begin, but first Jesus continues His mission to seek and save the lost sheep of Israel.\nVideo\nGeography Matthew 20 Mark 10 Luke 18 29. As they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him. 46. And they came to Jericho. And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd… 35. As he drew near Jericho… Notes:1 2\nThe fact that Matthew and Mark say they were leaving Jericho, while Luke says they were drawing near Jericho need not concern us. Dr. Bolen writes, “it is apparent that Jesus was leaving the population center of Jericho (as recorded in Matthew) and entering the area of the Herodian city (as recorded in Luke).”3\nThis lesson takes place in and around the city of Jericho. Jericho is only about 15 miles from Jerusalem, but they couldn’t be more opposite in many ways.\nJericho lies deep in the Jordan Rift Valley, around 900 feet below sea level. Compare this to Jerusalem, high in the Judean hills at about 2500 feet above sea level4. In Jericho, freshwater is plentiful from the many springs. It is known as the “city of palms” because it is very much an oasis in the desert. Jerusalem’s only source of freshwater, the Gihon Spring, can only provide water for a few thousand people per year. Jericho commands the central east-west approach to Jerusalem, making it strategically important. The Jordan was relatively easy to cross near Jericho. This factor contributed to the wealth of Zacchaeus, the tax collector who was able to tax people coming and going. Despite having tremendous religious importance, Jerusalem is neither strategic nor wealthy. More Jericho Background Empires from the Persians to the Romans used Jericho as an administrative center. Alexander the Great had a private estate here. Mark Antony gave Jericho to Cleopatra as a gift. As we noted last time, Herod the Great had a palace here, which would still have been in use as Jesus made His way through the city. Much like he did with Jerusalem, Herod expanded his “footprint” in the city with several public works, military buildings, a hippodrome/theatre complex to entertain the masses, and of course, his lavish private palace.\nIn Israel’s history, we know that Jericho is significant for being the first town Joshua and the Israelites could capture using a unique battle plan. Of significance for us is the town of Gilgal. This is where God made the Israelites stop, get circumcised (a very odd thing to do before a battle!), sanctify themselves, and celebrate Passover (Joshua 5:1-12).\nGoing back even further, archeologists have unearthed artifacts that date to ~8000 BCE in the new stone age period – that’s 6000 years before Abraham. Historians believe Jericho is the oldest, continuously inhabited city in the world.\nThe setting here is a little over a week before Passover. Crowds are beginning to swell. The beginning of the narrow Ascent of Adummim would have represented a bottleneck, with people backing into Jericho. Additionally, primarily, but perhaps not exclusively due to Jesus, the expectation grew for a Messianic deliverer. Such hope is always higher around Passover, as the feast recalls Israel’s miraculous deliverance from oppressive Egypt. Those who realized God sent Jesus had every reason to think a similar redemption was at hand. Blind Bartimaeus Mat 20:29-34 Mar 10:46-52 Luk 18:35-43 Matthew 20 Mark 10 Luke 18 29. As they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him. 30. And behold, two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!” 31. The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be silent, but they cried out all the more, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!” 46. And they came to Jericho. And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the roadside. 47. And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, …","date":1642464000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661983304,"objectID":"2d51f811d09ddc255af04051347e8347","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb4/38-zacchaeus-and-bartimaeus/","publishdate":"2022-01-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb4/38-zacchaeus-and-bartimaeus/","section":"commentary","summary":"Jesus heals blind Bartimaeus, restores previously corrupt Zacchaeus, and gives us two challenging parables.","tags":["Luke 18","Matthew 20","Mark 10"],"title":"38.

The next seven days are a roller coaster of emotions, ending on the highest peak of all, the Resurrection.\nLesson 39 will be in two parts. Part I will review the Ascent of Adummim, which connects Jericho to Jerusalem. We’ll meet up with Jesus and the recently resurrected Lazarus in Bethany, look at how Jesus procures a donkey for his entry into Jerusalem, and examine the crowd’s reaction as they welcomed Jesus.\nVideo\nIntroduction: The Final Week Begins A note about the “Final Week” – We are “only” in John chapters 11 and 12, so the last ten chapters of John deal with this week and post-resurrection. Lancaster’s commentary is a five-volume set. Each volume has around 400 pages. The Triumphal entry occurs about ½ way into volume 4. In other words, even though it looks like we’re nearing the end from a timeline perspective, we have a LOT of Gospel still ahead of us. Our format will take another 14 lessons to cover the events in the eight calendar days between Palm Sunday and Resurrection Sunday.\nThis is undoubtedly the most influential and most personally significant week in all of history.\nLuke 19:28 And when he had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. The “these things” are the Minas and the King’s Returning parables we studied in Lesson 38.\nThis photo1 shows the ancient path that led the 18 miles (29 km) up from Jericho to Jerusalem. One always goes “up to Jerusalem.”\nThis chart comes from AD Riddle2 and shows Herod’s palace, Jericho, to Jerusalem. Presumably, the -720 is from the Herodian Palaces, west of the modern city and slightly higher. Modern Jericho’s height is listed at -864 feet, making it the lowest and the oldest continuously inhabited city on Earth. Today much of the Kidron valley has been filled in, so the elevation difference between that and Jerusalem is not as significant. Still, one had to be in excellent physical shape to make this trek. Today we do it in an air-conditioned bus with Wi-Fi.\nThe beginning of the Following the Messiah episode 8 has an excellent segment about this ascent. Watch through 8:55.\nWill he come to the feast? John 11:55-57 55 Now, the Passover of the Ioudaioi was at hand, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves. 56 They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, “What do you think? That he will not come to the feast at all?” 57 Now, the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, he should let them know so that they might arrest him. In the week leading up to Passover, Jerusalem would swell with Pilgrims. By some estimates, a population of perhaps a few hundred thousand could swell to 2-3 million. This helps explain several dynamics, most notably why the city’s leadership (both the Romans and the temple establishment) might be more on edge. It also makes locating one person in that crowd a non-trivial task.Ceremonial purification could take up to a week, especially if that person had come into contact with a corpse (Numbers 19). The Jewish Sages applied those same standards to any Jew living in a foreign country – gentile nations are inherently unclean. Remember this point when we get to Acts. This notion of ceremonial uncleanliness has a lot to do with the disciples’ attitudes and reticence concerning dining with non-Jews.\nThey were looking for Jesus, meaning the people were wondering whether He would claim his Messianic title. The Passover/Feast of Unleavened bread was compulsory, so it would be very unusual for Him not to show up, especially since He only had to travel a relatively short distance from Galilee.\nThe public didn’t realize that “the game’s afoot,” as Sherlock Holmes might say. The Jerusalem “deep state”\u0026#34; had already decreed that Jesus needed to be taken out.\nA Passover Seder If you get a chance to participate in a Passover Seder, you should take advantage of it. It is rich with Symbolism and Biblical history. Christians/Messianic Jews see additional symbolism that represents Jesus. For example, there are traditionally three pieces of Matzah wafers. The way it is baked, it has holes (like saltine crackers) and stripes. He was pierced for our iniquities, and his stripes heal us. Additionally, the 2nd of the three pieces is literally broken and “hidden” away until after the meal. Most Jews will tell you they don’t know why this is. Christians may have a better idea as this …","date":1643155200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661983304,"objectID":"32408812d0eb9488b2fb29cc603a3d89","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb5/39-triumphal-entry/","publishdate":"2022-01-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb5/39-triumphal-entry/","section":"commentary","summary":"In this lesson, we will examine the events of Palm Sunday as recorded in all four Gospels.","tags":["matthew 21"],"title":"Triumphal Entry","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Read/hear the portions:\nMatthew 21:12-21 Mark 11:12-26 Luke 19:45-58 ","date":1647993600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661983304,"objectID":"67456078905d4a7174974a9ef7799349","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb5/40-the-fig-tree/","publishdate":"2022-03-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb5/40-the-fig-tree/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Fig Tree","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Read/hear the portions:\nMark 11:27-12:37\nMatthew 21:23-22:46\nLuke 20:1-44\n","date":1647993600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661983304,"objectID":"806d3603dc92e75e7c6886e112aa473f","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb5/41-examine-the-lamb/","publishdate":"2022-03-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb5/41-examine-the-lamb/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Examining the Lamb","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":" Table of Contents Read/hear the portions:\nMatthew 23-1:39\nMark 12:38-44\nLuke 11:39-54;

Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed—He is worthy to open the scroll and its seven seals.” Gen 49:9-10; Isa 11:1,10; Hos 5:14 Rev 1:1; Rev 6:1 Rev 5:6 And in the midst of the throne and the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, I saw a Lamb standing, as having been slain—having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth. Isa 11:2; Zech 3:8-9; 4:10 Rev 4:5 Rev 5:7 He came and took the scroll from the right hand of the One seated on the throne. Rev 5:1; Rev 4:2,3 Rev 5:8 When He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense—which are the prayers of the kedoshim.

Joel 1:6 Psa 57:4; Joel 1:6 Rev 9:9 They had chests like iron breastplates; and the noise of their wings was like the noise of many horse-drawn chariots rushing into battle.

Masada means “fortress” in Hebrew. It was a palace/fortress Herod built for himself that ended up being used by Jewish rebels. After the Temple was burned in AD 70, the last 1000 holdouts fled here and made it their last stand. It holds the same symbolism as the Alamo does in Texas history. As the Romans were about to storm the top of the fortress, Josephus records that 10 men were tasked with killing their friend’s and family and burning/destroying anything of value. This was a better outcome in their view than being subject to Roman punishment. Finally the last man standing fell on his sword and when the Romans scaled the wall. We toured the historic site and learned a lot about 1st century life. As we exited, we walked down a path that parallels the Roman siege ramp, where the Romans breached the walls to find no booty to plunder.\nOn the drive from Masada, we learned about the geographic and geologic distinctions among the three words that get translated into English as “desert” or “wilderness.” Bmidbar, which is also the name of the book of Numbers in the Hebrew Bible is relatively fertile with shade and water available. The next type, Tsiya, has no food or shelter. What happened was villages sprang up about a day’s journey apart. The third type is Yeshimon. In this type there truly is nothing for days. Grumbling while in a Tsiyo or Yehimon would be more understandible, but the Israelites grumbled in the Bmidbar.\nKfar Hanokdim\nWe then traveled to a location called Kfar Hanokdim, which is a recreated Bedouin village and it is great example of Jews and Arabs working together. A Jewish man wanted to preserve the hospitality culture that he believed his people have lost (and how much more have WE lost it in the west?), so he approached a group of Arab bedouins who were still living that lifestyle about creating a living museum. My roommate Jeremy was selected to get 10 sheep from point A to point B about 50 feet away. It was virtually impossible. The lessons are certainly there for folks in leadership, but also it was a reminder that we are the stubborn sheep prone to wandering from our Shepherd. We did get to ride camels also. My camel is pictured below. I’m not sure how to interpret his facial expession.\nThis set up the main discussion on Abraham and Hospitality in Genesis 18-19. I recorded a brief video devo here:\nTel Arad\nBecause of time constraints, we were not able to get to Tel Arad, which was a location I had really wanted to see. One thing about traveling here is “blessed are the flexible.” In the bus, we received a fantastic teaching on the history and application of Arad. It was a place that had a nearly identical replica of the Jerusalem temple. The first problem is what’s another temple doing outside of Jerusalem and what are Jews doing worshipping there? It gets worse. On one pillar there was a dedication inscribed “to YHWH and his Asherah.” Asherah is a pagan fertility goddess. So we’re forced to ask “what in the world was going on here?” After we’re done pointing fingers at those dishonoring God, we can’t forget to look in the mirror. What are things we are worshipping alongside of God and bringing dishonor to Him? What stories do our purchases, video streaming queues, and internet histories tell?\nDead Sea Float\nWe ended the day with a dip in the Dead Sea - The salinity is about 10x that in oceans, which makes it impossible to sink. The mineral content means the water is also poisonous to drink. Many claim healing properties from the water and mud from the lake’s floor, so it’s a tradition to “mud up” before a dip. This reminded me of a contrast to living water versus deadly water. Again, back to our bank accounts and netflix queues: might we actually be ingesting poison water by the things we take in?\nHere is a brief video of me covered in mud talking about living water!\nSo it was a day filled with great lessons and an exponentially deeper understanding of God’s word.\nToday’s route from Google Maps (starting and ending at the Dead Sea public beach).\n","date":1675123200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675486072,"objectID":"56d611d71b8d99371ac9216f944bba76","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/sites/2023-blog/honor/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/sites/2023-blog/honor/","section":"sites","summary":"Dead Sea Devotional\nToday was another full day of activities centered around the Dead Sea and Judean wilderness. The general theme of the day was honor. We started with a walk along the strand of the Dead Sea as the sun was rising over the Moab mountains.","tags":[],"title":"#2 Wilderness and Negev - 1/12/23","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":"On Sunday mornings, we are leading a verse-by-verse study through the book of Genesis.

He wrote 13 letters, three of which were written to pastors and three of them have two letters. If we exclude those written to pastors and combine those who received two letters, we are left with (wait for it…) seven! According to Missler, thematically, Paul’s seven letters roughly (though not always perfectly) correspond with Jesus’ seven letters.\n# Revelation Paul Notes 1 Ephesus Ephesians First love/devotion not just doctrine 2 Smyrna Philipians Joy through suffering/endure persecution 3 Pergamos Corinthians The carnal church / married to the world / need to be pure 4 Thyatria Galatians A call out of religiousity/paganism 5 Sardis Romans Devotion to Orthodoxy but must be with love 6 Philadelphia Thessalonians Hope in second coming/missionary outreach 7 Laodicea Colossians Only a few miles apart, instructed to trade with each other, and there are Greek phrases that only occur in the New Testament in these two letters/ prosperous compromise Each Letter has a Matthew 13 Counterpart According to Missler, thematically, Jesus’ seven parables of the Kingdom roughly (though not always perfectly) correspond with Jesus’ seven letters.\n# Revelation Matthew 13 Notes 1 Ephesus Sower/Four Soils Tested those could be similar to the first three soils 2 Smyrna Tares/Wheat Adversary/enemy has infiltrated 3 Pergamos Mustard Seed We assume the mustard “tree” is bad (though this is debated). Generally, mustard plants only grow to a few feet tall - one in which the birds of the air (also typically evil) could lodge would mean it’s become a monstrosity. Pergamos became married to the world and followed the way of Balaam. They followed their flesh instead of God. 4 Thyatria Woman \u0026amp; Leaven Assuming the leaven is also used negatively in Matthew 13 (as leaven usually represents sin in the Old Testament), Jezebel contaminates the community just like the woman with leaven introduces sin into the batch 5 Sardis Treasure in Field The treasure is hidden. Most don’t see it. A few found worthy will be clothed in white 6 Philadelphia Pearl of Great Price Persevere through trials (a pearl grows in response to an introduce irritation;); sold out for Jesus 7 Laodicea Dragnet The judgment. Separation of Good and Bad (good are kept, bad are cast away/vomitted out) Layers of Interpretation Scholars have pointed out at least five different layers of interpretation/application of the Seven Letters.\n# Application Notes 1 Immediate, first century context, real fellowships with real struggles 2 Admonitory to all fellowships The things the seven fellowships struggled with are the same things all fellowships struggle with (but not to say that these are the ONLY things fellowships struggle with) 3 Personal - he who as an ear The things the seven fellowships struggled with are the same things you and I struggle with (though not exclusively) 4 Reflexive - did the fellowships see themselves the way Jesus saw them? Do we see ourselves the way He sees us? 5 History of the Gentile Church in order, from the Apostolic Church (Ephesus) in the first century, to the Apostate Church (Laodicea) today See discussion below. Seven letters as prophecy of the Gentile church Seeing the Seven Letters as a prophetic history of the gentile church is an interesting theory, though proponents must admit they are entirely speculating.\nWe can’t prove it from Scripture nor can we believe this interpretation would have remotely entered the minds of the original recipients. Also, it is potentially myopic as it entirely ignores the history of the Eastern church, including Russian/Greek/Armenian Orthodox, Arab Christian, Coptic, African and so forth.\nWe’ll present it here since the theory is very widely accepted, especially among Protestant commentators (all of whom naturally see themselves as being in “Philadelphia” not “Laodicea”\u0026#34;).\nThose who hold the belief that the seven letters spell out the history of the Gentile church would see the following:\n# Revelation Age Notes 1 …","date":1643414400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658435873,"objectID":"1d238ee412d81c68c01d6af01b582985","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/r04/a3-seven-letters-extra/","publishdate":"2022-01-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/r04/a3-seven-letters-extra/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Seven Letters Extra","type":"book"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":" Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.
