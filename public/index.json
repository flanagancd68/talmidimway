Our goal is to better understand the cultural, historic, geographic, and linguistic backgrounds of the Gospel’s original characters as well as those for whom the original manuscripts were written.\nThere are 54 lessons in the series that presents the Gospel stories in roughly chronological order. The lessons are grouped into four units:\n Early Ministry (1-11) Beginnings / Genealogies / Nazereth\n  Galilean Ministry (12-27) Capernaum / Sea of Galilee / Caeseara Philippi\n  Late Ministry (28-39) Judea / Samaria / Perea\n  Final Week and Resurrection (39-54) Palm Sunday / Temple Discourses / Last Supper / Gesthemane / Golgotha\n  Challenges with any Bible Study Our primary obstacle to a complete comprehension of the biblical texts is that we are separated by time an distance.\n TIME  These events happened 2000 years ago, and often referenced events that happened a thousand years before that\n DISTANCE  Israel is around 7000 nautical miles away from the central United States. For the most part has a very different geography and climate than what many of us are used to in North America. It can be surprising how big of a role geography can have on the Gospel narratives.\n  To bridge these gaps, Gospel Backgrounds synthesizes several published messianic Jewish, cultural and geographic commentaries/Bible atlases, as well as extra biblical documents and archaeology findings.\nActs 17:11  Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.^[Unless otherwise indicated, Scripture quotations are from The Holy Bible, English Standard Version. ESV® Text Edition: 2016. Copyright © 2001 by Crossway Bibles, a publishing ministry of Good News Publishers.]\n We will begin every study with Acts 17:11. This verse is paramount for two reasons:\n I, and every other commentator is human. I will of course make every attempt to be faithful and reliable, but we all have our biases, blind spots and faulty conclusions. For this I apologize in advance! The Biblical model is to “trust but verify” - it is up to you, the reader, to do your diligence and make sure facts and conclusions any commentator asserts are scriptural.  Key terms  Anachronism /Anachronistic Fallacy  Misappropriation of concepts and ideas in time\nFor example it is often assumed that Jesus, Paul and other gospel writers preached a new gentile religion.\nHistorically, the Jewish-Gentile split among followers of Jesus did not occur until the very late 1st century at the earliest, and more probably occurred gradually between the 2nd and 4th centuries. Until this time, what we know as “Christianity” was a sect within Judiasm.\nTherefore, since the split had not occurred at the time Jesus was speaking or Paul was writing, there is no way could have have had a new Gentile religion in view.\n Presuppositions  Our set of beliefs we bring with us as we read the text\n Eisegesis  Inserting concepts INTO the Text\nGenerally, we want to avoid, or at list limit, eisegesis. Since we are humans, with thoughts, emotions, presuppositions, and biases, it is nearly impossible to completely eliminate eisegesis as we read the biblical texts.\nThe best course of action is to realize and accept when we are inserting things into the text that are not written and perform Acts 17:11 due diligence on the applicable concept/conclusion.\n Exegesis  Extracting concepts FROM the Text\nExegesis is what we strive for. As with eisegesis, we must perform Acts 17:11 due diligence and make sure these concepts are consistent with the remainder of Scripture.\n  References used At the conclusion of each lesson a list of works cited will be published. I encourage anyone to never take my word for it but validate what I say. In fact, Chuck Missler used to paraphrase Acts 17:11 as, “don’t believe a word I tell you. Do your own homework and check it out for yourself.”\nI am specifically indebted to Daniel T. Lancaster whose five-volume “Chronicles of the Messiah” is the backbone for Gospel Backgrounds. The 54 lesson/episode format is from his series. Mr. Lancaster is the director of education for First Fruits of Zion, a messianic Jewish ministry.\nOther sources are as follows:\n Craig T.

We’re essentially going to take a look at significant events in the period between the Jewish Revolt of 66CE, including the destruction of the Jewish Temple in 70, through the mid-90s that resulted in John’s exile on Patmos, where he received the Revelation. Even if history wasn’t your best subject in school, I think you’ll find this helpful as we prepare to study Revelation.\nVideo\n  Introduction Other than Jesus predicting the temple’s destruction in Luke 21, all of this is drawn from extra-biblical sources. Much of it is verifiable from historical documents. Still, some of it is based on church tradition that was likely passed on orally before it was written down several centuries later.\nThe church father, Iraneus, was only one generation removed from John the Apostle. Iraneus in ecclesiastical history¸is the earliest source that tells us that John the Apostle wrote Revelation and did so from Patmos because the Roman Emperor Domitian exiled him.\nDomitian’s persecution turns out to be critically important if we are to put Revelation in context. The following is summarized mainly from Cargill’s Jerusalem the Holy City course1 and Lancaster’s series Apocalypse of John2 and Chronicles of the Apostles3.\n The years following Jesus\u0026#39; Resurrection and Ascension were a tumultuous time for Israel The governors that followed Pontius Pilate went from bad to worse, as did the Herods that took over for Antipas and Phillip, notably Agrippa I and Agrippa II With this came increased talk of rebellion and hopes for a Messianic deliverer In many Jew’s minds, the Messiah will deliver the people from captivity and establish a literal political kingdom, just like Moses did during the Exodus. Since Jesus didn’t do that, He couldn’t be the promised deliverer4. False messiahs were abundant. This led to what is known as the “First Jewish Revolt” in 66 CE.  The Jewish Revolt: Nero, Vespasian, and Josephus  In 66 CE, during the time of Emperor Nero (famous for his own persecutions and insanity), there was open rebellion; a Roman General named Vespasian (pictured at right) was sent with Roman Legions V, X, and XV to quash it. Josephus predicts greatness for Vespasian.  During one battle in the north of Israel, Vespasian captured a Jewish general named Yosef ben Mattiyahu, who later became known as Flavius Josephus. As he was about to be executed, Josephus said to Vespasian something along the lines of, “I’m not really a general. I’m a prophet, and one day you’re going to be the emperor.” Most Roman leaders were extraordinarily superstitious. Naturally, what this man said was pleasing to Vespasian’s ears; therefore, Josephus was allowed to live as an enslaved person. He authored two large volumes of Jewish history up to that point. In 69, while dealing with the Jewish rebellion, Vespasian was recalled to Rome, where he was indeed named emperor. Josephus also told Vespasian that amid all this Jewish messianic enthusiasm, it was Vespasian and his line who fulfilled the Jewish prophecies about the coming Messiah, not some Jewish person from the house of David.  After Vespasian became emperor, they took Jewish prophecies very seriously!   Josephus was still very much in the picture some 10-20 years later, when Vespasian’s son Domitian took over the Roman Empire. Josephus is viewed as a traitor to the Jews for his actions.  According to legend, a group of generals entered into a suicide pact rather than be captured. Josephus conveniently drew the proverbial last straw and was tasked with killing the last man and then himself. He obviously took another way when he presented himself to Vespasian.     Vespasian’s son Titus ultimately was successful in putting down the rebellion.  In 70, he besieged and sacked Jerusalem and destroyed the Temple stone-by-stone, just as Jesus had predicted. In 72, he rooted out the last Jewish holdouts at a place called Masada Those Jews who were not slaughtered were forced into exile The Jews would not have a homeland to call their own until 1948.    2nd Temple Destruction Fulfills Prophecy \rLuke 19:41-44 As He drew near and saw Jerusalem, He wept over her, 42. saying, \u0026#34;If only you had recognized this day the things that lead to shalom! But now they are hidden from your eyes. 43. For the days will come upon you when your enemies will surround you with barricades and hem you in on all sides. 44.

Summary\nWelcome to our series on the book of Revelation we call “Revelation Backgrounds.” In this introductory episode, we will provide an introduction to the book, some background into Jewish Apocalyptic literature, and we’ll provide what we see are Seven Keys to Interpretation. Revelation can be a complex book, but these keys will help assure we get started on the right path.\nVideo\n  “Revelation” (not “Revelations”)  In his course on Jerusalem, Dr. Cargill said, “the name of the book is ‘RevelationnnnnnNUH,\u0026#39;” he said to emphasize the singular1. He continued, “This is a pet peeve of mine. If you call it ‘RevelationS,’ it means you have never read the 1st verse, and I will flunk you.” Of course, we won’t flunk anybody, but this is a good reminder that the correct name of the book is not “Revelations,” but “Revelation.”  What is “Apocalyptic Literature”?  We often think of an apocalypse as some cataclysmic event involving worldwide destruction. From the Greek word apokalupsis, apocalypse means “revealing” or “unveiling.”  Specifically, we would say an unveiling of something not previously known, which wouldn’t be known were it not for divine intervention   In the days of John, there was a significant body of Jewish apocalyptic literature that he and much of his audience would have known2. The general flow of apocalyptic literature:  A person in a “spiritual state,” such as fasting and praying, is caught up to a realm usually unseen by mortals (possibly physically or possibly by way of a vision). He is given a tour, usually guided by an angel, where he sees heavenly worship services, God’s throne, and various hallowed chambers. He also sometimes sees “the war behind the war.”  In other words, when there is a physical war on earth, the person gets to witness a corresponding unseen spiritual warfare.   Then he gets to witness a final climactic battle between the forces of good and evil and resulting judgments. Often, the things the person with the vision sees are nearly impossible to put into words  The best he can do is use the best words he can, Because the human is trying to explain the inexplicable, we end up with the extreme symbolism, such as beasts doing strange things (Daniel 7:5-6) and objects that seem to defy the laws of physics (Ezekiel 1:16-20)     The general purpose of an Apocalypse is for God to reassure His people to remain faithful. Lancaster summarizes a biblical apocalypse like this:  “Although things on earth seem terribly unjust, with the righteous suffering and the wicked prospering, a day is coming where God will pour out his wrath upon the wicked and reward the righteous.” 3 In other words, “your faith and suffering are not in vain.”     The Apocalypse of Paul? Did you know Paul (or a man he knew) had an Apocalypse?\n 2 …","date":1643068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641940883,"objectID":"e4a4ce380be6a1e8cd87250b8f2933c2","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/revelation-introduction/","publishdate":"2022-01-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/revelation-introduction/","section":"commentary","summary":"Introduction to Revelation, Apocalyptic literature, Seven Keys to interpretation","tags":["John (Apostle)"],"title":"Revelation Introduction","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":"2. In his introduction John pictures Christ as the Word (Logos) John 1:1-18\n In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light. The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God. And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John bore witness about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”) For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father’s side, he has made him known.

John is often viewed as contrasting the correct way of Christianity with the incorrect way of Judaism, but this represents what is called an anachronistic fallacy, often shortened to “Anachronism” - misappropriation of concepts and ideas in time\nWe often see anachronisms in period piece movies. Someone will be wearing a digital watch in a movie set in the 18th century. at the 1955 enchantment under the sea dance, Marty McFly is playing a 1958 gibson guitar.\nIt is a challenge to restrain our own presuppositions, our set of established beliefs, when we read the Bible. It is natural to assume a biblical speaker to affirm our presuppositions in order to justify our positions.\nAn overarching anachronistic fallacy Many commentators commit is to take what is called “the parting of the ways” between Judaism and Christianity that occurred much later (2nd-4th centuries CE) and reading it back into this text in the 1st century.\nIn other words, since it had not occurred yet, there is absolutely no way John or any other biblical writer could have the split between Judaism and Christianity in view when they were writing.\nThis is called eisegesis - reading into the text. Modern conservative scholars would all agree that eisegesis is bad yet many of them do it almost automatically.\nWhat we strive for is EXEGESIS, understanding the text IN CONTEXT to extract what the author was saying. To do this, we must first realize the gospels are Jewish documents written within a historical context of 2nd Temple Judaism. The audience were Jewish Christ followers together with many non-Jews who had joined a Jewish sect..\nThe early church fathers affirmed John’s authorship of this Gospel strongly and unanimously. Some of the fathers claim to have personally known those who knew John in Ephesus in his later years, thus making a direct link to the tradition of Johannine authorship. The evangelist John is shown here with the symbol of an eagle, the one of the four living creatures which is traditionally associated with him (Ezekiel 1:5-10 and Revelation 4:6-7).\nJohn 1:1    John 1     1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.    Logos in the normal sense means “word or speech”. In this prologue, John uses it in the mystical sense. He alludes directly to the beginning of the Torah and the beginning of creation. He starts this with an intentional allusion to Genesis 1:1 “In the beginning”\nJohn 1:2-6    John 1     2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. 6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.    Recall the first act of Creation. “and God said Let there be Light, and there was light.”\nIn verse 4 John declares that this life had always been available through God’s word, which is the same word that he identifies with Jesus (IVP). In John 1:5, The divine light from the first day of creation shines once again into the dark world of man, signifying a new creation (COM)\nThere came a man, sent from God, whose name was John Excavations in the early 2000s revealed this cave west of Jerusalem near Ein Kerem. Archaeologist Shimon Gibson identified it with the ministry of John the Baptist on the basis of a stick-figure drawing of a man inside the cave. Gibson’s theory was published in The Cave of John the Baptist (Doubleday, 2004).\nFor responses, see that by James F. Strange (http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/reviews/the-cave-of-john-the-baptist/) and Todd Bolen (http://www.bibleplaces.com/cave-of-john-the-baptist/).\nSince the writing of the church father Origen (AD 185-254), the location of John’s baptizing at Bethany beyond the Jordan has been located at a point near the river opposite Jericho.\nJohn 1:7    John 1     7 He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him    Some scholars note that John has a “legal” feel. As you read John’s gospel, be on the lookout for the terms Witness, Testimony, and so on.\n Specifically, John is interested not only in establishing Jesus’ credentials, he is also interested in “convicting” the corrupt Jerusalem establishment on the grounds of usurption.\n Discovered in Cave 4 of Qumran in the early 1950s, this text contains five biblical verses that focused on the coming of the Messiah. This artifact was photographed in the Amman Museum.\nA few scholars suspect John may have been part of the Essene sect, but in any case he was definitely influenced by them.

The annunciation of the birth of the Baptist to Zacharias Luk 1:5-25\nIn the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abijah. And he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. And they were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord. But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years. Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty, according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense. And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth, for he will be great before the Lord. And he must not drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb. And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God, and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.” And Zechariah said to the angel, “How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.” And the angel answered him, “I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.” And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in the temple. And when he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he kept making signs to them and remained mute. And when his time of service was ended, he went to his home. After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she kept herself hidden, saying, “Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among people.”  5. The annunciation to the virgin Mary of the birth of Jesus Luk 1:26-38\nIn the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin’s name was Mary. And he came to her and said, “Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!” But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.” And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I am a virgin?” And the angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy—the Son of God. And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. For nothing will be impossible with God.” And Mary said, “Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.

The song of Elizabeth to Mary upon her visit Luk 1:39-45\nIn those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a town in Judah, and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, and she exclaimed with a loud cry, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.”  7. The Magnificat of Mary Luk 1:46-56\nAnd Mary said, “My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant. For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed; for he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name. And his mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation. He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts; he has brought down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of humble estate; he has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away empty. He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy, as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his offspring forever.” And Mary remained with her about three months and returned to her home.  8. The birth and childhood of the Baptist and his desert life Luk 1:57-80\nNow the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son. And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her. And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child. And they would have called him Zechariah after his father, but his mother answered, “No; he shall be called John.” And they said to her, “None of your relatives is called by this name.” And they made signs to his father, inquiring what he wanted him to be called. And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And they all wondered. And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God. And fear came on all their neighbors. And all these things were talked about through all the hill country of Judea, and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, “What then will this child be?” For the hand of the Lord was with him. And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying, “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has visited and redeemed his people and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David, as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old, that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us; to show the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant, the oath that he swore to our father Abraham, to grant us that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, might serve him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him all our days. And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways, to give knowledge of salvation to his people in the forgiveness of their sins, because of the tender mercy of our God, whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.” And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.

Apparently Joseph’s genealogy in Matthew and Mary’s in Luke Matthew 1\n The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.

Genealogies","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":"9. The annunciation to Joseph of the birth of Jesus Mat 1:18-25\nNow the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: “Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel” (which means, God with us). When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.  10. The birth of Jesus Luk 2:1-7\n In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria. And all went to be registered, each to his own town. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.  11. The praise of the angels and the homage of the shepherds Luk 2:8-20\nAnd in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear. And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.” And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!” When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.  12. The circumcision of Jesus Luk 2:21\nAnd at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.  13. The presentation in the temple with the homage of Simeon and Anna Luk 2:22-38\nAnd when the time came for their purification according to the Law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, “Every male who first opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord”) and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord, “a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.” Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ. And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the Law, he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said, “Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace, according to your word; for my eyes have seen your salvation that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel.” And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him. And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, “Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.” And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years, having lived with her …","date":1642032000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642102684,"objectID":"2cace6c7bdb0a12afb7607beb5a02f17","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/portions/gospels/gb1/gb04-portions/","publishdate":"2022-01-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/portions/gospels/gb1/gb04-portions/","section":"portions","summary":"Matthew 2:1-23 Luke 2:1-38","tags":["Matthew 2","Luke 2"],"title":"4 Nativity","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":"Table of Contents    Video Introduction      Video   Introduction Written commentary coming soon.\n","date":1615248000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641858843,"objectID":"edfac396f9699a2a3cafef307410c113","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb1/4a-nativity-part-i/","publishdate":"2021-03-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb1/4a-nativity-part-i/","section":"commentary","summary":"Table of Contents    Video Introduction      Video   Introduction Written commentary coming soon.","tags":["Luke 2","Matthew 1"],"title":"4a.

There were two groups of thought in the early 1st Century. The prevailing view was that divorce was permissible for any justification the husband had. The minority view was that it was only permissible for matters of sexual indiscretion. Jesus responds, generally agreeing with the minority view. His response startles the disciples who exclaim “it is better not to marry”. Jesus responds that in the absence of some physical malformation, one could elect to remain celibate for the sake of the kingdom. The section concludes with the disciples trying keep Jesus safe from crowds, which resulted in preventing little children from accessing Jesus. Jesus corrects the disciples\u0026#39; thinking and says “let the children come to Me.”\nVideo\n  Introduction  ACTS 17:11 (The Bereans) received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.\n In this episode, we’re going to see that as a society, that culture had strayed a bit from God’s original intent. Moreover, they fully believed they were interpreting the Bible faithfully regarding permissible situations for divorce. Jesus is not just going to redirect them back to the Hebrew Bible, not just the Torah, not just Genesis, but Genesis chapter 1 shows God’s intent for marriage. This is why Acts 17:11 must be first and foremost in our study. It’s what Jesus did.\nMany of the topics are probably familiar to us (divorce, and the man who is told to sell everything). Let’s not let our familiarity be an excuse to not ask questions.\nChuck Missler used to say that the greatest obstacle to truth was the assumption you already have it. Missler also used to say, “where two people agree one is redundant.” these are familiar passages with familiar Protestant interpretations that tend to be repeated from one commentator to the next. As usual, the commentators I am using for this series bring added clarity based on their study of the first century legal and cultural backgrounds.\nThere is value in legitimate academic inquiry and applying Acts 17:11.\nNo condemnation\nAlso, of course, this is a sensitive topic, as many families are affected by divorce or are single parents.\nPerhaps some of us realize we haven’t acted according to the Biblical model for marriage. Or we were a relatively innocent victim of a partner who acted unbiblically. Or maybe there was a legitimate reason for our predicament other than our own sexual misconduct.\nAnother good memory verse is Romans 8:1.\n There is now, therefore, no condemnation for those who are in Jesus the Messiah.\n While these words on divorce may pinch and the practical effects of divorce can’t be minimized, because of who Jesus is and everything he has done on behalf of sinners, you should not feel condemned as long as you are living in unison with Him.\nGeography Jesus has now left the fertile Jezreel and Harod valleys and has most likely crossed the Jordan to make His way down the East Bank towards Jericho. This area, south of the cities of the Decapolis, was Jewish. The terrain is such that water is more plentiful from the numerous brooks on the east side that feed the Jordan. This area is the ancient Gilead, where the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and ½ of Manasseh settled. And we use settled literally and figuratively. They literally settled here (in the sense of settlers) because the land was pleasing to the eye and excellent for raising livestock (which is true). They settled figuratively (in the sense of compromising; settling for less) because God wanted them to Enter and possess the land on the WEST side of the Jordan in the Land of Israel. The “Eastsiders,” as my friend Dan Stolebarger, calls them were usually the first people picked off by armies invading from the North.\nLet’s return to our narrative. At this stage, there is most likely a caravan forming of pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem for the Passover. Says Schlegel, “One cannot overstate both the excitement and tension that accompanied Jesus on His way to Jerusalem for the Passover festival. Every question, every word was loaded.” Many other events happened in this region. At Sukkoth, right above where Box 8 is, Jacob built a house and made booths for his cattle. This is where we get the name “sukkot” for the feast of booths, what we might know as the feast of Tabernacles in the fall. Gideon was also in this area in Judges 8 after the rout of the Midinettes. The most notable event was when Joshua led the Israelites …","date":1641513600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641579343,"objectID":"e93b7f0d3c5fbdcd4306b77bc188459f","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb3/beyond-the-jordan/","publishdate":"2022-01-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb3/beyond-the-jordan/","section":"commentary","summary":"Jesus receives a question regarding divorce, to which He responds with a narrow interpretation.

Jesus says to keep the commandments, sell everything, and follow Him. The man went away sad for he had great wealth. Jesus says it is only through God that a rich man can enter the Kingdom. He then tells His disciples that their sacrifices for the Kingdom will be rewarded. Jesus then tells the parable of the hired workers where the owner pays workers who only worked about an hour the same as those who worked all day, causing the later group to grumble. Jesus again predicts his demise at Jerusalem and says the disciples will also drink his Cup of suffering.\nVideo\n  Geography We are continuing the journey up to Jerusalem for the final Passover. Matthew 20 likely takes place somewhere near Jericho. As they passed through Jericho, there would have been agricultural fields and one of Herod the Great’s palaces.\n In Matthew 19, Jesus tells his talmidim that those who left their fields will receive their rewards. In Matthew 20, Jesus tells a parable about a man who owned a vineyard and needed workers. Later, he will tell His talmidim that once they get to Jerusalem, He will be turned over to the gentiles and the leaders.  It is not too much of a stretch to envision Jesus telling these stories as he passes near and references these geographic markers.\nThe Rich Young Ruler    Matthew 19 Mark 10 Luke 18     16 And behold, a man came up to him, saying, “Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?” 17 And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” 18 And a ruler asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”    Now we meet a man who tends to get the back of the hand from commentators. This treatment may be justified but perhaps not for the typical reasons offered. Let’s see if we can dig deeper.\nFirst, let’s accentuate the positives:\n Note the man RAN to meet Jesus and showed a high degree of respect He assumed the resurrection - we take this for granted, but it was not necessarily a decided issue back then (Pharisees vs. Sadducees) He likely asked other rabbis but was told he’s in the club because he’s Jewish.  _Potentially, something about this answer didn’t satisfy him.   He was a diligent Bible student and attempted to be obedient to the commands Most importantly, he CAME TO JESUS!  However, when he asks, “What must I do?”, this is our first “tell” that something is off is here.\nWe will learn in a couple of verses that the man was well-versed in the Torah, yet, as Lancaster puts it, “The man had concluded that the words of the Bible we’re not adequate to assure him of the resurrection.”\nWhy do you call me good?    Matthew 19 Mark 10 Luke 18     17 And he said to him, “Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. 18 And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. 19 And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.     What is behind Jesus\u0026#39; initial reaction to being called “good”?  He could be trying to get the young man to see that Jesus = God. Perhaps the man’s assuming Jesus had some special secret is the underlying motive by Jesus’ adverse reaction to calling him “good.“ Perhaps Jesus is saying, “Do not assume I have something to add to what God has already said.” In Hebrew, the phrase would be HaTov הַטּוֹב, “the good” or “the good one”. This is one of the Hebrew names for God.  Observant Jews do not pronounce the Covenant Holy Name of God (the “Tetragramaton” - four letters) out of respect.  They typically will say “Adonai” (Lord) if in a religious setting They will say “HaShem” (the Name), or another name like “HaTov” if in a less formal context. There is no recorded instance of Jesus using the Covenantal Name of God, but there are MANY examples where He uses a circumlocution, like He does here with “HaTov” I recommend gentile Christians follow Jesus\u0026#39; lead and use a name other than the Tetragramaton when referencing God the Father.        Keep the commandments    Matthew 19 Mark 10 Luke 18     17 If you would enter life, keep the commandments.” 18 He said to him, “Which ones?” 19 You know the commandments: 20 You know the commandments     “Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and mine ordinances; which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am Adonai” (Lev 18:5, ASV).\n  Jesus enhances and clarifies the Torah, but He does add to or subtract from it. Jesus here gives roughly the same answer Abraham gave in Luke 16. “They have Moses and the prophets.“ In other words, the Bible is sufficient and contains the words for eternal life. In Mark and Luke, Jesus is …","date":1641859200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641940883,"objectID":"b338540596998a514cc5b87a7a3b6d25","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb3/37b-beyond-the-jordan-ii/","publishdate":"2022-01-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb3/37b-beyond-the-jordan-ii/","section":"commentary","summary":"The rich, young ruler and the difficult response from Jesus.

In Luke, Jesus also gives the double-parable of the Minas (Pounds) and the King’s Return.\nThe lesson begins with Jesus passing through Jericho on His way up to Jerusalem for the Passover. What Jesus knew, and what we, the readers, know, but what the disciples and others at the scene did not know is that this would be the final stop of His earthly ministry. The most tumultuous and historically significant week in all of human history was about to begin, but first Jesus continues His mission to seek and save the lost sheep of Israel.\nVideo\n  Geography    Matthew 20 Mark 10 Luke 18     29. As they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him. 46. And they came to Jericho. And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd… 35. As he drew near Jericho…    Notes:1 2\nThe fact that Matthew and Mark say they were leaving Jericho, while Luke says they were drawing near Jericho need not concern us. Dr. Bolen writes, “it is apparent that Jesus was leaving the population center of Jericho (as recorded in Matthew) and entering the area of the Herodian city (as recorded in Luke).”3\nThis lesson takes place in and around the city of Jericho. Jericho is only about 15 miles from Jerusalem, but they couldn’t be more opposite in many ways.\n Jericho lies deep in the Jordan Rift Valley, around 900 feet below sea level.  Compare this to Jerusalem, high in the Judean hills at about 2500 feet above sea level4.   In Jericho, freshwater is plentiful from the many springs. It is known as the “city of palms” because it is very much an oasis in the desert.  Jerusalem’s only source of freshwater, the Gihon Spring, can only provide water for a few thousand people per year.   Jericho commands the central east-west approach to Jerusalem, making it strategically important.  The Jordan was relatively easy to cross near Jericho. This factor contributed to the wealth of Zacchaeus, the tax collector who was able to tax people coming and going. Despite having tremendous religious importance, Jerusalem is neither strategic nor wealthy.     More Jericho Background Empires from the Persians to the Romans used Jericho as an administrative center. Alexander the Great had a private estate here. Mark Antony gave Jericho to Cleopatra as a gift. As we noted last time, Herod the Great had a palace here, which would still have been in use as Jesus made His way through the city. Much like he did with Jerusalem, Herod expanded his “footprint” in the city with several public works, military buildings, a hippodrome/theatre complex to entertain the masses, and of course, his lavish private palace.\nIn Israel’s history, we know that Jericho is significant for being the first town Joshua and the Israelites could capture using a unique battle plan. Of significance for us is the town of Gilgal. This is where God made the Israelites stop, get circumcised (a very odd thing to do before a battle!), sanctify themselves, and celebrate Passover (Joshua 5:1-12).\nGoing back even further, archeologists have unearthed artifacts that date to ~8000 BCE in the new stone age period – that’s 6000 years before Abraham. Historians believe Jericho is the oldest, continuously inhabited city in the world.\n\r   The setting here is a little over a week before Passover. Crowds are beginning to swell. The beginning of the narrow Ascent of Adummim would have represented a bottleneck, with people backing into Jericho. Additionally, primarily, but perhaps not exclusively due to Jesus, the expectation grew for a Messianic deliverer. Such hope is always higher around Passover, as the feast recalls Israel’s miraculous deliverance from oppressive Egypt. Those who realized God sent Jesus had every reason to think a similar redemption was at hand.  Blind Bartimaeus  Mat 20:29-34 Mar 10:46-52 Luk 18:35-43     Matthew 20 Mark 10 Luke 18     29.

Revelation can be a complex book, but these keys will help assure we get started on the right path.\nWhile many commentators focus on what Revelation may mean to us living in the 21st Century, very few Protestant commentators take the time to understand the historical, first-century context. Revelation, as it turns out, is the most Jewish book in the New Testament. There are over 800 allusions to the Old Testament in the book’s 404 verses. The reasons many people struggle with the book is because we ignore its Jewishness.\nWe have developed “Seven Keys to Interpretation,” which we will discuss in the lesson.\n Follow the “Talmidim Way” - We want to learn to walk in the dust of Yeshua our Rabbi just as His original Talmidim, His disciples such as John did. Be open to the Spirit’s leading - Understanding what God wants us to learn is way more important that making sure others know our beliefs Be a Berean - Check everything out against scripture. If our interpretation doesn’t fit, it might be something we need to discard. Understand the intended audience - They were Jewish, or if they were gentiles, they were worshipping in a Jewish setting, which would have almost nothing in common with our western protestant churches today Revelation is a Jewish Book - For every verse in Revelation there is a 2:1 ratio of Old Testament illusions. If we try to understand Revelation without this background, we’ll be lost. With it, we’ll be much better off Be suspicious if an interpretation does not fit the original context - that is to say, if it could not have been within the realm of possibility for John or the original audience. This is not to say that the book can’t have multiple layers of interpretation, but for our historical and cultural approach, we want to start by making sure it’s something that would have made sense to the original audience. No fear allowed - While books and websites present the events of Revelation as something that should scare an unbeliever (and they probably should be scared), fear has no place in a believer’s heart.  We will also look at who wrote the book and some other details:\n Who wrote Revelation? John the Apostle. We don’t have 100% concrete proof, but the earliest and best evidence suggests it was none other than John, the author of the Gospel and three letters that bear his name. Where was it written? Patmos, which is an island some 35 miles off the coast of Turkey. Revelation 1:9 is our source for this. When was it written? Most conservative scholars land on 90-95 of the Common Era. Iraneus is the earliest source for this information. He was a disciple of Polycarp, who was a disciple of John. Iraneus states John received the relevation during the time of Emperor Domitian. How was Revelation given? Signs and Patterns! Revelation 1:1 contains the Greek word σημαίνω, which literally means “rendered into signs.” Every sign in the Bible points to something. Every sign in Revelation points to a verse (sometimes more than one) in the Old Testament. The pattern of the number seven is also quite conspicuous. Sevens are everywhere in Revelation. Since sevens are also conspicuous throughout the entire Bible, this is often seen as the “fingerprints of the Holy Spirit.” To whom was Revelation written? The seven messianic congregations in Asia Minor.. We are told this in Revelation 1:4. Note that although your Bible may say “seven churches,” the “church” either as a building or an organization did not exist when Revelation was given. We need to avoid what is called an anachronistic fallacy. See the lesson detail for more information. Why was Revelation written? The Hope of HIS RETURN and the Restoration of all things!

In Luke, Jesus also gives the double-parable of the Minas (Pounds) and the King’s Return. The lesson begins with Jesus passing through Jericho on His way up to Jerusalem for the Passover, where we are presented with two potential textual problems.\n Matthew says they were leaving Jericho, while Mark/Luke says they drew near to Jericho. Matthew says there were two beggars, while Mark/Luke list only one.  Both tensions are easily reconciled and need not distract us from the core teachings of the passage. There are several lessons for us with the healing of Bartimaeus.\nLuke alone tells the story of Zacchaeus, the repentant tax collector. Zacchaeus would have been extremely wealthy, but mainstream Jewish society viewed tax collectors as outcasts. To his credit, he wanted to see Jesus, and, as it turns out, Jesus wanted to see him. Zacchaeus was likely less than five feet tall, so he decided to climb a Sycamore tree to get a better view. Jesus notices the man in the tree, then says He “must” stay with him. Apparently, without any prompting from Jesus, Zacchaeus pledges to give half his goods to the poor. To the extent he defrauded anyone (which he did), he promised to repay with 4x damages. Jesus tells him, “Today salvation has come.” Jesus chose to honor an outcast, and he repented.\nLuke concludes this section with Jesus telling (but not explaining) two parables. Both fall into the category of “Journey parables.” With these parables in Luke 19, Luke makes it a point to tell us that Jesus told the parables “BECAUSE they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.” So whatever interpretation and application we come up with, it must connect somehow to the fact that (as we, the readers, know) the Messianic Kingdom did NOT appear immediately.\nWhat is curious about these parables is that Jesus deliberately compares the King-on-a-journey to the hated and wicked Herod Archelaus. Archelaus was so bad even the Romans got rid of him. So, the reader is presented with a curious question: if Jesus is allegorically speaking of Himself as the King in the parables, why would He so obviously compare Himself to the wicked Archelaus?\nThe video and lesson detail will explore some plausible interpretations and applications of these parables, including one that we might say goes against the grain of our typical expectations. We’ll don our “Acts 17:11 thinking caps” to work through these.\nThe lesson concludes with Luke writing, “when He had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.” In the next lesson, we will examine the Triumphal Entry, which is the first of the most significant seven days in all human history.\nRead/hear the portions window.ESV_CROSSREF_OPTIONS = {\rbody_background_color: \u0026#39;D7E5F0\u0026#39;, header_font_size: 10, body_font_size: 14, footer_font_size: 8, body_font_family: \u0026#39;Times\u0026#39; };\r  Matthew 20:29-34 Mark 10:46-52 Luke 18:35-19:38 (Primary)  Watch the video   Study the context  Click to read the complete Gospel Backgrounds lesson   ","date":1642636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642085878,"objectID":"7ee39e341789de6b5ab7e9ce5758375a","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/post/38-zaccheaus-and-bartimaus/","publishdate":"2022-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/38-zaccheaus-and-bartimaus/","section":"post","summary":"This lesson is titled “Zacchaeus and Bartimaeus” because of the healings, one physical and one spiritual of Blind Bartimaeus and Zacchaeus, the wealthy tax collector.

We often think that the young man has a “works righteousness” mindset - in other words, if a person has enough good deeds, he or she will merit eternal salvation. This is true to some degree, but notice Jesus\u0026#39; answer.\nHe doesn’t say “to get eternal life, all you need to do is accept Me into your heart.” In response to the immediate question, Jesus says first “keep the commandments”. Then when pressed further, He says, “one thing you lack: sell everything, give it to the poor, then follow Me.”\nNote that Jesus doesn’t rebuke the young man about being self-righteous, nor does Jesus correct the man’s errant theology. The man had a heart issue, not a head issue. There is a lot more going on with this exchange than it may first appear. We will take a peek under the hood to get at some of the lessons for our lives.\nThe exchange befuddles the disciples. They “remind” Jesus that they HAVE left everything and followed their Rabbi as His talmidim. Jesus assures them that their sacrifices will not go unrewarded.\nMatthew 20 begins with one of my favorite parables, the parable of the workers. A man needs workers for his vineyard. He finds some early in the day, but also at various points throughout the day, including at the “11th hour” right before the work is to end.\nWhen the work is done, the owner calls the workers from last to first and, to the surprise of those hired early, everyone is paid a denarious, a full day’s wage. Those hired early in the day gripe that this is unfair. Is is right that someone who did 1/12 of the work get paid the same as those who did a full day’s work? The owner replies that the first group agreed to the wage, and besides what He does with his money is his business and no one else’s.\nThe parable is rich with meaning and has several practical and spiritual applications. We will discuss a few of these in the lesson.\nThe section concludes with Jesus receiving a request from James and John to sit at Jesus\u0026#39; right and left hands during the millennial kingdom, which is often portrayed as a great banquet. Instead of rebuking their pride, Jesus explains what it means to sit by his side and “drink His cup”. This act of presumption, naturally, irks the other ten disciples. Jesus explains that our mission as disciples is not to be serve but to serve.\nRead/Listen to the portions window.ESV_CROSSREF_OPTIONS = {\rbody_background_color: \u0026#39;D7E5F0\u0026#39;, header_font_size: 10, body_font_size: 14, footer_font_size: 8, body_font_family: \u0026#39;Times\u0026#39; };\r  Matthew 19:16-20:28 Mark 10:17-45 Luke 18:18-34  Watch the video   Study the context  Click to read the complete Gospel Backgrounds lesson   ","date":1642032000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642085878,"objectID":"8ab4011f933f247aa89a4884bc3db3a0","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/post/beyond-the-jordan-part-ii/","publishdate":"2022-01-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/beyond-the-jordan-part-ii/","section":"post","summary":"This is part II of the Gospel Backgrounds lesson titled, “Beyond the Jordan.”\nTo begin the lesson, Jesus receives a question from a “rich, young ruler” about what must be done to inherit eternal life.","tags":[],"title":"Beyond the Jordan Part II","type":"post"},{"authors":["Chris Flanagan"],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":"Gospel Backgrounds Lesson 37 is titled “Beyond the Jordan.” We will do this in two parts.\nAfter leaving the Harod Valley [#7 on the map], Jesus makes His way to the Jordan, just south of where it exits the Sea of Galilee. The north-south path along the river in this vicinity was along the eastern shore, which the Gospel writers call “Judea beyond the Jordan.” [8]\nJesus will engage a group of inquisitive (but not necessarily trecharous) Pharisees who want to know the Master’s position on divorce. As it is today, divorce was a critical and controversial topic because of its impact on family and society. The Pharisees themselves were divided on when divorce was permissible. The majority view held that a man could divorce his wife for any reason, including not liking her cooking or even finding another woman more attractive. The minority view held that the Torah had in view sexual misconduct as the only permissible reason. Jesus sided with the minority. The disciples are so taken-aback by Jesus\u0026#39; response that they exclaim “in that case, it is better not to marry!”\nJesus also teaches about the role of children and we will understand what it means to “become like a child” in order to enter heaven.\nVideo\n   Click to read the complete Gospel Backgrounds commentary   ","date":1641427200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641482613,"objectID":"972a6c0053758a2fd3e7d6aff47b6b86","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/post/across-the-jordan/","publishdate":"2022-01-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/across-the-jordan/","section":"post","summary":"Gospel Backgrounds Lesson 37 is titled “Beyond the Jordan.” We will do this in two parts.\nAfter leaving the Harod Valley [#7 on the map], Jesus makes His way to the Jordan, just south of where it exits the Sea of Galilee.","tags":["Gospels","Jordan","Divorce","Children","Mark 10","Matthew 19","Matthew 20","Luke 18"],"title":"Beyond the Jordan Part I ","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":"Gospel Backgrounds Lesson 36 is titled “Between Samaria and Galilee,” and is taken from Luke 17:11 where we are told Jesus is making his way up to Jerusalem for His final passover and passes between Samaria and Galilee.
