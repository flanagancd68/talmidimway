Our goal is to better understand the cultural, historic, geographic, and linguistic backgrounds of the Gospel’s original characters as well as those for whom the original manuscripts were written.\nThere are 54 lessons in the series that presents the Gospel stories in roughly chronological order. The lessons are grouped into four units:\n Early Ministry (1-11) Beginnings / Genealogies / Nazereth\n  Galilean Ministry (12-27) Capernaum / Sea of Galilee / Caeseara Philippi\n  Late Ministry (28-39) Judea / Samaria / Perea\n  Final Week and Resurrection (39-54) Palm Sunday / Temple Discourses / Last Supper / Gesthemane / Golgotha\n  Challenges with any Bible Study Our primary obstacle to a complete comprehension of the biblical texts is that we are separated by time an distance.\n TIME  These events happened 2000 years ago, and often referenced events that happened a thousand years before that\n DISTANCE  Israel is around 7000 nautical miles away from the central United States. For the most part has a very different geography and climate than what many of us are used to in North America. It can be surprising how big of a role geography can have on the Gospel narratives.\n  To bridge these gaps, Gospel Backgrounds synthesizes several published messianic Jewish, cultural and geographic commentaries/Bible atlases, as well as extra biblical documents and archaeology findings.\nActs 17:11  Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.^[Unless otherwise indicated, Scripture quotations are from The Holy Bible, English Standard Version. ESV® Text Edition: 2016. Copyright © 2001 by Crossway Bibles, a publishing ministry of Good News Publishers.]\n We will begin every study with Acts 17:11. This verse is paramount for two reasons:\n I, and every other commentator is human. I will of course make every attempt to be faithful and reliable, but we all have our biases, blind spots and faulty conclusions. For this I apologize in advance! The Biblical model is to “trust but verify” - it is up to you, the reader, to do your diligence and make sure facts and conclusions any commentator asserts are scriptural.  Key terms  Anachronism /Anachronistic Fallacy  Misappropriation of concepts and ideas in time\nFor example it is often assumed that Jesus, Paul and other gospel writers preached a new gentile religion.\nHistorically, the Jewish-Gentile split among followers of Jesus did not occur until the very late 1st century at the earliest, and more probably occurred gradually between the 2nd and 4th centuries. Until this time, what we know as “Christianity” was a sect within Judiasm.\nTherefore, since the split had not occurred at the time Jesus was speaking or Paul was writing, there is no way could have have had a new Gentile religion in view.\n Presuppositions  Our set of beliefs we bring with us as we read the text\n Eisegesis  Inserting concepts INTO the Text\nGenerally, we want to avoid, or at list limit, eisegesis. Since we are humans, with thoughts, emotions, presuppositions, and biases, it is nearly impossible to completely eliminate eisegesis as we read the biblical texts.\nThe best course of action is to realize and accept when we are inserting things into the text that are not written and perform Acts 17:11 due diligence on the applicable concept/conclusion.\n Exegesis  Extracting concepts FROM the Text\nExegesis is what we strive for. As with eisegesis, we must perform Acts 17:11 due diligence and make sure these concepts are consistent with the remainder of Scripture.\n  References used At the conclusion of each lesson a list of works cited will be published. I encourage anyone to never take my word for it but validate what I say. In fact, Chuck Missler used to paraphrase Acts 17:11 as, “don’t believe a word I tell you. Do your own homework and check it out for yourself.”\nI am specifically indebted to Daniel T. Lancaster whose five-volume “Chronicles of the Messiah” is the backbone for Gospel Backgrounds. The 54 lesson/episode format is from his series. Mr. Lancaster is the director of education for First Fruits of Zion, a messianic Jewish ministry.\nOther sources are as follows:\n Craig T.

Summary\nWelcome to our series on the book of Revelation we call “Revelation Backgrounds.” In this introductory episode, we will provide an introduction to the book, some background into Jewish Apocalyptic literature, and we’ll provide what we see are Seven Keys to Interpretation. Revelation can be a complex book, but these keys will help assure we get started on the right path.\nVideo\n  “Revelation” (not “Revelations”)  In his course on Jerusalem, Dr. Cargill said, “the name of the book is ‘RevelationnnnnnNUH,’” he said to emphasize the singular1. He continued, “This is a pet peeve of mine. If you call it ‘RevelationS,’ it means you have never read the 1st verse, and I will flunk you.” Of course, we won’t flunk anybody, but this is a good reminder that the correct name of the book is not “Revelations,” but “Revelation.”  What is “Apocalyptic Literature”?  We often think of an apocalypse as some cataclysmic event involving worldwide destruction. From the Greek word apokalupsis, apocalypse means “revealing” or “unveiling.”  Specifically, we would say an unveiling of something not previously known, which wouldn’t be known were it not for divine intervention   In the days of John, there was a significant body of Jewish apocalyptic literature that he and much of his audience would have known2. The general flow of apocalyptic literature:  A person in a “spiritual state,” such as fasting and praying, is caught up to a realm usually unseen by mortals (possibly physically or possibly by way of a vision). He is given a tour, usually guided by an angel, where he sees heavenly worship services, God’s throne, and various hallowed chambers. He also sometimes sees “the war behind the war.”  In other words, when there is a physical war on earth, the person gets to witness a corresponding unseen spiritual warfare.   Then he gets to witness a final climactic battle between the forces of good and evil and resulting judgments. Often, the things the person with the vision sees are nearly impossible to put into words  The best he can do is use the best words he can, Because the human is trying to explain the inexplicable, we end up with the extreme symbolism, such as beasts doing strange things (Daniel 7:5-6) and objects that seem to defy the laws of physics (Ezekiel 1:16-20)     The general purpose of an Apocalypse is for God to reassure His people to remain faithful. Lancaster summarizes a biblical apocalypse like this:  “Although things on earth seem terribly unjust, with the righteous suffering and the wicked prospering, a day is coming where God will pour out his wrath upon the wicked and reward the righteous.” 3 In other words, “your faith and suffering are not in vain.”     The Apocalypse of Paul? Did you know Paul (or a man he knew) had an Apocalypse?\n 2 …","date":1643068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641940883,"objectID":"e4a4ce380be6a1e8cd87250b8f2933c2","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/revelation-introduction/","publishdate":"2022-01-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/revelation-introduction/","section":"commentary","summary":"Introduction to Revelation, Apocalyptic literature, Seven Keys to interpretation","tags":["John (Apostle)"],"title":"1.

John is often viewed as contrasting the correct way of Christianity with the incorrect way of Judaism, but this represents what is called an anachronistic fallacy, often shortened to “Anachronism” - misappropriation of concepts and ideas in time\nWe often see anachronisms in period piece movies. Someone will be wearing a digital watch in a movie set in the 18th century. at the 1955 enchantment under the sea dance, Marty McFly is playing a 1958 gibson guitar.\nIt is a challenge to restrain our own presuppositions, our set of established beliefs, when we read the Bible. It is natural to assume a biblical speaker to affirm our presuppositions in order to justify our positions.\nAn overarching anachronistic fallacy Many commentators commit is to take what is called “the parting of the ways” between Judaism and Christianity that occurred much later (2nd-4th centuries CE) and reading it back into this text in the 1st century.\nIn other words, since it had not occurred yet, there is absolutely no way John or any other biblical writer could have the split between Judaism and Christianity in view when they were writing.\nThis is called eisegesis - reading into the text. Modern conservative scholars would all agree that eisegesis is bad yet many of them do it almost automatically.\nWhat we strive for is EXEGESIS, understanding the text IN CONTEXT to extract what the author was saying. To do this, we must first realize the gospels are Jewish documents written within a historical context of 2nd Temple Judaism. The audience were Jewish Christ followers together with many non-Jews who had joined a Jewish sect..\nThe early church fathers affirmed John’s authorship of this Gospel strongly and unanimously. Some of the fathers claim to have personally known those who knew John in Ephesus in his later years, thus making a direct link to the tradition of Johannine authorship. The evangelist John is shown here with the symbol of an eagle, the one of the four living creatures which is traditionally associated with him (Ezekiel 1:5-10 and Revelation 4:6-7).\nJohn 1:1    John 1     1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.    Logos in the normal sense means “word or speech”. In this prologue, John uses it in the mystical sense. He alludes directly to the beginning of the Torah and the beginning of creation. He starts this with an intentional allusion to Genesis 1:1 “In the beginning”\nJohn 1:2-6    John 1     2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. 6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.    Recall the first act of Creation. “and God said Let there be Light, and there was light.”\nIn verse 4 John declares that this life had always been available through God’s word, which is the same word that he identifies with Jesus (IVP). In John 1:5, The divine light from the first day of creation shines once again into the dark world of man, signifying a new creation (COM)\nThere came a man, sent from God, whose name was John Excavations in the early 2000s revealed this cave west of Jerusalem near Ein Kerem. Archaeologist Shimon Gibson identified it with the ministry of John the Baptist on the basis of a stick-figure drawing of a man inside the cave. Gibson’s theory was published in The Cave of John the Baptist (Doubleday, 2004).\nFor responses, see that by James F. Strange (http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/reviews/the-cave-of-john-the-baptist/) and Todd Bolen (http://www.bibleplaces.com/cave-of-john-the-baptist/).\nSince the writing of the church father Origen (AD 185-254), the location of John’s baptizing at Bethany beyond the Jordan has been located at a point near the river opposite Jericho.\nJohn 1:7    John 1     7 He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him    Some scholars note that John has a “legal” feel. As you read John’s gospel, be on the lookout for the terms Witness, Testimony, and so on.\n Specifically, John is interested not only in establishing Jesus’ credentials, he is also interested in “convicting” the corrupt Jerusalem establishment on the grounds of usurption.\n Discovered in Cave 4 of Qumran in the early 1950s, this text contains five biblical verses that focused on the coming of the Messiah. This artifact was photographed in the Amman Museum.\nA few scholars suspect John may have been part of the Essene sect, but in any case he was definitely influenced by them.

We’re essentially going to take a look at significant events in the period between the Jewish Revolt of 66CE, including the destruction of the Jewish Temple in 70, through the mid-90s that resulted in John’s exile on Patmos, where he received the Revelation. Even if history wasn’t your best subject in school, I think you’ll find this helpful as we prepare to study Revelation.\nVideo\n  Introduction Other than Jesus predicting the temple’s destruction in Luke 21, all of this is drawn from extra-biblical sources. Much of it is verifiable from historical documents. Still, some of it is based on church tradition that was likely passed on orally before it was written down several centuries later.\nThe church father, Iraneus, was only one generation removed from John the Apostle. Iraneus in ecclesiastical history¸is the earliest source that tells us that John the Apostle wrote Revelation and did so from Patmos because the Roman Emperor Domitian exiled him.\nDomitian’s persecution turns out to be critically important if we are to put Revelation in context. The following is summarized mainly from Cargill’s Jerusalem the Holy City course1 and Lancaster’s series Apocalypse of John2 and Chronicles of the Apostles3.\n The years following Jesus’ Resurrection and Ascension were a tumultuous time for Israel The governors that followed Pontius Pilate went from bad to worse, as did the Herods that took over for Antipas and Phillip, notably Agrippa I and Agrippa II With this came increased talk of rebellion and hopes for a Messianic deliverer In many Jew’s minds, the Messiah will deliver the people from captivity and establish a literal political kingdom, just like Moses did during the Exodus. Since Jesus didn’t do that, He couldn’t be the promised deliverer4. False messiahs were abundant. This led to what is known as the “First Jewish Revolt” in 66 CE.  The Jewish Revolt: Nero, Vespasian, and Josephus  In 66 CE, during the time of Emperor Nero (famous for his own persecutions and insanity), there was open rebellion; a Roman General named Vespasian (pictured at right) was sent with Roman Legions V, X, and XV to quash it. Josephus predicts greatness for Vespasian.  During one battle in the north of Israel, Vespasian captured a Jewish general named Yosef ben Mattiyahu, who later became known as Flavius Josephus. As he was about to be executed, Josephus said to Vespasian something along the lines of, “I’m not really a general. I’m a prophet, and one day you’re going to be the emperor.” Most Roman leaders were extraordinarily superstitious. Naturally, what this man said was pleasing to Vespasian’s ears; therefore, Josephus was allowed to live as an enslaved person. He authored two large volumes of Jewish history up to that point. In 69, while dealing with the Jewish rebellion, Vespasian was recalled to Rome, where he was indeed named emperor. Josephus also told Vespasian that amid all this Jewish messianic enthusiasm, it was Vespasian and his line who fulfilled the Jewish prophecies about the coming Messiah, not some Jewish person from the house of David.  After Vespasian became emperor, they took Jewish prophecies very seriously!   Josephus was still very much in the picture some 10-20 years later, when Vespasian’s son Domitian took over the Roman Empire. Josephus is viewed as a traitor to the Jews for his actions.  According to legend, a group of generals entered into a suicide pact rather than be captured. Josephus conveniently drew the proverbial last straw and was tasked with killing the last man and then himself. He obviously took another way when he presented himself to Vespasian.     Vespasian’s son Titus ultimately was successful in putting down the rebellion.  In 70, he besieged and sacked Jerusalem and destroyed the Temple stone-by-stone, just as Jesus had predicted. In 72, he rooted out the last Jewish holdouts at a place called Masada Those Jews who were not slaughtered were forced into exile The Jews would not have a homeland to call their own until 1948.    2nd Temple Destruction Fulfills Prophecy  Luke 19:41-44 As He drew near and saw Jerusalem, He wept over her, 42. saying, \u0026#34;If only you had recognized this day the things that lead to shalom! But now they are hidden from your eyes. 43. For the days will come upon you when your enemies will surround you with barricades and hem you in on all sides. 44.

This is the revelation which God gave to Yeshua the Messiah, so that he could show his servants what must happen very soon. He communicated it by sending his angel to his servant Yochanan, 1:1 Daniel 2:28 but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream and the visions of your head as you lay in bed are these: 29 To you, O king, as you lay in bed came thoughts of what would be after this, and he who reveals mysteries made known to you what is to be.     Allusions and Cross-References  We believe your study of this amazing book will be greatly enhanced if you read and meditate on the allusions listed. A comprehensive listing for all 22 chapters, including cross-references from the Treasury of Scripture Knowledge, is in Appendix A1. As you hover over (or tap) on each verse, the text of the English Standard Version will appear. \n   This is the Revelation  We have several questions answered immediately in verse 1.  Who wrote: John Who is it for: servants of Yeshua (not for unbelievers) Who is it about: Yeshua When should we study: immediately for the time is near   As we noted in the introduction, this is one revelation, so the book’s name is Revelation, not “revelations.” John’s Hebrew name, Yochanan, means something like “blessed by God.” Although the original record we have is in Greek and John was multilingual, Jesus very likely communicated this in Hebrew, John’s primary language.  Interestingly, Hebrew words for “revelation” and “exile” are linguistically related.  גָלָה is the verb for “to reveal, uncover” and is pronounced “ga-LAH”; גָלוּת, “ga-LOOT,” is the word for exile.   Jewish apocryphal writings, of which Revelation is included, tend to occur when the people were exiled by God, living outside the land when they were vulnerable to abuses by the pagan nations. As we mentioned in the introduction, one of the purposes of Jewish apocalyptic literature was for God to communicate to His people that He is still in control. Although things seem unfair now, a day is coming when God will set everything straight. To help capture the “Jewishness” of the book, we will be using the Complete Jewish Bible (CJB) paraphrase translation.  No translation is perfect, and the CJB is not without problems. You can hover over any Bible reference and compare the English Standard Version (ESV). Often the King James Version does the best job at capturing the meaning of the Greek. …","date":1643932800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641940883,"objectID":"8248b500ba80a2e8adeb997ca3835484","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/2-greetings-rev-1-1-11/","publishdate":"2022-02-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/2-greetings-rev-1-1-11/","section":"commentary","summary":"John receives the vision and pronounces a blessing upon all who read and obey.

Summary\nVideo\n  Daniel 7 and 10 The so-called “Vision of the Risen Christ” in Revelation 1:12-18 has several similarities (and key differences) with Daniel 7 and Daniel 10. It is beneficial to read the Daniel passages before we begin a verse-by-verse study of the remainder of Revelation 1.\nIn the Daniel passages, focus on the depictions of the “Ancient of Days” and the “Son of Man” in Daniel 7:9-14, and then the description of the unnamed angel in Daniel 10:5-10.\nDaniel 7 (1) In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head as he lay in his bed. Then he wrote down the dream and told the sum of the matter. (2) Daniel declared, “I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea. (3) And four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another. (4) The first was like a lion and had eagles’ wings. Then as I looked its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and the mind of a man was given to it. (5) And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side. It had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, ‘Arise, devour much flesh.’ (6) After this I looked, and behold, another, like a leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back. And the beast had four heads, and dominion was given to it. (7) After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns. (8) I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.\n(9) “As I looked, thrones were placed, and the Ancient of Days took his seat; his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames; its wheels were burning fire. (10) A stream of fire issued and came out from before him; a thousand thousands served him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the court sat in judgment, and the books were opened. (11) “I looked then because of the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking. And as I looked, the beast was killed, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire. (12) As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time. (13) “I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. (14) And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed.

We will also review several approaches to application including three conjectures.\nVideo\n  Intro Our fifth lesson in Revelations backgrounds will introduce the seven letters in chapters 2-3. Each letter follows an intricate and nearly identical outline. Understanding this at the outset will help us as we seek to unpack each letter. Next, we will look at several application layers and the commonly taught “church age” conjecture. We will also look at the often confusing and misunderstood phrases, “the Nicolaitans,” “those who say they are Jews but are not,” and “the synagogue of Satan.” Since these phrases occur in multiple letters, we will deal with them upfront. Ultimately Scripture does not define these. We will strive to leverage what we ARE told from Scripture – and we do get some clues – with what was going on in that society at the time to make an educated guess that may be different from what is commonly taught. Acts 17:11 says, don’t take my word for it but test these theories to see whether these things could be so. As we mentioned in an earlier lesson, our job is not to tell you WHAT to think. It’s to get you TO think.\nThe Sevenfold Structure of Each Letter We will find that the letters follow a sequence of seven elements. 1. Name of the city (addressee), 2. An attribute of the Glorified Messiah from 1:12-20 (addresser), 3. Praise that usually begins with “I know…”, 4. Judgment, 5. Encouragement, 6. A promise to the overcomer, 7. “He who has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.”\nKeener notes: “Some scholars have compared the elements of the form to Old Testament and ancient Near Eastern covenant formulas; if they are correct, the prophecies here may act like the covenant lawsuits common in the Old Testament prophets (e.g., in Amos 2–4). They may also function analogously to a series of oracles against the nations common in the Old Testament prophets (e.g., Isaiah 13–23; Jer 46–51; Ezek 25–32; especially the eight brief oracles of Amos 1–2).”1 We examine each element in greater detail and describe more about the judgment aspect, as commentators often overlook this.\n1. Name of the City  (1) “To the angel of the Messianic Community in Ephesus, write: ‘Here is the message…\nThe first element is always addressed to the angel of the assembly at each of the cities. We’ve mentioned in previous lessons that there is scholarly debate as to whether the angel is supernatural or is a human messenger. For our purposes, it doesn’t matter as the body of each letter deals with the behaviors of the human body of believers.\nThe meaning of the city’s name often is revealing. For example, Ephesus means “darling” or “darling one,” yet this is the church that lost its first love, and the Greek word used is Agape, a completely devoted type of love.\nAs we go through each city in subsequent Revelation Background lessons, we will present some of the background history, enhancing our understanding of what God communicates to the fellowship. Keener writes, “Ancient cities were fiercely proud of their own history and culture and would be more sensitive to local allusions than most readers today would be.”2\n2. A specific attribute of Messiah  ‘Here is the message from the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven gold menorahs: \nThe second element is a specific attribute of the one who is sending the letter. The speaker is never identified as Jesus, but we’ll say it’s Jesus the Messiah in his risen and glorified form even though we know John received the revelation through an angel.\nThe attributes typically tie back to the description of this heavenly being in Revelation 1:12-20. There is one slight deviation in the letter to Philadelphia where He says He has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens.

Its location meant it could serve as an essential waypoint from Rome to the eastern provinces, either by sea or land. A network of Roman roads connected the seven messianic assemblies. They also eventually linked up with routes leading to Asia proper, including Israel, the Fertile Crescent, and Africa.\nDuring the Roman Empire, Ephesus was a significant harbor village. On the map inset, you can see estimations of the shoreline from 500 BCE to 60 CE to the present. The change was caused by dramatic silting from the Cayster River, making the modern harbor useless. The photo below the map shows the swampy area of the Roman port today. This photograph shows the Great Theater (with seating up to 25,000) with the street that led to the now silted harbor. Acts 19:21-41 describes a riot that occurred when devotees of Diana/Artemis said that Paul posed a clear and present danger to their way of life. The theater is where the riot took place.\nThe harbor street (shown in the center of the picture) would have been lined with shops on both sides.1 There was also a large “agora,” or marketplace adjacent. “This would have been the likeliest place…for Aquila, Priscilla, and Paul to have set up shop for their long stay in Ephesus.”2 DeSilva also notes the market “was a major note in the flow of goods from the East to Rome. Many of the cargoes listed in Rev 18:12-13 could be found arriving in Ephesus from the East for further transportation west.”3 We need to imagine how difficult it would have been to live life as a set-apart believer in a thoroughly pagan environment like Ephesus.\nEphesus secular history Scholars believe Hittites founded Ephesus in 1400 BCE. Archeologists have excavated remains of an early temple to a mother goddess, a Hittite fertility deity that later morphed into Diana/Artemis. If the name “Hittite” rings a bell, Uriah, one of David’s mighty men, was a Hittite. Uriah had a beautiful wife named Bathsheba.\nEphesus repeatedly picked the wrong side in the Peloponnesian, Persian, and Roman wars. Still, it became a favored city under Rome and competed with Pergamum (and Smyrna to a lesser extent) over which city was most favored by Rome.\nEphesus and Artemis The temple to Artemis/Diana was one of the famous “Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.” With a footprint of 220’ x 425’, It is four times larger than the Parthenon in Athens4. It was first built in the mid-6th century BCE atop previous temples dating to the 8th century (the time of King Hezekiah in Judah). Artemis, called Diana by the Romans, was the virgin goddess of the moon, fertility, and nature. Our “mother nature” myth likely comes from her. Artemis is the earth goddess, nurturing and fertile. As we can see in the photo,5 Artemis is depicted as multi-breasted (or multiple eggs, also a symbol of fertility). She can also be cruel, vindictive, and destructive.6\nLooking at the map above, we can see that the temple was situated about a mile outside the central Roman city. Bolen writes, \u0026#34; This makes sense, given Artemis’s identity as a goddess of the wilds.”7 Fertility rites involving temple prostitutes were shared, which Paul disrupted in the New Testament period. It appears to have been destroyed around 400 CE. Today not much remains of the site except for a conspicuous pillar.\nThis …","date":1645660800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641940883,"objectID":"2db5e721d2901b8f573b216b3e060820","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/ephesus/","publishdate":"2022-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/ephesus/","section":"commentary","summary":"Revelation 2:1-7 Letter to Ephesus","tags":[],"title":"Letter to Ephesus","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":"Table of Contents    Video Introduction      Video   Introduction Written commentary coming soon.\n","date":1619136000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641859225,"objectID":"2950cb0bf0d18526af659735f175985e","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb1/6-john-the-immerser/","publishdate":"2021-04-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb1/6-john-the-immerser/","section":"commentary","summary":"Table of Contents    Video Introduction      Video   Introduction Written commentary coming soon.","tags":["Luke 3","Matthew 3","Mark 1","John 1"],"title":"6.

He who wins the victory will not be hurt at all by the second death.” \u0026#39;    Smyrna Background Geography and History Like Ephesus, Smyrna was a deep harbor town. This resulted in economic prosperity, though Smyrna was never as commercially significant as Ephesus. The map below shows Smyrna’s location respective to Ephesus and Pergamum. It’s about 42 miles north of Ephesus. Like Ephesus, the harbor eventually became silted over and the modern shoreline is a few miles to the west.\nUnlike Ephesus, which tended to pick the wrong side during the great imperial battles of antiquity, Smyrna did not. In fact, they were steadfastly loyal to Rome. This was true long before Rome came to power. They built a temple to Roma, the deified personification of Rome in 195 BCE, when Smyrna was in Greek hands.1\nStrabo, the great geographer of antiquity, indicated that the ancient Smyrnans believed their city to be the birthplace of Homer and had what they called a Homerium: a temple to Homer and a statue. Strabo also said that Smyrna was “the most beautiful city in Ionia.”2\nThe modern Turkish city of Izmir sits atop where we believe ancient Smyrna is. This has significantly limited archaeological excavation. Because of this, we are unable to confirm any Jewish/Christian presence in the city at the time Revelation was written. However as scholars will point out, “absence of evidence, is not evidence of absence.” Bolen points out the modern city of Izmir, “has a long history of Jewish residents, evidenced by the number of synagogues in the area of the historic city…at one time there were nine synagogues located on a single street.”3\nOut of all the seven cities mentioned in Revelation, only Smyrna (Izmir) survives as a continuously inhabited city.4\nThe Roman Imperial Cult Like Ephesus, the culture of Smyrna was deeply seated in the worship of what is called the Roman Imperial Cult. They were described as “being loyal to Rome and its gods, even unto death.” This is one of those likely local allusions (or maybe a better word is a ‘pun’) Jesus makes in Rev 2:10, when He says, “Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.”\nWe see an example of this in an inscription to Hadrian found at Smyrna. The dedication describes Hadrian as “Olympian, Savior, and Founder.” (Ὀλυμπίωι σωτῆρι καὶ κτίστηι).”5 By calling him “Olympian,” they are saying Hadrian is equivalent to Zeus. It is no accident that they used words challenging the status of Jesus as Savior. Even though Hadrian would have been after the time John wrote (this dedication dates to 128 CE), this is still illustrative of the culture the believers in Smyrna found themselves. Even though after the fact, labeling Hadrian as “founder” is in opposition to Jesus calling Himself “the First and the Last.”\nEmperor worship was mandatory. The law required citizens to make an annual offering and acknowledge publicly that Caesar was supreme lord. They received a certificate that they had done so, after which they were permitted to worship whatever gods they wanted. As we have noted, ethnic Jews were in a protected class and exempted from this by law, but gentile believers were not. This led to significant tensions between Jews (both believing and non-believing) and Gentile followers of Yeshua, the Jewish Messiah, with the former group being called to publicly denounce the latter. The lack of “proper papers” showing this group refused to worship Caesar added to the pressure believers and those protecting them were under (remember in Nazi Germany, those who aided and …","date":1645833600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641940883,"objectID":"97b03bfbc6916089253ee9659a64fd85","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/smyrna/","publishdate":"2022-02-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/smyrna/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Letter to Smyrna","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":"Table of Contents    Video Introduction      Video   Introduction Written commentary coming soon.\n","date":1620432000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641859377,"objectID":"3c95a5704ec3d20037598e83f62d2581","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb1/7-immersion-and-temptation/","publishdate":"2021-05-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb1/7-immersion-and-temptation/","section":"commentary","summary":"Table of Contents    Video Introduction      Video   Introduction Written commentary coming soon.","tags":["Matthew 3","Mark 1","Luke 3","Luke 4"],"title":"7.

Archaeologists believe the city was founded in the third millennium BCE. The town likely owes its beginnings to geography, as there is a conspicuous hill 900 feet above the valley below. It was once thought to be impregnable. Later, Lysimachus, one of Alexander the Great’s four succeeding generals, built a military fortification on this hill called an acropolis. Lysimachus also built Ephesus, and the two cities would vie for power and favor throughout the Roman period. Ultimately Ephesus, with its harbor, became the economic power, while Pergamum became the religious center. Since religion and politics were one and the same, Pergamum became the Roman capital of Asia minor.1 The second photo shows a closer look at the acropolis with labels from Dr. Bolen. Note the theater with seating for 10,000 built into the hill. It is the steepest of all Roman theaters excavated in Turkey.\nThe library was massive by standards of the day with 200,000 volumes, barely second to the library at Alexandria, Egypt. Stiles notes that after relations with the Romans and Egyptians soured and the empire no longer had access to papyrus, Pergamum’s people developed parchment.\nEmperor Worship/Roman Imperial Cult Around 250 BCE, Bolen writes, “Pergamum became a leading cultural center, especially in art and science. The acropolis underwent a massive restoration, and the Aesculapian was founded.”2 Missler writes that Pergamum “became the center of the official religion of emperor worship. The first temple of this cult was erected at Pergamos in 27 BCE.”3 In his commentary, Missler also traces several pagan myths founded in Babylon that eventually were incorporated at Pergamum during the Greek period and eventually to Rome during the Roman period. As was common to all seven cities, numerous pagan statues, shrines, and temples were built in homage to the Roman Imperial Cult. It is also depicted on their coinage.\nAs discussed previously, this put the gentile believers in a difficult position. Emperor worship was compulsory unless you were Jewish. Although not explicitly stated, we can speculate that many in Pergamum went through the motions of the emperor worship procedures (compared to Smyrna, where they did not). Jewish believers and nonbelievers were still in an uncomfortable position, of course. The Torah prohibits graven images, such as the one on this coin and the many statutes erected around the town. Many probably simply got used to it; in other words, they compromised. The genuinely devout would have continued to be bothered by it. As we discussed in the Smyrna lesson, you don’t have to be beaten to feel beaten down. DeSilva notes, “Antagonism towards the Christian movement appears to have been particularly high (in Pergamum), resulting in the murder (whether as a result of official proceedings or back-alley action) of a Christian named Antipas.”4 This was life for the …","date":1646438400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641940883,"objectID":"56c706a85632a2290eb34064c3a402d5","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/pergamum/","publishdate":"2022-03-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/pergamum/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":["Pergamum"],"title":"Letter to Pergamum","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":"Table of Contents    Video Introduction      Video   Introduction Written commentary coming soon.\n","date":1620691200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641859647,"objectID":"f7ea8ac3f393f3f00a195ad9ef735727","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb1/8-the-first-sign/","publishdate":"2021-05-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb1/8-the-first-sign/","section":"commentary","summary":"Table of Contents    Video Introduction      Video   Introduction Written commentary coming soon.","tags":["John 1","John 2"],"title":"8.

And I know that you are doing more now than before. (20) But I have this against you: you continue to tolerate that Izevel woman, the one who claims to be a prophet, but is teaching and deceiving my servants to commit sexual sin and eat food that has been sacrificed to idols. (21) I gave her time to turn from her sin, but she doesn’t want to repent of her immorality. (22) So I am throwing her into a sickbed; and those who commit adultery with her I am throwing into great trouble unless they turn from the sins connected with what she does; (23) and I will strike her children dead! Then all the Messianic communities will know that I am the one who searches minds and hearts and that I will give to each of you what your deeds deserve. (24) But to the rest of you in Thyatira, to those who do not hold this teaching, who have not learned what some people call the ‘deep things’ of the Adversary, I say this: I am not loading you up with another burden; (25) only hold fast to what you have until I come. (26) To him who wins the victory and does what I want until the goal is reached, I will give him authority over the nations; (27) he will rule them with a staff of iron and dash them to pieces like pottery, (28) just as I have received authority from my Father. I will also give him the morning star. (29) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.” \u0026#39;      Thyatira Background Thyatira is located 42 miles inland on a flat plain. Its location was bad from a military perspective but good from a trade perspective. Thyatira was strategically located on a highway connecting it with Pergamum and Troas (and today Istanbul) to the north, Smyrna to the west, and Sardis to the south.\nThyatira is related to θυγάτηρ, thygater, or “daughter.” After Seleucus I (Nicator) took control of the city in 301 BCE, he named the location θυατειροις (Thyateirois) in honor of his daughter.1\nMany devotional (as opposed to scholarly) commentaries reflect that the name means “continual sacrifice,” but only one scholarly reference that I could identify confirmed this, and this author did so without providing any references supporting the Greek interpretation.2 I’m skeptical of this interpretation. It sounds more to me like Protestant commentators contrived these meanings as a dig towards Catholics to support the “Church Age Theory” linking Thyatira to the Catholic/Papal church and the Doctrine of the Mass. Despite differences Protestants may have with Catholic doctrine (and vice-versa), we must be devoted to the truth, not Protestant folklore. I will be glad to post a correction to this paragraph should I come across a hard source supporting one of these alternate names as a potential interpretation of the Koine Greek. Until this time, I would encourage readers to be equally skeptical. “Daughter” appears to be a straightforward Greek interpretation and is entirely consistent with the extra-biblical historical narrative. Remember Acts 17:11, which is our charge to accept the truth and reject falsehoods, no matter how much they may “fit” or how much we may wish they were true.\nWhat does have more scholarly support, though still disputed, is that a former name of the city was “Semiramis,” a mythical goddess common to multiple ancient cultures. Again, in what is likely to be a Protestant misunderstanding (taking a charitable view of it), a book written in 1853 puts forth the suggestion that Semiramis was the mother of Nimrod, the Bible’s first apostate, and they had an incestuous relationship resulting in Tammuz and the Babylonian pagan system which ultimately found their way into the Catholic Church’s practices. There is no historical record supporting the book’s claims, yet to this day, they are …","date":1646956800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641940883,"objectID":"059b628609794a5e3a3979ee6bd9334d","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/thyatira/","publishdate":"2022-03-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/thyatira/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":["Mt.

(6) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.” \u0026#39;    Sardis Background Sardis is about 17 miles south of Thyatira and 60 miles east of Smyrna.1\nThe founding of Sardis likely dates to before the time of Abraham (c 2000 BCE). It was the ancient capital of the Lydian empire. Its patron deity was the Goddess Cybele, which in Greco-Roman times became Artemis/Diana, who was also the patron deity of Ephesus. Cybele’s son was Midas, whom we may know as the one where everything he touched turned to gold. This is a great lesson in the need to think things through. Everything he touched, included things such as food. Before the Greek period, Sardis was rumored to have “gold-bearing sands.”2 Historically, it was an extremely wealthy city all the way through New Testament times.\nThe temple to Diana was the fourth largest Ionic-style temple existing in the ancient world.3 There were eight massive columns on each end with 20 columns on each side. One of these columns is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. For scale, note the people on the ground in the photo.4 At one point, prior to it being excavated by archaeologists, the entire temple was underground, with just the columns sticking up out of the ground.\nLike Pergamum, ancient Sardis sat atop a hill rising 1000 feet from the valley below.5 By appearances, it was impregnable. Geologically, the cliffs were predominately clay, which cracked and eroded. Egotistically, the citizens referred to their city as “Sardis the Impregnable,” so did little to guard.6 One tradition holds that in 549 BCE, Cyrus was approaching with his Persian army. Only one person was designated to watch the one entrance up the cliff and that person fell asleep and dropped his helmet partway down the cliff. The Persians saw the man and the path he took were able to follow that same path to victory. Then in 214 BCE, a nearly identical thing happened. A man was asleep at his post, this time allowing Antiochus I and his Seleucid Greeks to take over. The city was conquered three other times during that period (501, 334, and 322). In the New Testament times, the city was devastated by a severe earthquake in 17 CE. We could say that they had a name that they were impenetrable but were very much vulnerable. Jesus appears to be drawing on this history when He says, “wake up!”\nBurial place of Gog? Eight miles north of Sardis are dozens of these burial mounds (called tumulus) dating from the 8th-6th centuries BCE. This is the mound of Gyges, the first king of Lydia (687-652 BCE), thought by many to be the biblical Gog from Ezekiel 39-397. We will meet Gog again in Revelation 20:8. “and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea.”\nNew Testament Period In contrast to Thyatira, archeologists have been able to uncover many findings at Sardis. Most date from the 2nd century through the Byzantine period. Stiles reports that along a street where 27 shops have been excavated, 10 of these belonged to Christians, clearly indicating integration into mainstream society. This is in remarkable contrast to the previous four cities we have studied, where persecution was expected. The photo shows what archaeologists believe to be a paint shop.

(13) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.” \u0026#39;    Philadelphia Background The ancient city of Philadelphia lies under the modern city of Alasehir, Turkey. The abundance of seismic activity tied with the city’s history has created a chaotic situation in relation to excavations. There have been few inscriptions found and almost no significant excavations have been attempted. The remains of the Byzantine Church of St. John the Theologian, built around AD 600, are the most substantial archaeological remains currently visible.1 Massive pillars suggest the 6th-century church was enormous.2 Archaeologists have also found evidence of a stadium, only a part of which is visible today.\nPhiladelphia is about 25-30 miles southeast of Sardis; it had the nickname “Gateway to the East” because of its access to trade routes, including commanding a junction on a Roman Road between Laidocea and Pergamum.34 Through Philadelphia, “Hellenization” spread to the east. Hellenism sought to apply Greek manners and customs, first voluntarily, then forced. Missler sees this Hellenistic “missionary” activity as support for Philadelphia being a type of the missionary church age (1750-present).\nEumenes II, king of Pergamum, had a younger brother Attalus II, who reigned from 159-138 BC. The name means “lover of his brother” and refers to Attalus’s loyalty to his brother in refusing to overthrow him, even amidst encouragement from advisors to do so.5 In the same way, we believe the assembly of brothers and sisters in Philadelphia held fast in their loyalty to Jesus in the face of opposition.\nUnlike Sardis, possibly the oldest city among the seven, Philadelphia is the newest. The city’s growth was impeded by frequent earthquakes, including those in 17 CE that severely damaged Sardis.\nA possible local allusion in the Letter to Philadelphia is that the city’s name was changed twice in the 1st century. At one point, it was named Neo Caesarea after emperor Tiberius, and then to Flavia Philadelphia, after the wife of Vespasian.6 Philadelphia is the name that stuck.\nAll cities of this time would have had enforced pagan worship. Zeus Helios and Anaitis, a person God related to Cybele and later, Artemis, were the patron deities. Temples and coins also featured Zeus, Dionysus, Aphrodite, Asclepius, Cybele, and Nike.7 Wilson states enforcement of the required Roman oath may have been especially strict here.8 Dionysus was an essential deity as grape production was an important industry. See the vineyards in the photo.9 “Many religious festivals were held at the temple to Dionysus.”10 As a biblical type, wine is symbolic of marriage and celebration (cf. the Wedding at Cana), and by extension the Messianic Kingdom, also known as the marriage supper of the Lamb. There is a possible allusion to the vineyards of Philadelphia as being the church that will be ushered into the kingdom in the Age to Come.\nPhiladelphia is not attested to elsewhere in the New Testament. No remains of a synagogue have been found. Still, there was an …","date":1648166400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641940883,"objectID":"e6df07b856b70e4b6810c9b66db7f6eb","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/philadelphia/","publishdate":"2022-03-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/philadelphia/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Philadelphia","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":"Table of Contents    Video Introduction      Video   Introduction Written commentary coming soon.\n","date":1615680000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641860218,"objectID":"8848e5ab88932fc35186ff97c29566b2","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb1/11-pool-of-bethesda/","publishdate":"2021-03-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb1/11-pool-of-bethesda/","section":"commentary","summary":"Table of Contents    Video Introduction      Video   Introduction Written commentary coming soon.","tags":["John 5"],"title":"11.

(21) I will let him who wins the victory sit with me on my throne, just as I myself also won the victory and sat down with my Father on his throne. (22) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.” ’ \u0026#34;             Laodicea Background As you can see from the image above, Laodicea, Hierapolis, and Colossae were in very close proximity, and in terms of wealth and power, the cities formed the metroplex of their day. They are at the eastern end of the Meander River valley, with Miletus and Ephesus on the Western end of that valley. Therefore, it was a natural passageway to distribute goods to and from Ephesus. A second valley, the Lycus River valley, ran Northwest to Philadelphia or southeast to Syria. By the second century BCE, Laodicea became the wealthiest and most important of the three because it sat at the junction of these two valleys. The assembly in Laodicea was the furthest south and west of all the churches. After completing his circuit of bringing the letter to each of the seven assemblies (and likely others along the way), the human messenger would have likely returned to Ephesus.\nThe city was founded in the mid-200s BCE by Antiochus II, who named it after his wife, Laodice. Laodice combines the words for “the people” and “justice,”1 or “the people ruling.” 2 This is an interesting name because this is a church where God is on the outside knocking to get in. The Laodiceans were doing what was right in their own eyes. In terms of pronunciation, Greek would have a hard “c” (Lah-od-ik’-i-ah).\nFrom a worldly perspective, the city almost had it all. The photo is from the Sacred Agora, one of the many commerce centers of the city.3 Many of its supposed strengths will be referenced in Revelation.4 According to God, concerning the assembly of believers, they are not strengths at all but weaknesses.\n It was THE banking center of Asia with large stores of gold (and an adjunct industry of gold refiners)  The assembly thinks they are rich, but they are spiritually poor Jesus offers HIS gold   Textile manufacturing and distribution, primarily black wool  The assembly thinks they are clothed in righteousness, but they are naked Jesus offers HIS covering (white raiment versus black wool)   It was a medical center, specifical ophthalmology; Collyrium was an ingredient used in healing eye salves as well as cosmetics  The assembly thinks they have clear vision, but they are spiritually blind Jesus, the Great Physician, offers HIS remedy: the Holy Spirit   Also, entertainment was everywhere; it had a large stadium and multiple theaters  Unlike the actors and athletes who were adorned, the believers were wretched and pitiable   As with all cities, everything was dedicated to a false god  Though not stated directly, the conclusion, given the previous six letters. is that the Laodiceans comfortably co-mingled paganism with worship of Jesus Metaphorically and probably literally, they were dining at the table with false gods in pagan temples, which are the throne rooms of those gods Jesus invites the believers to dine with Him and Him alone in His throne room and His alone    In recent years, archeological work has uncovered many gates, buildings, pillars, inscriptions, and other findings, making it easy to visualize the city\u0026#39;s wealth and prominence.

(6) In front of the throne was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. In the center, around the throne, were four living beings covered with eyes in front and behind. (7) The first living being was like a lion, the second living being was like an ox, the third living being had a face that looked human, and the fourth living being was like a flying eagle. (8) Each of the four living beings had six wings and was covered with eyes inside and out; and day and night they never stop saying, “Holy, holy, holy is Adonai, God of heaven’s armies the One who was, who is and who is coming!” (9) And whenever the living beings give glory, honor and thanks to the One sitting on the throne, to the One who lives forever and ever, (10) the twenty-four elders fall down before the One sitting on the throne, who lives forever and ever, and worship him. They throw their crowns in front of the throne and say, (11) “You are worthy, Adonai Eloheinu, to have glory, honor and power, because you created all things—yes, because of your will they were created and came into being!”      Revelation Backgrounds’ Focus We are entering the apocalyptic phase, so there won’t be much geography and probably not many pictures. We’re basically going to track down and read some passages that the original audience likely would have known.\nAs we said at the outset of our study in Revelation, part of the challenge with apocalyptic literature is that the person recording the events is trying to describe the indescribable. Therefore, they are forced to use symbolic language that at times seems other-worldly (because it IS other-worldly; it’s not of this world!). This makes any concrete interpretation difficult.\nAs there are numerous competent commentaries offering various conjectures on what Revelation chapters four and following could mean for 20th and 21st-century believers, we will attempt to limit our study here to identifying and studying the allusions and common themes that appear elsewhere in the Bible. Where possible, we will limit conjectures to those that could have been understood by the original 1st-century audience. In any case, we will attempt to put aside any preconceptions and let the Text speak for itself, even though this may mean quoting an equally cryptic passage from the Old Testament. In the interest of time we won’t be able to unpack everything. Just soak it in and remember Isaiah 55:\n Isa 55:8-11 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the LORD. (9) For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts. (10) “For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return there but water the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater, (11) so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.\n Verse 11 means that any time we can spend studying God’s word is productive and profitable time.\nRevelation 4 Cross-reference Verses PDF\nRev 4:1-The Heavenly Temple After these things, I looked; and there before me was a door standing open in heaven; and the voice like a trumpet which I had heard speaking with me before said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after these things.\u0026#34;\nMeta Tauta “after these things”  This serves as a transition from the previous vision of the seven assemblies to this vision in the heavenly throne room.

Each one held a harp and gold bowls filled with pieces of incense, which are the prayers of God’s people; (9) and they sang a new song, “You are worthy to take the scroll and break its seals; because you were slaughtered; at the cost of blood you ransomed for God persons from every tribe, language, people and nation. (10) You made them into a kingdom for God to rule, cohanim to serve him; and they will rule over the earth.” (11) Then I looked, and I heard the sound of a vast number of angels—thousands and thousands, millions and millions! They were all around the throne, the living beings and the elders; (12) and they shouted out, “Worthy is the slaughtered Lamb to receive power, riches, wisdom, strength, honor, glory and praise!” (13) And I heard every creature in heaven, on earth, under the earth and on the sea—yes, everything in them—saying, “To the One sitting on the throne and to the Lamb belong praise, honor, glory and power forever and ever!” (14) The four living beings said, “Amen!” and the elders fell down and worshipped.    Rev 5:1 Next I saw in the right hand of the One sitting on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals; \n    A seal would have been made of clay (later, wax) with an imprint of authentication  During the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem, many documents were destroyed, leaving only the clay seals. Hundreds of these seals have been found all over Israel They are called LMLK (l’melech – to the king) Sometimes they would be tied with a string, with the clay or wax molded around the string – to get to the string, one would need to break the seal Seals still intact let the bearer know that the contents were not altered  In other words, not added or deleted Rev 22:18-19 I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, (19) and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.     This scene resembles when the Torah was given to Moses   Exo 32:15-16 Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets that were written on both sides; on the front and on the back they were written. (16) The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.   This is also descriptive of legal documents of the ancient world.  Keener notes that many such documents had seven seals, which guaranteed no one had open or tampered with them. Consider this passage from Jeremiah: Jer 32:9-15 “And I bought the field at Anathoth from Hanamel my cousin, and weighed out the money to him, seventeen shekels of silver. (10) I signed the deed, sealed it, got witnesses, and weighed the money on scales. (11) Then I took the sealed deed of purchase, containing the terms and conditions and the open copy. (12) And I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my cousin, in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, and in the presence of all the Judeans who were sitting in the court of the guard. (13) I charged Baruch in their presence, saying, (14) ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, both this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware vessel, that they may last for a long time. (15) For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.’   The writing on the outside likely provided the terms and conditions for breaking the seals.

(10) They cried out in a loud voice, “Sovereign Ruler, HaKadosh, the True One, how long will it be before you judge the people living on earth and avenge our blood?” (11) Each of them was given a white robe; and they were told to wait a little longer, until the full number of their fellow-servants should be reached, of their brothers who would be killed, just as they had been.

(17) For the Great Day of their fury has come, and who can stand?”\n Four Horseman of the Apocalypse  The beginning of the woes that will unfold throughout the rest of the book Talmud discusses a seven-year period of calamity followed by the establishment of the Messianic kingdom. There is a general expectation that before the coming of the Messiah, there will be a period of tribulation leading up to the final redemption. Revelation has echoes of Exodus and the plagues on Egypt, with the deliverance of God’s people through the plagues. Horsemen imagery appears twice in Zechariah  Zec 1:8-11 “I saw in the night, and behold, a man riding on a red horse! He was standing among the myrtle trees in the glen, and behind him were red sorrel, and white horses. (9) Then I said, ‘What are these, my lord?’ The angel who talked with me said to me, ‘I will show you what they are.’ (10) So the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, ‘These are they whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.’ (11) And they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees, and said, ‘We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth remains at rest.’ Zec 6:1-8 Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains. And the mountains were mountains of bronze. (2) The first chariot had red horses, the second black horses, (3) the third white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses—all of them strong. (4) Then I answered and said to the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” (5) And the angel answered and said to me, “These are going out to the four winds of heaven (cf. Rev 7:1), after presenting themselves before the Lord of all the earth. (6) The chariot with the black horses goes toward the north country, the white ones go after them, and the dappled ones go toward the south country.” (7) When the strong horses came out, they were impatient to go and patrol the earth.

I saw another angel coming up from the east with a seal from the living God, and he shouted to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea, “Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads!” I heard how many were sealed—144,000 from every tribe of the people of Isra’el: From the tribe of Y’hudah 12,000 were sealed, from the tribe of Re’uven 12,000, from the tribe of Gad 12,000, from the tribe of Asher 12,000, from the tribe of Naftali 12,000, from the tribe of M’nasheh 12,000, from the tribe of Shim`on 12,000, from the tribe of Levi 12,000, from the tribe of Yissakhar 12,000, from the tribe of Z’vulun 12,000, from the tribe of Yosef 12,000, from the tribe of Binyamin 12,000. After this, I looked; and there before me was a huge crowd, too large for anyone to count, from every nation, tribe, people and language. They were standing in front of the throne and in front of the Lamb, dressed in white robes and holding palm branches in their hands; and they shouted, “Victory to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!” All the angels stood around the throne, the elders and the four living beings; they fell face down before the throne and worshipped God, saying, “Amen! “Praise and glory, wisdom and thanks, honor and power and strength belong to our God forever and ever! “Amen!” One of the elders asked me, “These people dressed in white robes—who are they, and where are they from?” “Sir,” I answered, “you know.” Then he told me, “These are the people who have come out of the Great Persecution. They have washed their robes and made them white with the blood of the Lamb. That is why they are before God’s throne. “Day and night they serve him in his Temple; and the One who sits on the throne will put his Sh’khinah upon them. “They will never again be hungry, they will never again be thirsty, the sun will not beat down on them, nor will any burning heat. “For the Lamb at the center of the throne will shepherd them, will lead them to springs of living water, and God will wipe every tear from their eyes.” \nRev 7:1 After this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the land, on the sea or on any tree.\n “After this,” could mean that this vision came after the previous one; not necessarily that the events in chapter 7 necessarily follow those in Chapter 6.  Keener sees 6:12-17 as representing the end of the age, so chapter 7 with the sealing of the faithful must occur beforehand.1 The seven seals/trumpets/bowls could be different visions describing the same things; not necessarily 21 different events in sequence.   Four corners is clearly symbolic – no one in that day believed the earth was square. Here it represents the four directions on the compass. The four winds/horsemen/angels are apparently connected:  Zec 6:1-8 Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains. And the mountains were mountains of bronze. (2) The first chariot had red horses, the second black horses, (3) the third white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses—all of them strong. (4) Then I answered and said to the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” (5**) And the angel answered and said to me, “These are going out to the four winds of heaven, after presenting themselves before the Lord of all the ear**th. (6) The chariot with the black horses goes toward the north country, the white ones go after them, and the dappled ones go toward the south country.” (7) When the strong horses came out, they were impatient to go and patrol the earth. And he said, “Go, patrol the earth.” So they patrolled the earth.     Rev 7:2-3 I saw another angel coming up from the east with a seal from the living God, and he shouted to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea, “Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads!\u0026#34;\n This seal is God’s signet ring; i.e., His stamp of authentication From Rev 14:1, we know that the seal was the name of the Lamb and of his Father. Rev 14:1 Then I looked, and behold, on Mount Zion stood the Lamb, and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads.  This is a challnge to interpret since we believe there are more than 144,000 servants of God. See discussion at Rev 7:4-8.

Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. And another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer, and he was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne, and the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before God from the hand of the angel. Then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth, and there were peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake. Now the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to blow them. The first angel blew his trumpet, and there followed hail and fire, mixed with blood, and these were thrown upon the earth. And a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up. The second angel blew his trumpet, and something like a great mountain, burning with fire, was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood. A third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed. The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, blazing like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many people died from the water, because it had been made bitter. The fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of their light might be darkened, and a third of the day might be kept from shining, and likewise a third of the night. Then I looked, and I heard an eagle crying with a loud voice as it flew directly overhead, “Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, at the blasts of the other trumpets that the three angels are about to blow!”\nVideo\n  Introduction  We are waiting on the opening of all seven seals to open the document of reception Seals 1-4 were the four horsemen, with their associated calamities Seal #5 were the martyrs crying out to God for justice. They were told to wait a little longer. Seal #6 unleashes the Day of the Lord with earthquake, sun going to black, the sky being rolled up, with the earth-dwellers crying out for refuge from God’s wrath. Most scholars see all six seals as yet future, but an argument may be made that the first 5 could have been opened in the first century, while the sixth is still to come.  In other words, the first 5 represent birth pangs that increase in intensity as the time of delivery nears. In Matthew 24, Jesus says when we see the same types of things as in the first five seals, the end is “not yet.”    Rev 8:1 When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.\n Silence  God paused to hear the silent prayers of the saints, corresponding to the time of daily prayers/sacrifices at the temple The priest in charge of the incense would be inside the temple while the people outside were praying.   Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist was that incense priest Luk 1:21 And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in the temple.  In the absence of a temple, the congregants pray in silence, as they do today in the synagogue in the Amidah prayer.   Dan 6:10 When Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he went to his house where he had windows in his upper chamber open toward Jerusalem. He got down on his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously. Jerusalem was in rubble, yet Daniel still faced Jerusalem when He prayed.  An alternate conjecture is that God paused to hear the defense of Earth-dwellers who feel the sixth seal was unwarranted/unfair.  Lo and behold, they have nothing to say. *If the seven trumpets are not sequential but are more of a retelling of events that happened during the seven seals, the pause could be the end of the earth age (the sixth seal), and the beginning of the Messianic age (aka, what we call the “age to come”) The Messianic Age is often seen as a type of “sabbath rest” In fact, the ancient sages said there would be 6000 years of man fruitless toil, followed by 1000 years of Messiah’s sabbath peace      Rev 8:2 Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. \n Seven angels – Judaic tradition during the first century held seven archangels serving on God’s council: Gabriel, Michael, Raphael, Uriel, Saraquel, Raguel, and Remiel (with the first two mentioned directly in the Bible, and the first four being, in a sense, preeminent over the other three Trumpets  Called army to war, worshippers to the …","date":1651881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641940883,"objectID":"45b4e876354f4f3e480ad8a2b2e087d8","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/rev08/","publishdate":"2022-05-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/rev08/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Trumpet Judgments - Revelation 8","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":"Table of Contents    Video Introduction      Video   Introduction Written commentary coming soon.\n","date":1619913600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641940883,"objectID":"f83b58fae97d605885f5fe832c238993","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb2/sermon-mount-iii/","publishdate":"2021-05-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb2/sermon-mount-iii/","section":"commentary","summary":"Table of Contents    Video Introduction      Video   Introduction Written commentary coming soon.","tags":["Matthew 6","Luke 6","Luke 11","Luke 12"],"title":"Sermon on the Mount III ✧ Gospel Backgrounds","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":"Table of Contents    Video Introduction      Video   Introduction Written commentary coming soon.\n","date":1620518400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641940883,"objectID":"bc696cca82627c8edbe575377f9bdcf3","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb2/17b-sermon-mount-iv/","publishdate":"2021-05-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb2/17b-sermon-mount-iv/","section":"commentary","summary":"Table of Contents    Video Introduction      Video   Introduction Written commentary coming soon.","tags":["Matthew 7"],"title":"Sermon on the Mount Iv ✧ Gospel Backgrounds","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Revelation Backgrounds"],"content":"Table of Contents    Introduction Rev 9:1-2 Rev 9:3-5 Rev 9:6 Rev 9:7-11 Rev 9:13:15 Rev 9:16-19 Rev 9:20-21      Video\n  Read/hear the passage\nRevelation 9\nThe fifth angel sounded his shofar, and I saw a star that had fallen out of heaven onto the earth, and he was given the key to the shaft leading down to the Abyss. He opened the shaft of the Abyss, and there went up smoke from the shaft like the smoke of a huge furnace; the sun was darkened, and the sky too, by the smoke from the shaft. Then out of the smoke onto the earth came locusts, and they were given power like the power scorpions have on earth. They were instructed not to harm the grass on the earth, any green plant, or any tree, but only the people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads. The locusts were not allowed to kill them, only to inflict pain on them for five months, and the pain they caused was like the pain of a scorpion sting. In those days, people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will elude them. Now, these locusts looked like horses outfitted for battle. On their heads were what looked like crowns of gold, and their faces were like human faces. They had hair like women’s hair, and their teeth were like those of lions. Their chests were like iron breastplates, and the sound their wings made was like the roar of many horses and chariots rushing into battle. They had tails like those of scorpions, with stings, and in their tails was their power to hurt people for five months. They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is “Abaddon” and in our language, “Destroyer.” The first woe has passed, but there are still two woes to come. The sixth angel sounded his shofar, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the gold altar before God, saying to the sixth angel, the one with the shofar, “Release the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates!” And they were released. These four angels had been kept ready for this moment, for this day and month and year, to kill a third of mankind, and the number of cavalry soldiers was two hundred million! —I heard the number. Here is how the horses looked in the vision: the riders had breastplates that were fire-red, iris-blue, and sulfur-yellow; the horses’ heads were like lions’ heads; and from their mouths issued fire, smoke, and sulfur. It was these three plagues that killed a third of mankind—the fire, smoke, and sulfur issuing from the horses’ mouths. For the power of the horses was in their mouths—and also in their tails, for their tails were like snakes with heads, and with them, they could cause injury. The rest of mankind, those who were not killed by these plagues, even then did not turn from what they had made with their own hands—they did not stop worshipping demons and idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood, which cannot see or hear or walk. Nor did they turn from their murdering, their involvement with the occult and with drugs, their sexual immorality, or their stealing.\nIntroduction  This passage has an allusion to Joel 2  “Blow a trumpet in Zion; sound an alarm on my holy mountain! Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, for the day of the LORD, is coming; it is near, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness! Like blackness, there is spread upon the mountains a great and powerful people; their like has never been before, nor will be again after them through the years of all generations. Fire devours before them, and behind them, a flame burns. The land is like the garden of Eden before them, but behind them, a desolate wilderness, and nothing escapes them. Their appearance is like the appearance of horses, and like war horses, they run. As with the rumbling of chariots, they leap on the tops of the mountains, like the crackling of a flame of fire devouring the stubble, like a powerful army drawn up for battle. Before them, peoples are in anguish; all faces grow pale. Like warriors, they charge; like soldiers, they scale the wall. They march each on his way; they do not swerve from their paths. They do not jostle one another; each marches in his path; they burst through the weapons and are not halted. They leap upon the city, they run upon the walls, they climb up into the houses, they enter through the windows like a thief. The earth quakes before them; the heavens tremble. The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining. The LORD utters his voice before his army, for his camp is exceedingly great; he who executes his word is powerful. For the day of the LORD is great and very awesome; who can endure it? “Yet even now,” declares the LORD, “return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning;” Tear your heart, not your garments; and turn to ADONAI your God. For he is merciful and compassionate, slow to anger, rich in grace, and willing to change his mind about disaster.

He was dressed in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head; his face was like the sun, his legs like columns of fire; and he had a little scroll lying open in his hand. He planted his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land and shouted in a voice as loud as the roar of a lion; and when he shouted, seven thunderclaps sounded with voices that spoke. When the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven say, \u0026#34;Seal up the things the seven thunders said, do not write them down!\u0026#34; Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted his right hand toward heaven and swore by the One who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and what is in it, earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it: \u0026#34;There will be no more delay; on the contrary, in the days of the sound from the seventh angel when he sounds his shofar, the hidden plan of God will be brought to completion, the Good News as he proclaimed it to his servants the prophets.\u0026#34; Next, the voice which I had heard from heaven spoke to me again and said, \u0026#34;Go, take the scroll lying open in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the land!\u0026#34; So, I went over to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll; and he said to me, \u0026#34;Take it and eat it. It will turn your stomach bitter, but in your mouth, it will be sweet as honey.\u0026#34; I took the little scroll from the angel\u0026#39;s hand and ate it; and in my mouth, it was sweet as honey; but after I had swallowed it, my stomach turned bitter. Then I was told, \u0026#34;You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings.\u0026#34;\nDaniel 12 Again, we have a brief intermission between the 6th and 7th trumpets, just as we did between the 6th and 7th seals. We have the seven thunders here, and, in Chapter 11, we will have the two witnesses. It’s important to keep in mind that when John wrote this, there were no such things as chapter breaks. As best we can, we need to remove the chapter breaks and read Revelation as a single continuous document.\nRevelation 10 has many similarities to Daniel 12:\nDaniel 12:1-10: “At that time shall arise, Michael, the great prince who has charge of your people. And there shall be a time of trouble, such as never has been since there was a nation till that time. But at that time, your people shall be delivered, everyone whose name shall be found written in the book. And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. And those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the sky above; and those who turn many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever. But you, Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book until the time of the end. Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase.” Then I, Daniel, looked, and behold, two others stood, one on this bank of the stream and one on that bank of the stream. And someone said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream, “How long shall it be till the end of these wonders?” And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream; he raised his right hand and his left hand toward heaven and swore by him who lives forever that it would be for a time, times, and half a time, and that when the shattering of the power of the holy people comes to an end all these things would be finished. I heard, but I did not understand. Then I said, “O my lord, what shall be the outcome of these things?” He said, “Go your way, Daniel, for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of the end. Many shall purify themselves and make themselves white and be refined, but the wicked shall act wickedly. And none of the wicked shall understand, but those who are wise shall understand.\nRev 10:1-3 Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head, and his face was like the sun and his legs like pillars of fire. He had a little scroll open in his hand. And he set his right foot on the sea, his left foot on the land, and called out with a loud voice, like a lion roaring. \n  Another angel. Mighty angel #1 was in Rev 5:2, And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?”\n  So this is Mighty angel #2. Apparently, he’s large, with one foot on land and the other on sea, but also large in authority and dominion. The mission is the entire world.\n  Description:\n  “He comes with the clouds” is a familiar description of Jesus.\n  Rainbow was the covenant sign God gave to Noah after the Flood.\n  Face like the sun and legs like bronze are descriptions from Revelation 1.\n Here is a hint that John was at least thinking in Hebrew Hebrew has the same word for feet and legs; however, …","date":1653609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641940883,"objectID":"379d9dda28dbd8fce8f6dc354c300035","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/rev-10/","publishdate":"2022-05-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/rev-10/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Revelation 10","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":"Table of Contents    Video Introduction      Video   Introduction Written commentary coming soon.\n","date":1622332800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641940883,"objectID":"090dc2f243740804c1625296e9af5ff6","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb2/19-parables/","publishdate":"2021-05-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb2/19-parables/","section":"commentary","summary":"Table of Contents    Video Introduction      Video   Introduction Written commentary coming soon.","tags":["Matthew 13"],"title":"Parables ✧ Gospel Backgrounds 19","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Revelation Backgrounds"],"content":"Table of Contents  Revelation 11  Introduction Rev 11:1-2  Rev 11:3 Rev 11:4 Rev 11:5-6 Rev 11:7-8 Rev 11:9-10 Rev 11:11-12 Rev 11:13-14  Rev 11:15-17  Rev 11:18 Rev 11:19 Seven Great Openings Perspective - we’re never alone      Video\n  Revelation 11  I was given a measuring rod like a stick and told, \u0026#34;Get up, and measure the Temple of God and the altar, and count how many people are worshipping there! But the court outside the Temple, leave that out; don\u0026#39;t measure it; because it has been given to the Goyim, and they will trample over the holy city for forty-two months. \u0026#34;Also, I will give power to my two witnesses; and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, dressed in sackcloth.\u0026#34; These are the two olive trees and the two menorahs standing before the Lord of the earth. If anyone tries to do them harm, fire comes out of their mouth and consumes their enemies—yes, if anyone tries to harm them, that is how he must die. They have the authority to shut up the sky so that no rain falls during the period of their prophesying; also, they have the authority to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want. When they finish their witnessing, the beast coming up out of the Abyss will fight against them, overcome them and kill them; and their dead bodies will lie in the main street of the great city whose name, to reflect its spiritual condition, is \u0026#34;S\u0026#39;dom\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;Egypt\u0026#34;—the city where their Lord was executed on a stake. Some from the nations, tribes, languages, and peoples see their bodies for three-and-a-half days and do not permit the corpses to be placed in a tomb. The people living in the Land rejoice over them, they celebrate and send each other gifts, because these two prophets tormented them so. But after the three-and-a-half days a breath of life from God entered them, they stood up on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them. Then the two heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, \u0026#34;Come up here!\u0026#34; And they went up into heaven in a cloud, while their enemies watched them. In that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were awestruck and gave glory to the God of heaven. The second woe has passed; see, the third woe is coming quickly. The seventh angel sounded his shofar; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, \u0026#34;The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and his Messiah, and he will rule forever and ever!\u0026#34; The twenty-four elders sitting on their thrones in God\u0026#39;s presence fell on their faces and worshipped God, saying, \u0026#34;We thank you, Adonai, God of heaven\u0026#39;s armies, the One who is and was, that you have taken your power and have begun to rule. \u0026#34;The Goyim raged. But now your rage has come, the time for the dead to be judged, the time for rewarding your servants the prophets, and your holy people, those who stand in awe of your name, both small and great. It is also the time for destroying those who destroy the earth.\u0026#34; Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened, and the Ark of the Covenant was seen in his Temple; and there were flashes of lightning, voices, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and violent hail.\nIntroduction Missler notes a few elements related to setting:\n  Time: first half of 70th week of Daniel\n  Place: Begins in Jerusalem, specifically note Israel has a restored Temple. Ends in heaven.\n  We have a distinction between Jews and nations, which Stern calls “Goyim.”\n  Goyim are those gentiles/gentile nations at enmity with God and His people.\n  Gentiles in the church are supposed to be Ger Toshav not goyim.\n  Ger Toshav is the term in the Hebrew Bible to denote non-Jews who follow the God of Israel. Literally, it means “resident alien” but connotatively it refers to a “righteous gentile.”\n  Sadly many in the church throughout history have acted more like goyim, leading most Jews to refer to Christians as Goyim, but that’s for another discussion.\n    In any case, the above distinction between Jews and Goyim, with no mention of the church, leads many to believe that the church is not present during this period in time.\n    We are roughly midway through the book\n  Chapter 11 will see the conclusion of the 2nd woe and the beginning of the 7th Trumpet.\n  Rev 11:1-2  I was given a measuring rod like a stick and told, \u0026#34;Get up, and measure the Temple of God and the altar, and count how many people are worshipping there! 2 But the court outside the Temple, leave that out; don\u0026#39;t measure it; because it has been given to the Goyim, and they will trample over the holy city for forty-two months.\nTemple:   Matthew 24:15 says “when you see the abomination…standing in the holy pace…”, there has to be a temple standing.\n  It had been well past 42 months since the destruction of the Temple when Revelation was written.\n  Either this prophecy had to be fulfilled before 70 CE or there is another temple yet future.\n  The enemies of God have had a …","date":1654128000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641940883,"objectID":"c7a80807507b27d885e8b268401ccb46","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/revelation/rev11/","publishdate":"2022-06-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/revelation/rev11/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Revelation 11 - Two Witnesses","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":"Table of Contents    Video Introduction      Video   Introduction Written commentary coming soon.\n","date":1622937600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641940883,"objectID":"20e3fdbcc8b2abee0b796e7f23e6b97c","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb2/20-the-other-side/","publishdate":"2021-06-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb2/20-the-other-side/","section":"commentary","summary":"Table of Contents    Video Introduction      Video   Introduction Written commentary coming soon.","tags":["Matthew 8","Matthew 9","Mark 4","Luke 8"],"title":"The Other Side ✧ Gospel Backgrounds 20","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":"Table of Contents    Video      Video   ","date":1622937600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623364883,"objectID":"3d8536fdb04c2f2593b942988bebc2cb","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb2/21-apostles-discourse/","publishdate":"2021-06-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb2/21-apostles-discourse/","section":"commentary","summary":"Table of Contents    Video      Video   ","tags":["Matthew 9","Mark 6","Luke 9","Luke 10"],"title":"Apostles' Discourse ✧ Gospel Backgrounds 21","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":"Table of Contents   window.ESV_CROSSREF_OPTIONS = { body_background_color: \u0026#39;D7E5F0\u0026#39;, header_font_size: 10, body_font_size: 14, footer_font_size: 8, header_font_family: \u0026#39;Arial\u0026#39;, body_font_family: \u0026#39;Times\u0026#39; };   Read/hear the portions:\nSummary\nVideo\n  ","date":1647993600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641940883,"objectID":"3c9f18e556e7ef59a4af538972959cc1","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb2/22-death-of-john/","publishdate":"2022-03-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb2/22-death-of-john/","section":"commentary","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"22.

There were two groups of thought in the early 1st Century. The prevailing view was that divorce was permissible for any justification the husband had. The minority view was that it was only permissible for matters of sexual indiscretion. Jesus responds, generally agreeing with the minority view. His response startles the disciples who exclaim “it is better not to marry”. Jesus responds that in the absence of some physical malformation, one could elect to remain celibate for the sake of the kingdom. The section concludes with the disciples trying keep Jesus safe from crowds, which resulted in preventing little children from accessing Jesus. Jesus corrects the disciples’ thinking and says “let the children come to Me.”\nNext, A rich, young ruler asks Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life. Jesus says to keep the commandments, sell everything, and follow Him. The man went away sad for he had great wealth. Jesus says it is only through God that a rich man can enter the Kingdom. He then tells His disciples that their sacrifices for the Kingdom will be rewarded. Jesus then tells the parable of the hired workers where the owner pays workers who only worked about an hour the same as those who worked all day, causing the later group to grumble. Jesus again predicts his demise at Jerusalem and says the disciples will also drink his Cup of suffering.\nVideos\nPart I: Matthew 19:1-15 | Mark 10:1-16 | Luke 18:15-17\n   Part II: Matthew 19:16-20:28 | Mark 10:17-45 | Luke 18:18-34\n  Introduction  ACTS 17:11 (The Bereans) received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.\n In this episode, we’re going to see that as a society, that culture had strayed a bit from God’s original intent. Moreover, they fully believed they were interpreting the Bible faithfully regarding permissible situations for divorce. Jesus is not just going to redirect them back to the Hebrew Bible, not just the Torah, not just Genesis, but Genesis chapter 1 shows God’s intent for marriage. This is why Acts 17:11 must be first and foremost in our study. It’s what Jesus did.\nMany of the topics are probably familiar to us (divorce, and the man who is told to sell everything). Let’s not let our familiarity be an excuse to not ask questions.\nChuck Missler used to say that the greatest obstacle to truth was the assumption you already have it. Missler also used to say, “where two people agree one is redundant.” these are familiar passages with familiar Protestant interpretations that tend to be repeated from one commentator to the next. As usual, the commentators I am using for this series bring added clarity based on their study of the first century legal and cultural backgrounds.\nThere is value in legitimate academic inquiry and applying Acts 17:11.\nNo condemnation\nAlso, of course, this is a sensitive topic, as many families are affected by divorce or are single parents.\nPerhaps some of us realize we haven’t acted according to the Biblical model for marriage. Or we were a relatively innocent victim of a partner who acted unbiblically. Or maybe there was a legitimate reason for our predicament other than our own sexual misconduct.\nAnother good memory verse is Romans 8:1.\n There is now, therefore, no condemnation for those who are in Jesus the Messiah.\n While these words on divorce may pinch and the practical effects of divorce can’t be minimized, because of who Jesus is and everything he has done on behalf of sinners, you should not feel condemned as long as you are living in unison with Him.\nGeography Jesus has now left the fertile Jezreel and Harod valleys and has most likely crossed the Jordan to make His way down the East Bank towards Jericho. This area, south of the cities of the Decapolis, was Jewish. The terrain is such that water is more plentiful from the numerous brooks on the east side that feed the Jordan. This area is the ancient Gilead, where the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and ½ of Manasseh settled. And we use settled literally and figuratively. They literally settled here (in the sense of settlers) because the land was pleasing to the eye and excellent for raising livestock …","date":1641513600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641579343,"objectID":"e93b7f0d3c5fbdcd4306b77bc188459f","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb3/beyond-the-jordan/","publishdate":"2022-01-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb3/beyond-the-jordan/","section":"commentary","summary":"Jesus receives a question regarding divorce, to which He responds with a narrow interpretation.

In Luke, Jesus also gives the double-parable of the Minas (Pounds) and the King’s Return.\nThe lesson begins with Jesus passing through Jericho on His way up to Jerusalem for the Passover. What Jesus knew, and what we, the readers, know, but what the disciples and others at the scene did not know is that this would be the final stop of His earthly ministry. The most tumultuous and historically significant week in all of human history was about to begin, but first Jesus continues His mission to seek and save the lost sheep of Israel.\nVideo\n  Geography    Matthew 20 Mark 10 Luke 18     29. As they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him. 46. And they came to Jericho. And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd… 35. As he drew near Jericho…    Notes:1 2\nThe fact that Matthew and Mark say they were leaving Jericho, while Luke says they were drawing near Jericho need not concern us. Dr. Bolen writes, “it is apparent that Jesus was leaving the population center of Jericho (as recorded in Matthew) and entering the area of the Herodian city (as recorded in Luke).”3\nThis lesson takes place in and around the city of Jericho. Jericho is only about 15 miles from Jerusalem, but they couldn’t be more opposite in many ways.\n Jericho lies deep in the Jordan Rift Valley, around 900 feet below sea level.  Compare this to Jerusalem, high in the Judean hills at about 2500 feet above sea level4.   In Jericho, freshwater is plentiful from the many springs. It is known as the “city of palms” because it is very much an oasis in the desert.  Jerusalem’s only source of freshwater, the Gihon Spring, can only provide water for a few thousand people per year.   Jericho commands the central east-west approach to Jerusalem, making it strategically important.  The Jordan was relatively easy to cross near Jericho. This factor contributed to the wealth of Zacchaeus, the tax collector who was able to tax people coming and going. Despite having tremendous religious importance, Jerusalem is neither strategic nor wealthy.     More Jericho Background Empires from the Persians to the Romans used Jericho as an administrative center. Alexander the Great had a private estate here. Mark Antony gave Jericho to Cleopatra as a gift. As we noted last time, Herod the Great had a palace here, which would still have been in use as Jesus made His way through the city. Much like he did with Jerusalem, Herod expanded his “footprint” in the city with several public works, military buildings, a hippodrome/theatre complex to entertain the masses, and of course, his lavish private palace.\nIn Israel’s history, we know that Jericho is significant for being the first town Joshua and the Israelites could capture using a unique battle plan. Of significance for us is the town of Gilgal. This is where God made the Israelites stop, get circumcised (a very odd thing to do before a battle!), sanctify themselves, and celebrate Passover (Joshua 5:1-12).\nGoing back even further, archeologists have unearthed artifacts that date to ~8000 BCE in the new stone age period – that’s 6000 years before Abraham. Historians believe Jericho is the oldest, continuously inhabited city in the world.\n    The setting here is a little over a week before Passover. Crowds are beginning to swell. The beginning of the narrow Ascent of Adummim would have represented a bottleneck, with people backing into Jericho. Additionally, primarily, but perhaps not exclusively due to Jesus, the expectation grew for a Messianic deliverer. Such hope is always higher around Passover, as the feast recalls Israel’s miraculous deliverance from oppressive Egypt. Those who realized God sent Jesus had every reason to think a similar redemption was at hand.  Blind Bartimaeus  Mat 20:29-34 Mar 10:46-52 Luk 18:35-43     Matthew 20 Mark 10 Luke 18     29.

And behold, two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!” 31.

The next seven days are a roller coaster of emotions, ending on the highest peak of all, the Resurrection.\nLesson 39 will be in two parts. Part I will review the Ascent of Adummim, which connects Jericho to Jerusalem. We’ll meet up with Jesus and the recently resurrected Lazarus in Bethany, look at how Jesus procures a donkey for his entry into Jerusalem, and examine the crowd’s reaction as they welcomed Jesus.\nVideo\n        Introduction: The Final Week Begins A note about the “Final Week” – We are “only” in John chapters 11 and 12, so the last ten chapters of John deal with this week and post-resurrection. Lancaster’s commentary is a five-volume set. Each volume has around 400 pages. The Triumphal entry occurs about ½ way into volume 4. In other words, even though it looks like we’re nearing the end from a timeline perspective, we have a LOT of Gospel still ahead of us. Our format will take another 14 lessons to cover the events in the eight calendar days between Palm Sunday and Resurrection Sunday.\nThis is undoubtedly the most influential and most personally significant week in all of history.\n   Luke 19:28     And when he had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.    The “these things” are the Minas and the King’s Returning parables we studied in Lesson 38.\nThis photo1 shows the ancient path that led the 18 miles (29 km) up from Jericho to Jerusalem. One always goes “up to Jerusalem.”\nThis chart comes from AD Riddle2 and shows Herod’s palace, Jericho, to Jerusalem. Presumably, the -720 is from the Herodian Palaces, west of the modern city and slightly higher. Modern Jericho’s height is listed at -864 feet, making it the lowest and the oldest continuously inhabited city on Earth. Today much of the Kidron valley has been filled in, so the elevation difference between that and Jerusalem is not as significant. Still, one had to be in excellent physical shape to make this trek. Today we do it in an air-conditioned bus with Wi-Fi.\nThe beginning of the Following the Messiah episode 8 has an excellent segment about this ascent. Watch through 8:55.\n  Will he come to the feast?    John 11:55-57     55 Now, the Passover of the Ioudaioi was at hand, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves. 56 They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, “What do you think? That he will not come to the feast at all?” 57 Now, the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, he should let them know so that they might arrest him.    In the week leading up to Passover, Jerusalem would swell with Pilgrims. By some estimates, a population of perhaps a few hundred thousand could swell to 2-3 million. This helps explain several dynamics, most notably why the city’s leadership (both the Romans and the temple establishment) might be more on edge. It also makes locating one person in that crowd a non-trivial task.Ceremonial purification could take up to a week, especially if that person had come into contact with a corpse (Numbers 19). The Jewish Sages applied those same standards to any Jew living in a foreign country – gentile nations are inherently unclean. Remember this point when we get to Acts. This notion of ceremonial uncleanliness has a lot to do with the disciples’ attitudes and reticence concerning dining with non-Jews.\nThey were looking for Jesus, meaning the people were wondering whether He would claim his Messianic title. The Passover/Feast of Unleavened bread was compulsory, so it would be very unusual for Him not to show up, especially since He only had to travel a relatively short distance from Galilee.\nThe public didn’t realize that “the game’s afoot,” as Sherlock Holmes might say. The Jerusalem “deep state”\u0026#34; had already decreed that Jesus needed to be taken out.\n A Passover Seder If you get a chance to participate in a Passover Seder, you should take advantage of it. It is rich with Symbolism and Biblical history. Christians/Messianic Jews see additional symbolism that represents Jesus. For example, there are traditionally three pieces of Matzah wafers. The way it is baked, it has holes (like saltine crackers) and stripes.

Mat 6:24 “No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money   Rev 3:17-18 For you keep saying, ‘I am rich, I have gotten rich, I don’t need a thing!’ You don’t know that you are the one who is wretched, pitiable, poor, blind and naked!

Pro 3:11-12 My son, do not despise the LORD’s discipline or be weary of his reproof, (12) for the LORD reproves him whom he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights.

Gen 3:8-9 And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.

Mat 3:17 and behold, a voice from heaven said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.” Mat 16:15-16 He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” (16) Simon Peter replied, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” Joh 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.   (19) I know what you are doing, your love, trust, service, and perseverance. And I know that you are doing more now than before. Job 17:9 Yet the righteous holds to his way, and he who has clean hands grows stronger and stronger.\nPro 4:18 But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day.\nJohn 15:2 Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.\nGal 5:22-23 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, (23) gentleness, self-control; against such things, there is no law. Th 1:3 We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers, as is right, because your faith is growing abundantly, and the love of every one of you for one another is increasing.   (20) But I have this against you: you continue to tolerate that Izevel woman, the one who claims to be a prophet, but is teaching and deceiving my servants to commit sexual sin and eat food that has been sacrificed to idols. (21) I gave her time to turn from her sin, but she doesn’t want to repent of her immorality. Deu 13:1-5 “If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or a wonder, (2) and the sign or wonder that he tells you comes to pass, and if he says, ‘Let us go after other gods,’ which you have not known, ‘and let us serve them,’ (3) you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams. … (5) But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death because he has taught rebellion against the LORD your God…   (24) But to the rest of you in Thyatira, to those who do not hold this teaching, who have not learned what some people call the ‘deep things’ of the Adversary, I say this: I am not loading you up with another burden; (25) only hold fast to what you have until I come. Act 15:28-29 For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements: (29) that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.” 1 Cor 2:10 these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.   Rev 2:26-29 To him who wins the victory and does what I want until the goal is reached, I will give him authority over the nations; (27) he will rule them with a staff of iron and dash them to pieces like pottery, (28) just as I have received authority from my Father. I will also give him the morning star. (29) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.” \u0026#39; Psa 2:1-12 Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain? (2) The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and against his Anointed, saying, (3) “Let us burst their bonds apart and cast away their cords from us.” (4) He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord holds them in derision. (5) Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying, (6) “As for me, I have set my King on Zion, my holy hill.” (7) I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, “You are my Son; today I have begotten you.

(27) And you also will bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning. 1Pe 1:10-12 Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired carefully, (11) inquiring what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories. (12) It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you, in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look. Zechariah 4:2,6,10 (2) And he said to me, “What do you see?” I said, “I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it (6) Then he said to me, “This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the LORD of hosts.

For the LORD sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.” Pro 21:2 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but the LORD weighs the heart. Deu 12:8 “You shall not do according to all that we are doing here today, everyone doing whatever is right in his own eyes, Jdg 17:6 In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.   (2) Wake up, and strengthen what remains, before it dies too! For I have found what you are doing incomplete in the sight of my God. Joh 11:11 After saying these things, he said to them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him.” Mar 14:38 Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.” Jas 1:22-24 But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. (23) For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. (24) For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like.   (3) So remember what you received and heard, and obey it, and turn from your sin! For if you don’t wake up, I will come like a thief; and you don’t know at what moment I will come upon you. Deu 6:3-9 Hear therefore, O Israel, and be careful to do them, that it may go well with you, and that you may multiply greatly, as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you, in a land flowing with milk and honey. (4) “Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one. (5) You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. (6) And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart.

Lev 19:2 “Speak to all the congregation of the people of Israel and say to them, You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy. Isa 47:4 Our Redeemer—the LORD of hosts is his name— is the Holy One of Israel. Joh 14:6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life.

And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, (33) and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom, there will be no end.” And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be since I am a virgin?” (35) And the angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy—the Son of God. Mat 16:19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” Act 15:15-18 And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written, (16) “‘After this, I will return, and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen; I will rebuild its ruins, and I will restore it, (17) that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles who are called by my name, says the Lord, who makes these things (18) known from of old.’ (Quoting Amos 9:11-12 and referencing Isaiah 16:5)   (8) “I know what you are doing.

(7) And he will swallow up on this mountain the covering that is cast over all peoples, the veil that is spread over all nations. (8) He will swallow up death forever; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from all faces, and the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for the LORD has spoken.

Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever—” 23 therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken. 24 He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life.

Note that he does not say this is Jesus speaking directly. In fact, we know from verses 1:1 and 22:8 that it is NOT Jesus speaking to John but an Angel. Nonetheless, the depiction is assuredly that of Jesus Messiah in His glorified state.\nFor our background, we will read Daniel chapters 7 and 10 along with Revelation 1 and note the consistency of idioms used throughout the Bible, Old and New Testaments, specifically the descriptions of the “one like a Son of Man” and the “Ancient of Days”. For this reason, we like to say that our Bible is 66 separate books, but one integrated message.\nWe ended last lesson with John hearing a great voice behind him. Now here in verse 12, we see John turning to look and he sees the gold seven branched Menorah. This menorah probably looked much like the one in the picture. Next we learn that the one like a Son of Man was in the midst of the Menorah and later we will see that each branch, each light, is one of the seven congregations A Menorah is one object with seven branches, which draws images of John 15. Jesus said, “I am the vine, you are the branches.” We are supposed to be the vessels through which God’s light shines. Jesus also said in John 15 “abide in Me.” We must remain connected to the source. A Menorah is a great picture of Jesus.\nNext we have a description of the person John saw, which is nearly identical to Daniel’s visions. This description bears some resemblance to the High Priest carrying out his duties in the Tabernacle. One commentator said, “The garments are highly symbolic, showing that Jesus is the heavenly priest, fully prepared and qualified to carry out His duties.”\nIn verse 19, we will look at this Greek phrase μετα ταυτα (meta tauta), which is often translated as “after these things.” The phrase appears exactly ten times in Revelation and acts as a signpost to let us know where we are. In what is called gematria, certain numbers that reappear throughout the Bible appear to be associated with specific themes. We’ve talked previously how the number seven indicates perfection or completeness. All this means is that scholars have looked at where seven (or groups/multiples of seven) appear and they have noticed the theme of completeness. Along these lines, 10 indicates divine order. The most obvious examples are the Ten Commandments and the Ten plagues. There were also ten generations from Adam to Noah, then the Flood came. Meta Tauta will signify an additional stage of God setting things in order.\nThe lesson will conclude with a side-by-side comparison of Revelation 1 and Daniel 10. This demonstrates that our 66 books we call the Bible is ONE integrated message and it consistent from Genesis to Revelation. There was no “plan B,” where God decided the Old Testament was irrelevant (God forbid!). Jesus Himself says this. Not until all things have been fulfilled will one jot or tittle pass away from the Torah (Mat 5:18).\nRead/Listen to the portions Also read Daniel 7 and Daniel 10 straight through.\nwindow.ESV_CROSSREF_OPTIONS = { body_background_color: \u0026#39;D7E5F0\u0026#39;, header_font_size: 10, body_font_size: 14, footer_font_size: 8, body_font_family: \u0026#39;Times\u0026#39; };     Revelation 1:12-20 References     12.

Zec 4:2 And he said to me, “What do you see?” I said, “I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it.   13. and among the menorahs was someone like a Son of Man, wearing a robe down to his feet and a gold band around his chest Exo 28:4 These are the garments that they shall make: a breast piece, an ephod, a robe, a coat of checker work, a turban, and a sash.

Jesus had to learn of this from the Father. It is important to note that it is the ANGEL who is speaking to John. What makes this challenging is that the angel speaks of members of the Godhead in the 1st person.  In the Old Testament, we often see “the Angel of the LORD” also speaking of God the Father in the 1st person. I have often assumed that the Angel of the LORD was a pre-incarnate appearance of Jesus. We call this a “theophany.” Now after studying the context of chapter 1, it may not be that simple.     The immediate recipients were His servants at the seven churches in Asia.  As we work through the book, begin to notice when things are out of place and how God sets things in their proper order. These Jewish congregations are outside of the land of Israel  The promise made by God to their ancestors was to inherit the Land. By the end of Revelation, God will set this right and they will be back inside the Land.     Then the document would have spread to all believers at the end of the first century. Then, indirectly, Revelation is written for all believers since, including you and me.      John frequently uses the terms “testimony,” and “witness.” The picture to the right is a Dead Sea Scroll fragment (4Q175) called Testimonia (“Messianic Anthology”), 1st century BC.\n He employs courtroom terminology in all his writings. In the Gospel of John, he is providing evidence that Jesus is the promised Messiah for all Israel in addition to evidence that the corrupt Jerusalem Temple establishment is usurping their power. In Revelation, he testifies that not only is Jesus the coming king, this time it’s not just the corrupt Temple establishment but the corrupt world system that is on trial.    Revelation is unique because it is the only book in the Bible that promises a blessing for those who read, hear and obey.\n  In chapter 1 we see the first of several patterns of seven.\n The commentary section of talmidimway.org will list many of these.  For example “Messiah” (v.1) and “Amen” (v.7) each occur exactly seven times throughout the book. There are seven “blessings”, beginning with v.3. The description of Jesus in vs. 5-6 has seven attributes.      In the lesson, we will also unpack what John may have meant by, “I was in the Spirit on the Day of the Lord.”\n  Read/Listen to the portions Be sure to read the cross-references.\nwindow.ESV_CROSSREF_OPTIONS = { body_background_color: \u0026#39;D7E5F0\u0026#39;, header_font_size: 10, body_font_size: 14, footer_font_size: 8, body_font_family: \u0026#39;Times\u0026#39; };     Revelation 1:1-11 References     Rev 1:1.

The next seven days are a roller coaster of emotions, ending on the highest peak of all, the Resurrection.\nLesson 39 will be in two parts. Part I will review the Ascent of Adummim, which connects Jericho to Jerusalem. We’ll meet up with Jesus and the recently resurrected Lazarus in Bethany, look at how Jesus procures a donkey for his entry into Jerusalem, and examine the crowd’s reaction as they welcomed Jesus.\nThe lesson begins with Jesus and His talmidim leaving Jericho to make the 18-mile journey to Jerusalem. We can recreate this journey when we go to Israel (albeit from an air-conditioned bus with wi-fi). Although 18 miles is not that far, the elevation gain is steep, so one had to be in excellent physical shape to do it on foot. As the “Following the Messiah” hosts point out, it would be challenging to do that strenuous hike and carry on a conversation simultaneously. What was going through Jesus’ mind, knowing what would happen? What was going through the disciples’ minds, wondering what would happen?\nNext, in John, we have the Ioudaioi wondering whether Jesus would come to the feast? This is an odd thought, as attendance at the feast was compulsory for all able-bodied Jewish men. In John 11:56-57, John distinguishes the “Ioudaioi” and the “chief priests and the Pharisees.” Not all “Jews” (Ioudaioi) were in on the plot, and we also know that not all Pharisees were in on the plot either (Nicodemus, for one). If we keep reading in John 12:9-11, we see that many Ioudaioi were “believing in Jesus.” This was because of Lazarus’ testimony.\nWe assume Jesus spends Shabbat (Friday sundown to Saturday sundown) with Mary, Martha, and Lazarus (John may be indicating this in John 12:2-8). Then on Sunday morning, Jesus gives instructions to procure a donkey. We briefly discuss whether this represents a prophecy or whether Jesus was taking advantage of the hospitality system of that day (perhaps combined with His familiarity with the area). Just as with the beggars in Jericho, Matthew says “a colt and his mother,” whereas Mark and Luke focus only on the “colt.” Matthew occasionally says there were two of something when Luke/Mark focuses on the more significant one (perhaps this is a result of his former job as a tax collector!). The Triumphal entry is a big deal for one primary reason. Every other time before this, when the people wanted to anoint Jesus as their leader, He said, “my hour has not yet come.” Now, Jesus not only permits it, but He also arranges it in a way that has direct parallels to Solomon, another “son of David.” He would ride a donkey into Jerusalem, indicating that he comes not as a conqueror but in peace.\nThe crowds shout “Hosanna” (Hebrew for “save us now” or “save us please!\u0026#34;) and wave palm branches, which was a direct allusion to the days of the Maccabees, who defeated the Seleucid Greeks in 166 BCE. In other words, they were encouraging Jesus to take over politically. They also chant Psalms 118, another messianic reference. It was unmistakable that they were crowning Jesus as the messiah, which Jesus is Ok with (Luke 19:40) . The problem is (to borrow a quote), “this is not the messiah you’re looking for.”\nTo close the lesson, we look at the “cheapest souvenir in Israel.” When the Pharisees heard the people chanting that Psalm in THAT circumstance, they feared reprisal from the leadership, this is one indication that these Pharisees were not against Jesus but were on his side. They simply feared for his safety. Jesus said, “If these kept quiet, the very stones would cry out.” So the cheapest souvenir is to bring home one of the stones that didn’t cry out.\nPart II will continue with Jesus weeping over Jerusalem, a precise prophecy that would be fulfilled around 40 years later, and other activities in the Temple.\nRead/Listen to the portions window.ESV_CROSSREF_OPTIONS = { body_background_color: \u0026#39;D7E5F0\u0026#39;, header_font_size: 10, body_font_size: 14, footer_font_size: 8, body_font_family: \u0026#39;Times\u0026#39; };   Matthew 21:1-17 Mark 11:1-11 Luke 19:28-40 John 11:55-12:1, John 12:9-16  Note: There is a known textual problem with John 12:2-8, which we will discuss when we get to Matthew 26.\nWatch the videos Gospel Backgrounds Lesson Video:   The beginning of the Following the Messiah episode 8 has an excellent segment about the Triumphal Entry.

Revelation can be a complex book, but these keys will help assure we get started on the right path.\nWhile many commentators focus on what Revelation may mean to us living in the 21st Century, very few Protestant commentators take the time to understand the historical, first-century context. Revelation, as it turns out, is the most Jewish book in the New Testament. There are over 800 allusions to the Old Testament in the book’s 404 verses. The reasons many people struggle with the book is because we ignore its Jewishness.\nWe have developed “Seven Keys to Interpretation,” which we will discuss in the lesson.\n Follow the “Talmidim Way” - We want to learn to walk in the dust of Yeshua our Rabbi just as His original Talmidim, His disciples such as John did. Be open to the Spirit’s leading - Understanding what God wants us to learn is way more important that making sure others know our beliefs Be a Berean - Check everything out against scripture. If our interpretation doesn’t fit, it might be something we need to discard. Understand the intended audience - They were Jewish, or if they were gentiles, they were worshipping in a Jewish setting, which would have almost nothing in common with our western protestant churches today Revelation is a Jewish Book - For every verse in Revelation there is a 2:1 ratio of Old Testament illusions. If we try to understand Revelation without this background, we’ll be lost. With it, we’ll be much better off Be suspicious if an interpretation does not fit the original context - that is to say, if it could not have been within the realm of possibility for John or the original audience. This is not to say that the book can’t have multiple layers of interpretation, but for our historical and cultural approach, we want to start by making sure it’s something that would have made sense to the original audience. No fear allowed - While books and websites present the events of Revelation as something that should scare an unbeliever (and they probably should be scared), fear has no place in a believer’s heart.  We will also look at who wrote the book and some other details:\n Who wrote Revelation? John the Apostle. We don’t have 100% concrete proof, but the earliest and best evidence suggests it was none other than John, the author of the Gospel and three letters that bear his name. Where was it written? Patmos, which is an island some 35 miles off the coast of Turkey. Revelation 1:9 is our source for this. When was it written? Most conservative scholars land on 90-95 of the Common Era. Iraneus is the earliest source for this information. He was a disciple of Polycarp, who was a disciple of John. Iraneus states John received the relevation during the time of Emperor Domitian. How was Revelation given? Signs and Patterns! Revelation 1:1 contains the Greek word σημαίνω, which literally means “rendered into signs.” Every sign in the Bible points to something. Every sign in Revelation points to a verse (sometimes more than one) in the Old Testament. The pattern of the number seven is also quite conspicuous. Sevens are everywhere in Revelation. Since sevens are also conspicuous throughout the entire Bible, this is often seen as the “fingerprints of the Holy Spirit.” To whom was Revelation written? The seven messianic congregations in Asia Minor.. We are told this in Revelation 1:4. Note that although your Bible may say “seven churches,” the “church” either as a building or an organization did not exist when Revelation was given. We need to avoid what is called an anachronistic fallacy. See the lesson detail for more information. Why was Revelation written? The Hope of HIS RETURN and the Restoration of all things!  We look forward to beginning this study!\nRead/Listen to the portions window.ESV_CROSSREF_OPTIONS = { body_background_color: \u0026#39;D7E5F0\u0026#39;, header_font_size: 10, body_font_size: 14, footer_font_size: 8, body_font_family: \u0026#39;Times\u0026#39; };   Revelation 1:1-9  Watch the video   Audio only  Study the context  Click to read the complete Revelation Backgrounds lesson   ","date":1643068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642085878,"objectID":"7f800e812ad2f9cb6e34d71e3ea167d5","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/post/new-series-revelation-backgrounds/","publishdate":"2022-01-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/new-series-revelation-backgrounds/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome to our series on the book of Revelation we call “Revelation Backgrounds.” In this introductory episode, we will provide an introduction to the book, some background into Jewish Apocalyptic literature, and we’ll provide what we see are Seven Keys to Interpretation.","tags":[],"title":"New series! Revelation Backgrounds","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":"This lesson is titled “Zacchaeus and Bartimaeus” because of the healings, one physical and one spiritual of Blind Bartimaeus and Zacchaeus, the wealthy tax collector. In Luke, Jesus also gives the double-parable of the Minas (Pounds) and the King’s Return. The lesson begins with Jesus passing through Jericho on His way up to Jerusalem for the Passover, where we are presented with two potential textual problems.\n Matthew says they were leaving Jericho, while Mark/Luke says they drew near to Jericho. Matthew says there were two beggars, while Mark/Luke list only one.  Both tensions are easily reconciled and need not distract us from the core teachings of the passage. There are several lessons for us with the healing of Bartimaeus.\nLuke alone tells the story of Zacchaeus, the repentant tax collector. Zacchaeus would have been extremely wealthy, but mainstream Jewish society viewed tax collectors as outcasts. To his credit, he wanted to see Jesus, and, as it turns out, Jesus wanted to see him. Zacchaeus was likely less than five feet tall, so he decided to climb a Sycamore tree to get a better view. Jesus notices the man in the tree, then says He “must” stay with him. Apparently, without any prompting from Jesus, Zacchaeus pledges to give half his goods to the poor. To the extent he defrauded anyone (which he did), he promised to repay with 4x damages. Jesus tells him, “Today salvation has come.” Jesus chose to honor an outcast, and he repented.\nLuke concludes this section with Jesus telling (but not explaining) two parables. Both fall into the category of “Journey parables.” With these parables in Luke 19, Luke makes it a point to tell us that Jesus told the parables “BECAUSE they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.” So whatever interpretation and application we come up with, it must connect somehow to the fact that (as we, the readers, know) the Messianic Kingdom did NOT appear immediately.\nWhat is curious about these parables is that Jesus deliberately compares the King-on-a-journey to the hated and wicked Herod Archelaus. Archelaus was so bad even the Romans got rid of him. So, the reader is presented with a curious question: if Jesus is allegorically speaking of Himself as the King in the parables, why would He so obviously compare Himself to the wicked Archelaus?\nThe video and lesson detail will explore some plausible interpretations and applications of these parables, including one that we might say goes against the grain of our typical expectations. We’ll don our “Acts 17:11 thinking caps” to work through these.\nThe lesson concludes with Luke writing, “when He had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.” In the next lesson, we will examine the Triumphal Entry, which is the first of the most significant seven days in all human history.\nRead/hear the portions window.ESV_CROSSREF_OPTIONS = { body_background_color: \u0026#39;D7E5F0\u0026#39;, header_font_size: 10, body_font_size: 14, footer_font_size: 8, body_font_family: \u0026#39;Times\u0026#39; };   Matthew 20:29-34 Mark 10:46-52 Luke 18:35-19:38 (Primary)  Watch the video   Study the context  Click to read the complete Gospel Backgrounds lesson   ","date":1642636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642085878,"objectID":"7ee39e341789de6b5ab7e9ce5758375a","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/post/38-zaccheaus-and-bartimaus/","publishdate":"2022-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/38-zaccheaus-and-bartimaus/","section":"post","summary":"This lesson is titled “Zacchaeus and Bartimaeus” because of the healings, one physical and one spiritual of Blind Bartimaeus and Zacchaeus, the wealthy tax collector.

We often think that the young man has a “works righteousness” mindset - in other words, if a person has enough good deeds, he or she will merit eternal salvation. This is true to some degree, but notice Jesus’ answer.\nHe doesn’t say “to get eternal life, all you need to do is accept Me into your heart.” In response to the immediate question, Jesus says first “keep the commandments”. Then when pressed further, He says, “one thing you lack: sell everything, give it to the poor, then follow Me.”\nNote that Jesus doesn’t rebuke the young man about being self-righteous, nor does Jesus correct the man’s errant theology. The man had a heart issue, not a head issue. There is a lot more going on with this exchange than it may first appear. We will take a peek under the hood to get at some of the lessons for our lives.\nThe exchange befuddles the disciples. They “remind” Jesus that they HAVE left everything and followed their Rabbi as His talmidim. Jesus assures them that their sacrifices will not go unrewarded.\nMatthew 20 begins with one of my favorite parables, the parable of the workers. A man needs workers for his vineyard. He finds some early in the day, but also at various points throughout the day, including at the “11th hour” right before the work is to end.\nWhen the work is done, the owner calls the workers from last to first and, to the surprise of those hired early, everyone is paid a denarious, a full day’s wage. Those hired early in the day gripe that this is unfair. Is is right that someone who did 1/12 of the work get paid the same as those who did a full day’s work? The owner replies that the first group agreed to the wage, and besides what He does with his money is his business and no one else’s.\nThe parable is rich with meaning and has several practical and spiritual applications. We will discuss a few of these in the lesson.\nThe section concludes with Jesus receiving a request from James and John to sit at Jesus’ right and left hands during the millennial kingdom, which is often portrayed as a great banquet. Instead of rebuking their pride, Jesus explains what it means to sit by his side and “drink His cup”. This act of presumption, naturally, irks the other ten disciples. Jesus explains that our mission as disciples is not to be serve but to serve.\nRead/Listen to the portions window.ESV_CROSSREF_OPTIONS = { body_background_color: \u0026#39;D7E5F0\u0026#39;, header_font_size: 10, body_font_size: 14, footer_font_size: 8, body_font_family: \u0026#39;Times\u0026#39; };   Matthew 19:16-20:28 Mark 10:17-45 Luke 18:18-34  Watch the video   Study the context  Click to read the complete Gospel Backgrounds lesson   ","date":1642032000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642085878,"objectID":"8ab4011f933f247aa89a4884bc3db3a0","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/post/beyond-the-jordan-part-ii/","publishdate":"2022-01-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/beyond-the-jordan-part-ii/","section":"post","summary":"This is part II of the Gospel Backgrounds lesson titled, “Beyond the Jordan.”\nTo begin the lesson, Jesus receives a question from a “rich, young ruler” about what must be done to inherit eternal life.","tags":[],"title":"Beyond the Jordan Part II","type":"post"},{"authors":["Chris Flanagan"],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":"Gospel Backgrounds Lesson 37 is titled “Beyond the Jordan.” We will do this in two parts.\nAfter leaving the Harod Valley [#7 on the map], Jesus makes His way to the Jordan, just south of where it exits the Sea of Galilee. The north-south path along the river in this vicinity was along the eastern shore, which the Gospel writers call “Judea beyond the Jordan.” [8]\nJesus will engage a group of inquisitive (but not necessarily trecharous) Pharisees who want to know the Master’s position on divorce. As it is today, divorce was a critical and controversial topic because of its impact on family and society. The Pharisees themselves were divided on when divorce was permissible. The majority view held that a man could divorce his wife for any reason, including not liking her cooking or even finding another woman more attractive. The minority view held that the Torah had in view sexual misconduct as the only permissible reason. Jesus sided with the minority. The disciples are so taken-aback by Jesus’ response that they exclaim “in that case, it is better not to marry!”\nJesus also teaches about the role of children and we will understand what it means to “become like a child” in order to enter heaven.\nVideo\n   Click to read the complete Gospel Backgrounds commentary   ","date":1641427200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641482613,"objectID":"972a6c0053758a2fd3e7d6aff47b6b86","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/post/across-the-jordan/","publishdate":"2022-01-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/across-the-jordan/","section":"post","summary":"Gospel Backgrounds Lesson 37 is titled “Beyond the Jordan.” We will do this in two parts.\nAfter leaving the Harod Valley [#7 on the map], Jesus makes His way to the Jordan, just south of where it exits the Sea of Galilee.","tags":["Gospels","Jordan","Divorce","Children","Mark 10","Matthew 19","Matthew 20","Luke 18"],"title":"Beyond the Jordan Part I ","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":"Gospel Backgrounds Lesson 36 is titled “Between Samaria and Galilee,” and is taken from Luke 17:11 where we are told Jesus is making his way up to Jerusalem for His final passover and passes between Samaria and Galilee.
