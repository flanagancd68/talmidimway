Our goal is to better understand the cultural, historic, geographic, and linguistic backgrounds of the Gospel’s original characters as well as those for whom the original manuscripts were written.\nThere are 54 lessons in the series that presents the Gospel stories in roughly chronological order.\nChallenges with any Bible Study Our primary obstacle to a complete comprehension of the biblical texts is that we are separated by time an distance.\n TIME  These events happened 2000 years ago, and often referenced events that happened a thousand years before that\n DISTANCE  Israel is around 7000 nautical miles away from the central United States. For the most part has a very different geography and climate than what many of us are used to in North America. It can be surprising how big of a role geography can have on the Gospel narratives.\n  Gospel Backgrounds, which synthesizes several published messianic Jewish, cultural background and geographic commentaries/Bible atlases, as well as extra biblical documents and archaeologic findings, aims to bridge these gaps.\nActs 17:11  Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.^[Unless otherwise indicated, Scripture quotations are from The Holy Bible, English Standard Version. ESV® Text Edition: 2016. Copyright © 2001 by Crossway Bibles, a publishing ministry of Good News Publishers.]\n We will begin every study with Acts 17:11. This verse is paramount for two reasons:\n I, and every other commentator is human. I will of course make every attempt to be faithful and reliable, but we all have our biases, blind spots and faulty conclusions. For this I apologize in advance! The Biblical model is to “trust but verify” - it is up to you, the reader, to do your diligence and make sure facts and conclusions any commentator asserts are scriptural.  Key terms  Anachronism /Anachronistic Fallacy  Misappropriation of concepts and ideas in time\nFor example it is often assumed that Jesus, Paul and other gospel writers preached a new gentile religion.\nHistorically, the Jewish-Gentile split among followers of Jesus did not occur until the very late 1st century at the earliest, and more probably occurred gradually between the 2nd and 4th centuries. Until this time, what we know as “Christianity” was a sect within Judiasm.\nTherefore, since the split had not occurred at the time Jesus was speaking or Paul was writing, there is no way could have have had a new Gentile religion in view.\n Presuppositions  Our set of beliefs we bring with us as we read the text\n Eisegesis  Inserting concepts INTO the Text\nGenerally, we want to avoid, or at list limit, eisegesis. Since we are humans, with thoughts, emotions, presuppositions, and biases, it is nearly impossible to completely eliminate eisegesis as we read the biblical texts.\nThe best course of action is to realize and accept when we are inserting things into the text that are not written and perform Acts 17:11 due diligence on the applicable concept/conclusion.\n Exegesis  Extracting concepts FROM the Text\nExegesis is what we strive for. As with eisegesis, we must perform Acts 17:11 due diligence and make sure these concepts are consistent with the remainder of Scripture.\n  References used   At the conclusion of each lesson a list of works cited will be published. I encourage anyone to never take my word for it but validate what I say. In fact, Chuck Missler used to paraphrase Acts 17:11 as, “don’t believe a word I tell you. Do your own homework and check it out for yourself.”\nI am specifically indebted to Daniel T. Lancaster whose five-volume “Chronicles of the Messiah” is the backbone for Gospel Backgrounds.

John is often viewed as contrasting the correct way of Christianity with the incorrect way of Judaism, but this represents what is called an anachronistic fallacy, often shortened to “Anachronism” - misappropriation of concepts and ideas in time\nWe often see anachronisms in period piece movies. Someone will be wearing a digital watch in a movie set in the 18th century. at the 1955 enchantment under the sea dance, Marty McFly is playing a 1958 gibson guitar.\nIt is a challenge to restrain our own presuppositions, our set of established beliefs, when we read the Bible. It is natural to assume a biblical speaker to affirm our presuppositions in order to justify our positions.\nAn overarching anachronistic fallacy Many commentators commit is to take what is called “the parting of the ways” between Judaism and Christianity that occurred much later (2nd-4th centuries CE) and reading it back into this text in the 1st century.\nIn other words, since it had not occurred yet, there is absolutely no way John or any other biblical writer could have the split between Judaism and Christianity in view when they were writing.\nThis is called eisegesis - reading into the text. Modern conservative scholars would all agree that eisegesis is bad yet many of them do it almost automatically.\nWhat we strive for is EXEGESIS, understanding the text IN CONTEXT to extract what the author was saying. To do this, we must first realize the gospels are Jewish documents written within a historical context of 2nd Temple Judaism. The audience were Jewish Christ followers together with many non-Jews who had joined a Jewish sect..\nThe early church fathers affirmed John’s authorship of this Gospel strongly and unanimously. Some of the fathers claim to have personally known those who knew John in Ephesus in his later years, thus making a direct link to the tradition of Johannine authorship. The evangelist John is shown here with the symbol of an eagle, the one of the four living creatures which is traditionally associated with him (Ezekiel 1:5-10 and Revelation 4:6-7).\nJohn 1:1    John 1     1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.    Logos in the normal sense means “word or speech”. In this prologue, John uses it in the mystical sense. He alludes directly to the beginning of the Torah and the beginning of creation. He starts this with an intentional allusion to Genesis 1:1 “In the beginning”\nJohn 1:2-6    John 1     2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. 6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.    Recall the first act of Creation. “and God said Let there be Light, and there was light.”\nIn verse 4 John declares that this life had always been available through God’s word, which is the same word that he identifies with Jesus (IVP). In John 1:5, The divine light from the first day of creation shines once again into the dark world of man, signifying a new creation (COM)\nThere came a man, sent from God, whose name was John Excavations in the early 2000s revealed this cave west of Jerusalem near Ein Kerem. Archaeologist Shimon Gibson identified it with the ministry of John the Baptist on the basis of a stick-figure drawing of a man inside the cave. Gibson’s theory was published in The Cave of John the Baptist (Doubleday, 2004).\nFor responses, see that by James F. Strange (http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/reviews/the-cave-of-john-the-baptist/) and Todd Bolen (http://www.bibleplaces.com/cave-of-john-the-baptist/).\nSince the writing of the church father Origen (AD 185-254), the location of John’s baptizing at Bethany beyond the Jordan has been located at a point near the river opposite Jericho.\nJohn 1:7    John 1     7 He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him    Some scholars note that John has a “legal” feel. As you read John’s gospel, be on the lookout for the terms Witness, Testimony, and so on.\n Specifically, John is interested not only in establishing Jesus’ credentials, he is also interested in “convicting” the corrupt Jerusalem establishment on the grounds of usurption.\n Discovered in Cave 4 of Qumran in the early 1950s, this text contains five biblical verses that focused on the coming of the Messiah. This artifact was photographed in the Amman Museum.\nA few scholars suspect John may have been part of the Essene sect, but in any case he was definitely influenced by them. The Essenes believed that the forces controlling Jerusalem and the Temple were usurpers and priests of darkness. They juxtaposed darkness and light just as John does throughout his writings. “in the Dead Sea Scrolls, the forces of light and darkness were engaged in …","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"d7af3bedcc2c80669c7f9387298ab186","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/01-the_logos/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/01-the_logos/","section":"commentary","summary":"Video   Introduction The Gospels are Jewish documents. 1st Century “Christianity” was a Jewish sect.

Moreover, they fully believed they were interpreting the Bible faithfully regarding permissible situations for divorce. Jesus is not just going to redirect them back to the Hebrew Bible, not just the Torah, not just Genesis, but Genesis chapter 1 shows God’s intent for marriage. This is why Acts 17:11 must be first and foremost in our study. It’s what Jesus did.\nTopics  Lengthy and Groundbreaking Halacha (Jewish Legal Argument) on Divorce “Better not to marry” Jesus on Children – entering “as a child” “Good Rabbi, what should I do to inherit internal life?” “We have left everything to follow You.” Parable of the Hired Workers “Are you able to drink the up that I drink?”  Many of the topics are probably familiar to us. For example, divorce, and the man who is told to sell everything is sad. Let’s not let our familiarity be an excuse to not ask questions.\nChuck Missler used to say that the greatest obstacle to truth was the assumption you already have it. Missler also used to say, “where two people agree one is redundant.” these are familiar passages with familiar Protestant interpretations that tend to be repeated from one commentator to the next. As usual, the commentators I am using for this series bring added clarity based on their study of the first century legal and cultural backgrounds.\nThere is value in legitimate academic inquiry and applying Acts 17:11.\nAlso, of course, this is a sensitive topic, as many families are affected by divorce.\nPerhaps some of us realize we didn’t act according to the Biblical model for marriage. Or we were a relatively innocent victim of a partner who acted unbiblically. Or maybe there was a legitimate reason other than sexual misconduct.\nAnother good memory verse is Romans 8:1 – there is now, therefore, no condemnation for those who are in Jesus the Messiah.\nWhile these words on divorce may pinch and the practical effects of divorce can’t be minimized, because of who Jesus is and everything he has done on behalf of sinners, you should not feel condemned as long as you are living in unison with Him.\nGeography Jesus has now left the fertile Jezreel and Harod valleys and has most likely crossed the Jordan to make His way down the East Bank towards Jericho. This area, south of the cities of the Decapolis, was Jewish. The terrain is such that water is more plentiful from the numerous brooks on the east side that feed the Jordan. This area is the ancient Gilead, where the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and ½ of Manasseh settled. And we use settled literally and figuratively. They literally settled here (in the sense of settlers) because the land was pleasing to the eye and excellent for raising livestock (which is true). They settled figuratively (in the sense of compromising; settling for less) because God wanted them to Enter and possess the land on the WEST side of the Jordan in the Land of Israel. The “Eastsiders,” as my friend Dan Stolebarger, calls them were usually the first people picked off by armies invading from the North.\nLet’s return to our narrative. At this stage, there is most likely a caravan forming of pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem for the Passover Says Schlegel, “One cannot overstate both the excitement and tension that accompanied Jesus on His way to Jerusalem for the Passover festival. Every question, every word was loaded.” Many other events happened in this region. At Sukkoth, right above where Box 8 is, Jacob built a house and made booths for his cattle. This is where we get the name “sukkot” for the feast of booths, what we might know as the feast of Tabernacles in the fall. Gideon was also in this area in Judges 8 after the rout of the Midinettes. The most notable event was when Joshua led the Israelites across the Jordan on dry ground. When the Israelites crossed the Jordan near Jericho, we are told the waters dried up all the way to Adam (Joshua 3:16), which you can see just below Box 8. God commanded them to set up stones of remembrance in Joshua 4:3. Some scholars speculate that it was those very stones John the Baptist was referring to when he said, “And do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father,’ for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.” (Matthew 3 and Luke 3)\nMatthew 19:1-3 / Mark 10:1-3    Matthew 19 Mark 10     1 Now when Jesus had finished these sayings, he went away from Galilee and entered the region of Judea beyond the Jordan. 2 And large crowds followed him, and he healed them there. 3 And Pharisees came up to him and tested him by asking, “Is it lawful to divorce one’s wife for any cause?” 1 And he left there and went to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan, and crowds gathered …","date":1641513600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641579343,"objectID":"fab95e0939862f71d789dafb79f87c16","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/beyond-the-jordan/","publishdate":"2022-01-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/beyond-the-jordan/","section":"commentary","summary":"Video Part I   Video Part II Coming soon!\nIntroduction  ACTS 17:11 (The Bereans) received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.","tags":[],"title":"37.

The north-south path along the river in this vicinity was along the eastern shore, which the Gospel writers call “Judea beyond the Jordan.” [8]\nJesus will engage a group of inquisitive (but not necessarily trecharous) Pharisees who want to know the Master’s position on divorce. As it is today, divorce was a critical and controversial topic because of its impact on family and society. The Pharisees themselves were divided on when divorce was permissible. The majority view held that a man could divorce his wife for any reason, including not liking her cooking or even finding another woman more attractive. The minority view held that the Torah had in view sexual misconduct as the only permissible reason. Jesus sided with the minority. The disciples are so taken-aback by Jesus\u0026#39; response that they exclaim “in that case, it is better not to marry!”\nJesus also teaches about the role of children and we will understand what it means to “become like a child” in order to enter heaven.\nJesus then receives a question from a “rich, young ruler” about what must be done to inherit eternal life. Jesus responds “Keep the Commandments.” When the man says that he’s done this, Jesus then tells him to sell everything. His response again befuddles the disciples.\nThe section concludes with Jesus receiving a request from James and John to sit at Jesus\u0026#39; right and left hands during the millenial kingdom, which is often portrayed as a great banquet. Instead of rebuking their pride, Jesus explains what it means to sit by his side and “drink His cup”.\n Read the complete Gospel Backgrounds Lesson!
