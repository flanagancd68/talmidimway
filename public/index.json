The north-south path along the river in this vicinity was along the eastern shore, which the Gospel writers call ‚ÄúJudea beyond the Jordan.‚Äù\nJesus will engage a group of inquisitive (but not necessarily trecharous) Pharisees who want to know the Master‚Äôs position on divorce. As it is today, divorce was a critical and controversial topic because of its impact on family and society. The Pharisees themselves were divided on when divorce was permissible. The majority view held that a man could divorce his wife for any reason, including not liking her cooking or even finding another woman more attractive. The minority view held that the Torah had in view sexual misconduct as the only permissible reason. Jesus sided with the minority. The disciples are so taken-aback by Jesus\u0026#39; response that they exclaim ‚Äúin that case, it is better not to marry!‚Äù\nJesus also teaches about the role of children and we will understand what it means to ‚Äúbecome like a child‚Äù in order to enter heaven.\nHe then receives a question from a ‚Äúrich, young ruler‚Äù about what must be done to inherit eternal life. His response again befuddles the disciples.\nThe section concludes with Jesus receiving a request from James and John to sit at Jesus\u0026#39; right and left hands during the millenial kingdom, which is often portrayed as a great banquet. Instead of rebuking their pride, Jesus explains what it means to sit by his side and ‚Äúdrink His cup‚Äù.\nVideo   ","date":1641427200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641482613,"objectID":"972a6c0053758a2fd3e7d6aff47b6b86","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/post/across-the-jordan/","publishdate":"2022-01-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/across-the-jordan/","section":"post","summary":"This week‚Äôs Gospel Backgrounds Lesson is titled ‚ÄúAcross the Jordan.‚Äù After leaving the Harod Valley, Jesus makes His way to the Jordan, just south of where it exits the Sea of Galilee.","tags":["Gospels","Jordan","Divorce","Children"],"title":"Across the Jordan ","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":"This week‚Äôs Gospel Backgrounds Lesson is titled ‚ÄúBetween Samaria and Galilee,‚Äù and is taken from Luke 17:11 where we are told Jesus is making his way up to Jerusalem for His final passover and passes between Samaria and Galilee.
