Our goal is to better understand the cultural, historic, geographic, and linguistic backgrounds of the Gospel’s original characters as well as those for whom the original manuscripts were written.\nThere are 54 lessons in the series that presents the Gospel stories in roughly chronological order. The lessons are grouped into four units:\n Early Ministry (1-11) Beginnings / Genealogies / Nazereth\n  Galilean Ministry (12-27) Capernaum / Sea of Galilee / Caeseara Philippi\n  Late Ministry (28-39) Judea / Samaria / Perea\n  Final Week and Resurrection (39-54) Palm Sunday / Temple Discourses / Last Supper / Gesthemane / Golgotha\n  Challenges with any Bible Study Our primary obstacle to a complete comprehension of the biblical texts is that we are separated by time an distance.\n TIME  These events happened 2000 years ago, and often referenced events that happened a thousand years before that\n DISTANCE  Israel is around 7000 nautical miles away from the central United States. For the most part has a very different geography and climate than what many of us are used to in North America. It can be surprising how big of a role geography can have on the Gospel narratives.\n  To bridge these gaps, Gospel Backgrounds synthesizes several published messianic Jewish, cultural and geographic commentaries/Bible atlases, as well as extra biblical documents and archaeology findings.\nActs 17:11  Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.^[Unless otherwise indicated, Scripture quotations are from The Holy Bible, English Standard Version. ESV® Text Edition: 2016. Copyright © 2001 by Crossway Bibles, a publishing ministry of Good News Publishers.]\n We will begin every study with Acts 17:11. This verse is paramount for two reasons:\n I, and every other commentator is human. I will of course make every attempt to be faithful and reliable, but we all have our biases, blind spots and faulty conclusions. For this I apologize in advance! The Biblical model is to “trust but verify” - it is up to you, the reader, to do your diligence and make sure facts and conclusions any commentator asserts are scriptural.  Key terms  Anachronism /Anachronistic Fallacy  Misappropriation of concepts and ideas in time\nFor example it is often assumed that Jesus, Paul and other gospel writers preached a new gentile religion.\nHistorically, the Jewish-Gentile split among followers of Jesus did not occur until the very late 1st century at the earliest, and more probably occurred gradually between the 2nd and 4th centuries. Until this time, what we know as “Christianity” was a sect within Judiasm.\nTherefore, since the split had not occurred at the time Jesus was speaking or Paul was writing, there is no way could have have had a new Gentile religion in view.\n Presuppositions  Our set of beliefs we bring with us as we read the text\n Eisegesis  Inserting concepts INTO the Text\nGenerally, we want to avoid, or at list limit, eisegesis. Since we are humans, with thoughts, emotions, presuppositions, and biases, it is nearly impossible to completely eliminate eisegesis as we read the biblical texts.\nThe best course of action is to realize and accept when we are inserting things into the text that are not written and perform Acts 17:11 due diligence on the applicable concept/conclusion.\n Exegesis  Extracting concepts FROM the Text\nExegesis is what we strive for. As with eisegesis, we must perform Acts 17:11 due diligence and make sure these concepts are consistent with the remainder of Scripture.\n  References used At the conclusion of each lesson a list of works cited will be published. I encourage anyone to never take my word for it but validate what I say. In fact, Chuck Missler used to paraphrase Acts 17:11 as, “don’t believe a word I tell you. Do your own homework and check it out for yourself.”\nI am specifically indebted to Daniel T. Lancaster whose five-volume “Chronicles of the Messiah” is the backbone for Gospel Backgrounds. The 54 lesson/episode format is from his series. Mr. Lancaster is the director of education for First Fruits of Zion, a messianic Jewish ministry.\nOther sources are as follows:\n Craig T.

John is often viewed as contrasting the correct way of Christianity with the incorrect way of Judaism, but this represents what is called an anachronistic fallacy, often shortened to “Anachronism” - misappropriation of concepts and ideas in time\nWe often see anachronisms in period piece movies. Someone will be wearing a digital watch in a movie set in the 18th century. at the 1955 enchantment under the sea dance, Marty McFly is playing a 1958 gibson guitar.\nIt is a challenge to restrain our own presuppositions, our set of established beliefs, when we read the Bible. It is natural to assume a biblical speaker to affirm our presuppositions in order to justify our positions.\nAn overarching anachronistic fallacy Many commentators commit is to take what is called “the parting of the ways” between Judaism and Christianity that occurred much later (2nd-4th centuries CE) and reading it back into this text in the 1st century.\nIn other words, since it had not occurred yet, there is absolutely no way John or any other biblical writer could have the split between Judaism and Christianity in view when they were writing.\nThis is called eisegesis - reading into the text. Modern conservative scholars would all agree that eisegesis is bad yet many of them do it almost automatically.\nWhat we strive for is EXEGESIS, understanding the text IN CONTEXT to extract what the author was saying. To do this, we must first realize the gospels are Jewish documents written within a historical context of 2nd Temple Judaism. The audience were Jewish Christ followers together with many non-Jews who had joined a Jewish sect..\nThe early church fathers affirmed John’s authorship of this Gospel strongly and unanimously. Some of the fathers claim to have personally known those who knew John in Ephesus in his later years, thus making a direct link to the tradition of Johannine authorship. The evangelist John is shown here with the symbol of an eagle, the one of the four living creatures which is traditionally associated with him (Ezekiel 1:5-10 and Revelation 4:6-7).\nJohn 1:1    John 1     1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.    Logos in the normal sense means “word or speech”. In this prologue, John uses it in the mystical sense. He alludes directly to the beginning of the Torah and the beginning of creation. He starts this with an intentional allusion to Genesis 1:1 “In the beginning”\nJohn 1:2-6    John 1     2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. 6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.    Recall the first act of Creation. “and God said Let there be Light, and there was light.”\nIn verse 4 John declares that this life had always been available through God’s word, which is the same word that he identifies with Jesus (IVP). In John 1:5, The divine light from the first day of creation shines once again into the dark world of man, signifying a new creation (COM)\nThere came a man, sent from God, whose name was John Excavations in the early 2000s revealed this cave west of Jerusalem near Ein Kerem. Archaeologist Shimon Gibson identified it with the ministry of John the Baptist on the basis of a stick-figure drawing of a man inside the cave. Gibson’s theory was published in The Cave of John the Baptist (Doubleday, 2004).\nFor responses, see that by James F. Strange (http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/reviews/the-cave-of-john-the-baptist/) and Todd Bolen (http://www.bibleplaces.com/cave-of-john-the-baptist/).\nSince the writing of the church father Origen (AD 185-254), the location of John’s baptizing at Bethany beyond the Jordan has been located at a point near the river opposite Jericho.\nJohn 1:7    John 1     7 He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him    Some scholars note that John has a “legal” feel. As you read John’s gospel, be on the lookout for the terms Witness, Testimony, and so on.\n Specifically, John is interested not only in establishing Jesus’ credentials, he is also interested in “convicting” the corrupt Jerusalem establishment on the grounds of usurption.\n Discovered in Cave 4 of Qumran in the early 1950s, this text contains five biblical verses that focused on the coming of the Messiah. This artifact was photographed in the Amman Museum.\nA few scholars suspect John may have been part of the Essene sect, but in any case he was definitely influenced by them. The Essenes believed that the forces controlling Jerusalem and the Temple were usurpers and priests of darkness.

It is better not to marry Disciples rebuke children Let the children come to Me    Summary\nJesus receives a question from a group of Pharisees regarding divorce. There were two groups of thought in the early 1st Century. The prevailing view was that divorce was permissible for any justification the husband had. The minority view was that it was only permissible for matters of sexual indiscretion. Jesus responds, generally agreeing with the minority view. His response startles the disciples who exclaim “it is better not to marry”. Jesus responds that in the absence of some physical malformation, one could elect to remain celibate for the sake of the kingdom. The section concludes with the disciples trying keep Jesus safe from crowds, which resulted in preventing little children from accessing Jesus. Jesus corrects the disciples\u0026#39; thinking and says “let the children come to Me.”\nVideo\n  Introduction  ACTS 17:11 (The Bereans) received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.\n In this episode, we’re going to see that as a society, that culture had strayed a bit from God’s original intent. Moreover, they fully believed they were interpreting the Bible faithfully regarding permissible situations for divorce. Jesus is not just going to redirect them back to the Hebrew Bible, not just the Torah, not just Genesis, but Genesis chapter 1 shows God’s intent for marriage. This is why Acts 17:11 must be first and foremost in our study. It’s what Jesus did.\nMany of the topics are probably familiar to us (divorce, and the man who is told to sell everything). Let’s not let our familiarity be an excuse to not ask questions.\nChuck Missler used to say that the greatest obstacle to truth was the assumption you already have it. Missler also used to say, “where two people agree one is redundant.” these are familiar passages with familiar Protestant interpretations that tend to be repeated from one commentator to the next. As usual, the commentators I am using for this series bring added clarity based on their study of the first century legal and cultural backgrounds.\nThere is value in legitimate academic inquiry and applying Acts 17:11.\nNo condemnation\nAlso, of course, this is a sensitive topic, as many families are affected by divorce or are single parents.\nPerhaps some of us realize we haven’t acted according to the Biblical model for marriage. Or we were a relatively innocent victim of a partner who acted unbiblically. Or maybe there was a legitimate reason for our predicament other than our own sexual misconduct.\nAnother good memory verse is Romans 8:1.\n There is now, therefore, no condemnation for those who are in Jesus the Messiah.\n While these words on divorce may pinch and the practical effects of divorce can’t be minimized, because of who Jesus is and everything he has done on behalf of sinners, you should not feel condemned as long as you are living in unison with Him.\nGeography Jesus has now left the fertile Jezreel and Harod valleys and has most likely crossed the Jordan to make His way down the East Bank towards Jericho. This area, south of the cities of the Decapolis, was Jewish. The terrain is such that water is more plentiful from the numerous brooks on the east side that feed the Jordan. This area is the ancient Gilead, where the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and ½ of Manasseh settled. And we use settled literally and figuratively. They literally settled here (in the sense of settlers) because the land was pleasing to the eye and excellent for raising livestock (which is true). They settled figuratively (in the sense of compromising; settling for less) because God wanted them to Enter and possess the land on the WEST side of the Jordan in the Land of Israel. The “Eastsiders,” as my friend Dan Stolebarger, calls them were usually the first people picked off by armies invading from the North.\nLet’s return to our narrative. At this stage, there is most likely a caravan forming of pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem for the Passover. Says Schlegel, “One cannot overstate both the excitement and tension that accompanied Jesus on His way to Jerusalem for the Passover festival. Every question, every word was loaded.” Many other events happened in this region. At Sukkoth, right above where Box 8 is, Jacob built a house and made booths for his cattle. This is where we get the name “sukkot” for the feast of booths, what we might know as the feast of Tabernacles in the fall. Gideon was also in this area in Judges 8 after the rout of the Midinettes. The most notable event was when Joshua led the Israelites across the Jordan on dry ground. When the Israelites crossed the Jordan near Jericho, we are told the waters dried up all the way to Adam (Joshua 3:16), which you can see just below Box 8. God commanded them to set up stones of remembrance in Joshua 4:3. …","date":1641513600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641579343,"objectID":"e93b7f0d3c5fbdcd4306b77bc188459f","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb3/beyond-the-jordan/","publishdate":"2022-01-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb3/beyond-the-jordan/","section":"commentary","summary":"Jesus receives a question regarding divorce, to which He responds with a narrow interpretation.

Jesus says to keep the commandments, sell everything, and follow Him. The man went away sad for he had great wealth. Jesus says it is only through God that a rich man can enter the Kingdom. He then tells His disciples that their sacrifices for the Kingdom will be rewarded. Jesus then tells the parable of the hired workers where the owner pays workers who only worked about an hour the same as those who worked all day, causing the later group to grumble. Jesus again predicts his demise at Jerusalem and says the disciples will also drink his Cup of suffering.\nVideo\n  Geography We are continuing the journey up to Jerusalem for the final Passover. Matthew 20 likely takes place somewhere near Jericho. As they passed through Jericho, there would have been agricultural fields and one of Herod the Great’s palaces.\n In Matthew 19, Jesus tells his talmidim that those who left their fields will receive their rewards. In Matthew 20, Jesus tells a parable about a man who owned a vineyard and needed workers. Later, he will tell His talmidim that once they get to Jerusalem, He will be turned over to the gentiles and the leaders.  It is not too much of a stretch to envision Jesus telling these stories as he passes near and references these geographic markers.\nThe Rich Young Ruler    Matthew 19 Mark 10 Luke 18     16 And behold, a man came up to him, saying, “Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?” 17 And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” 18 And a ruler asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”    Now we meet a man who tends to get the back of the hand from commentators. This treatment may be justified but perhaps not for the typical reasons offered. Let’s see if we can dig deeper.\nFirst, let’s accentuate the positives:\n Note the man RAN to meet Jesus and showed a high degree of respect He assumed the resurrection - we take this for granted, but it was not necessarily a decided issue back then (Pharisees vs. Sadducees) He likely asked other rabbis but was told he’s in the club because he’s Jewish.  _Potentially, something about this answer didn’t satisfy him.   He was a diligent Bible student and attempted to be obedient to the commands  However, when he asks, “What must I do?”, this is our first “tell” that something is off is here.\nWe will learn in a couple of verses that the man was well-versed in the Torah, yet, as Lancaster puts it, “The man had concluded that the words of the Bible we’re not adequate to assure him of the resurrection.”\nWhy do you call me good?    Matthew 19 Mark 10 Luke 18     17 And he said to him, “Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. 18 And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. 19 And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.     What is behind Jesus\u0026#39; initial reaction to being called “good”?  Perhaps the man’s assuming Jesus had some special secret is the underlying motive by Jesus’ adverse reaction to calling him “good.“ Perhaps Jesus is saying, “Do not assume I have something to add to what God has already said.” In Hebrew, the phrase would be HaTov הַטּוֹב, “the good” or “the good one”. This is one of the Hebrew names for God.  Observant Jews do not pronounce the Covenant Holy Name of God (the “Tetragramaton” - four letters) out of respect.  They typically will say “Adonai” (Lord) if in a religious setting They will say “HaShem” (the Name), or another name like “HaTov” if in a less formal context. There is no recorded instance of Jesus using the Covenantal Name of God, but there are MANY examples where He uses a circumlocution, like He does here with “HaTov” I recommend gentile Christians follow Jesus\u0026#39; lead and use a name other than the Tetragramaton when referencing God the Father.        Keep the commandments    Matthew 19 Mark 10 Luke 18     17 If you would enter life, keep the commandments.” 18 He said to him, “Which ones?” 19 You know the commandments: 20 You know the commandments     “Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and mine ordinances; which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am Adonai” (Lev 18:5, ASV).\n  Jesus enhances and clarifies the Torah, but He does add to or subtract from it. Jesus here gives roughly the same answer Abraham gave in Luke 16. “They have Moses and the prophets.“ In other words, the Bible is sufficient and contains the words for eternal life. In Mark and Luke, Jesus is affirming that the young man already has what he needs to know.   Rom 3:28 For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.\n  When Jesus says, “if you would enter life, keep the commandments,” this seems to contradict Paul in Romans 3:28. Note that Jesus does not comment on whether this man or any other man can keep the Law to the degree …","date":1641859200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641940883,"objectID":"b338540596998a514cc5b87a7a3b6d25","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb3/37b-beyond-the-jordan-ii/","publishdate":"2022-01-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb3/37b-beyond-the-jordan-ii/","section":"commentary","summary":"The rich, young ruler and the difficult response from Jesus.

Jesus responds “Keep the Commandments.” When the man says that he’s done this, Jesus then tells him to sell everything. We often think that the young man has a “works righteousness” mindset. This is true to some degree, but notice Jesus\u0026#39; answer. He doesn’t say “to get eternal life, all you need to do is accept Me into your heart.” He says first “keep the commandments,”. Then when pressed further, He says, “sell everything, give it to the poor, then follow Me.” There is a lot more going on then it may first appear. We will take a peek under the hood to get at some of this.\nThe exchange befuddles the disciples. They “remind” Jesus that they HAVE left everything and followed their Rabbi. Jesus assures them that their sacrifices will not go unrewarded.\nMatthew 20 begins with one of my favorite parables, the parable of the workers. A man needs workers for his vineyard. He finds some early in the day, but also at various points throughout the day, including the “11th hour” right before the work is to end. This is possibly where our “at the 11th hour” idiom originates from. When the work is done, the owner calls the workers from last to first and, to the surprise of those hired early, everyone is paid a denarious, a full day’s wage. Those hired early in the day express their belief that this is unfair. How can people who did 1/12 of the work get paid the same as those who did a full day’s work? The owner replies that the first group agreed to the wage, and besides what He does with his money is his business and no one else’s.\nThe parable is rich with meaning and has several applications. We will discuss a few of these in the lesson.\nThe section concludes with Jesus receiving a request from James and John to sit at Jesus\u0026#39; right and left hands during the millenial kingdom, which is often portrayed as a great banquet. Instead of rebuking their pride, Jesus explains what it means to sit by his side and “drink His cup”. This act of presumption, naturally, irks the other ten disciples. Jesus explains that our mission as disciples is not to be serve but to serve.\n Watch the video and read the complete Gospel Backgrounds Lesson!

The north-south path along the river in this vicinity was along the eastern shore, which the Gospel writers call “Judea beyond the Jordan.” [8]\nJesus will engage a group of inquisitive (but not necessarily trecharous) Pharisees who want to know the Master’s position on divorce. As it is today, divorce was a critical and controversial topic because of its impact on family and society. The Pharisees themselves were divided on when divorce was permissible. The majority view held that a man could divorce his wife for any reason, including not liking her cooking or even finding another woman more attractive. The minority view held that the Torah had in view sexual misconduct as the only permissible reason. Jesus sided with the minority. The disciples are so taken-aback by Jesus\u0026#39; response that they exclaim “in that case, it is better not to marry!”\nJesus also teaches about the role of children and we will understand what it means to “become like a child” in order to enter heaven.\n Watch the video and read the complete Gospel Backgrounds Lesson!
