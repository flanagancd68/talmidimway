Our goal is to better understand the cultural, historic, geographic, and linguistic backgrounds of the Gospel’s original characters as well as those for whom the original manuscripts were written.\nThere are 54 lessons in the series that presents the Gospel stories in roughly chronological order. The lessons are grouped into four units:\n Early Ministry (1-11) Beginnings / Genealogies / Nazereth\n  Galilean Ministry (12-27) Capernaum / Sea of Galilee / Caeseara Philippi\n  Late Ministry (28-39) Judea / Samaria / Perea\n  Final Week and Resurrection (39-54) Palm Sunday / Temple Discourses / Last Supper / Gesthemane / Golgotha\n  Challenges with any Bible Study Our primary obstacle to a complete comprehension of the biblical texts is that we are separated by time an distance.\n TIME  These events happened 2000 years ago, and often referenced events that happened a thousand years before that\n DISTANCE  Israel is around 7000 nautical miles away from the central United States. For the most part has a very different geography and climate than what many of us are used to in North America. It can be surprising how big of a role geography can have on the Gospel narratives.\n  To bridge these gaps, Gospel Backgrounds synthesizes several published messianic Jewish, cultural and geographic commentaries/Bible atlases, as well as extra biblical documents and archaeology findings.\nActs 17:11  Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.^[Unless otherwise indicated, Scripture quotations are from The Holy Bible, English Standard Version. ESV® Text Edition: 2016. Copyright © 2001 by Crossway Bibles, a publishing ministry of Good News Publishers.]\n We will begin every study with Acts 17:11. This verse is paramount for two reasons:\n I, and every other commentator is human. I will of course make every attempt to be faithful and reliable, but we all have our biases, blind spots and faulty conclusions. For this I apologize in advance! The Biblical model is to “trust but verify” - it is up to you, the reader, to do your diligence and make sure facts and conclusions any commentator asserts are scriptural.  Key terms  Anachronism /Anachronistic Fallacy  Misappropriation of concepts and ideas in time\nFor example it is often assumed that Jesus, Paul and other gospel writers preached a new gentile religion.\nHistorically, the Jewish-Gentile split among followers of Jesus did not occur until the very late 1st century at the earliest, and more probably occurred gradually between the 2nd and 4th centuries. Until this time, what we know as “Christianity” was a sect within Judiasm.\nTherefore, since the split had not occurred at the time Jesus was speaking or Paul was writing, there is no way could have have had a new Gentile religion in view.\n Presuppositions  Our set of beliefs we bring with us as we read the text\n Eisegesis  Inserting concepts INTO the Text\nGenerally, we want to avoid, or at list limit, eisegesis. Since we are humans, with thoughts, emotions, presuppositions, and biases, it is nearly impossible to completely eliminate eisegesis as we read the biblical texts.\nThe best course of action is to realize and accept when we are inserting things into the text that are not written and perform Acts 17:11 due diligence on the applicable concept/conclusion.\n Exegesis  Extracting concepts FROM the Text\nExegesis is what we strive for. As with eisegesis, we must perform Acts 17:11 due diligence and make sure these concepts are consistent with the remainder of Scripture.\n  References used At the conclusion of each lesson a list of works cited will be published. I encourage anyone to never take my word for it but validate what I say. In fact, Chuck Missler used to paraphrase Acts 17:11 as, “don’t believe a word I tell you. Do your own homework and check it out for yourself.”\nI am specifically indebted to Daniel T. Lancaster whose five-volume “Chronicles of the Messiah” is the backbone for Gospel Backgrounds. The 54 lesson/episode format is from his series. Mr. Lancaster is the director of education for First Fruits of Zion, a messianic Jewish ministry.\nOther sources are as follows:\n Craig T.

We’re essentially going to take a look at significant events in the period between the Jewish Revolt of 66CE, including the destruction of the Jewish Temple in 70, through the mid-90s that resulted in John’s exile on Patmos, where he received the Revelation. Even if history wasn’t your best subject in school, I think you’ll find this helpful as we prepare to study Revelation.\nVideo\n  Introduction Other than Jesus predicting the temple’s destruction in Luke 21, all of this is drawn from extra-biblical sources. Much of it is verifiable from historical documents. Still, some of it is based on church tradition that was likely passed on orally before it was written down several centuries later.\nThe church father, Iraneus, was only one generation removed from John the Apostle. Iraneus in ecclesiastical history¸is the earliest source that tells us that John the Apostle wrote Revelation and did so from Patmos because the Roman Emperor Domitian exiled him.\nDomitian’s persecution turns out to be critically important if we are to put Revelation in context. The following is summarized mainly from Cargill’s Jerusalem the Holy City course1 and Lancaster’s series Apocalypse of John2 and Chronicles of the Apostles3.\n The years following Jesus\u0026#39; Resurrection and Ascension were a tumultuous time for Israel The governors that followed Pontius Pilate went from bad to worse, as did the Herods that took over for Antipas and Phillip, notably Agrippa I and Agrippa II With this came increased talk of rebellion and hopes for a Messianic deliverer In many Jew’s minds, the Messiah will deliver the people from captivity and establish a literal political kingdom, just like Moses did during the Exodus. Since Jesus didn’t do that, He couldn’t be the promised deliverer4. False messiahs were abundant. This led to what is known as the “First Jewish Revolt” in 66 CE.  The Jewish Revolt: Nero, Vespasian, and Josephus  In 66 CE, during the time of Emperor Nero (famous for his own persecutions and insanity), there was open rebellion; a Roman General named Vespasian (pictured at right) was sent with Roman Legions V, X, and XV to quash it. Josephus predicts greatness for Vespasian.  During one battle in the north of Israel, Vespasian captured a Jewish general named Yosef ben Mattiyahu, who later became known as Flavius Josephus. As he was about to be executed, Josephus said to Vespasian something along the lines of, “I’m not really a general. I’m a prophet, and one day you’re going to be the emperor.” Most Roman leaders were extraordinarily superstitious. Naturally, what this man said was pleasing to Vespasian’s ears; therefore, Josephus was allowed to live as an enslaved person. He authored two large volumes of Jewish history up to that point. In 69, while dealing with the Jewish rebellion, Vespasian was recalled to Rome, where he was indeed named emperor. Josephus also told Vespasian that amid all this Jewish messianic enthusiasm, it was Vespasian and his line who fulfilled the Jewish prophecies about the coming Messiah, not some Jewish person from the house of David.  After Vespasian became emperor, they took Jewish prophecies very seriously!   Josephus was still very much in the picture some 10-20 years later, when Vespasian’s son Domitian took over the Roman Empire. Josephus is viewed as a traitor to the Jews for his actions.  According to legend, a group of generals entered into a suicide pact rather than be captured. Josephus conveniently drew the proverbial last straw and was tasked with killing the last man and then himself. He obviously took another way when he presented himself to Vespasian.     Vespasian’s son Titus ultimately was successful in putting down the rebellion.  In 70, he besieged and sacked Jerusalem and destroyed the Temple stone-by-stone, just as Jesus had predicted. In 72, he rooted out the last Jewish holdouts at a place called Masada Those Jews who were not slaughtered were forced into exile The Jews would not have a homeland to call their own until 1948.    2nd Temple Destruction Fulfills Prophecy \rLuke 19:41-44 As He drew near and saw Jerusalem, He wept over her, 42. saying, \u0026#34;If only you had recognized this day the things that lead to shalom! But now they are hidden from your eyes. 43. For the days will come upon you when your enemies will surround you with barricades and hem you in on all sides. 44.

Summary\nWelcome to our series on the book of Revelation we call “Revelation Backgrounds.” In this introductory episode, we will provide an introduction to the book, some background into Jewish Apocalyptic literature, and we’ll provide what we see are Seven Keys to Interpretation. Revelation can be a complex book, but these keys will help assure we get started on the right path.\nVideo\n  “Revelation” (not “Revelations”)  In his course on Jerusalem, Dr. Cargill said, “the name of the book is ‘RevelationnnnnnNUH,\u0026#39;” he said to emphasize the singular1. He continued, “This is a pet peeve of mine. If you call it ‘RevelationS,’ it means you have never read the 1st verse, and I will flunk you.” Of course, we won’t flunk anybody, but this is a good reminder that the correct name of the book is not “Revelations,” but “Revelation.”  What is “Apocalyptic Literature”?  We often think of an apocalypse as some cataclysmic event involving worldwide destruction. From the Greek word apokalupsis, apocalypse means “revealing” or “unveiling.”  Specifically, we would say an unveiling of something not previously known, which wouldn’t be known were it not for divine intervention   In the days of John, there was a significant body of Jewish apocalyptic literature that he and much of his audience would have known2. The general flow of apocalyptic literature:  A person in a “spiritual state,” such as fasting and praying, is caught up to a realm usually unseen by mortals (possibly physically or possibly by way of a vision). He is given a tour, usually guided by an angel, where he sees heavenly worship services, God’s throne, and various hallowed chambers. He also sometimes sees “the war behind the war.”  In other words, when there is a physical war on earth, the person gets to witness a corresponding unseen spiritual warfare.   Then he gets to witness a final climactic battle between the forces of good and evil and resulting judgments. Often, the things the person with the vision sees are nearly impossible to put into words  The best he can do is use the best words he can, Because the human is trying to explain the inexplicable, we end up with the extreme symbolism, such as beasts doing strange things (Daniel 7:5-6) and objects that seem to defy the laws of physics (Ezekiel 1:16-20)     The general purpose of an Apocalypse is for God to reassure His people to remain faithful. Lancaster summarizes a biblical apocalypse like this:  “Although things on earth seem terribly unjust, with the righteous suffering and the wicked prospering, a day is coming where God will pour out his wrath upon the wicked and reward the righteous.” 3 In other words, “your faith and suffering are not in vain.”     The Apocalypse of Paul?

John is often viewed as contrasting the correct way of Christianity with the incorrect way of Judaism, but this represents what is called an anachronistic fallacy, often shortened to “Anachronism” - misappropriation of concepts and ideas in time\nWe often see anachronisms in period piece movies. Someone will be wearing a digital watch in a movie set in the 18th century. at the 1955 enchantment under the sea dance, Marty McFly is playing a 1958 gibson guitar.\nIt is a challenge to restrain our own presuppositions, our set of established beliefs, when we read the Bible. It is natural to assume a biblical speaker to affirm our presuppositions in order to justify our positions.\nAn overarching anachronistic fallacy Many commentators commit is to take what is called “the parting of the ways” between Judaism and Christianity that occurred much later (2nd-4th centuries CE) and reading it back into this text in the 1st century.\nIn other words, since it had not occurred yet, there is absolutely no way John or any other biblical writer could have the split between Judaism and Christianity in view when they were writing.\nThis is called eisegesis - reading into the text. Modern conservative scholars would all agree that eisegesis is bad yet many of them do it almost automatically.\nWhat we strive for is EXEGESIS, understanding the text IN CONTEXT to extract what the author was saying. To do this, we must first realize the gospels are Jewish documents written within a historical context of 2nd Temple Judaism. The audience were Jewish Christ followers together with many non-Jews who had joined a Jewish sect..\nThe early church fathers affirmed John’s authorship of this Gospel strongly and unanimously. Some of the fathers claim to have personally known those who knew John in Ephesus in his later years, thus making a direct link to the tradition of Johannine authorship. The evangelist John is shown here with the symbol of an eagle, the one of the four living creatures which is traditionally associated with him (Ezekiel 1:5-10 and Revelation 4:6-7).\nJohn 1:1    John 1     1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.    Logos in the normal sense means “word or speech”. In this prologue, John uses it in the mystical sense. He alludes directly to the beginning of the Torah and the beginning of creation. He starts this with an intentional allusion to Genesis 1:1 “In the beginning”\nJohn 1:2-6    John 1     2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. 6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.    Recall the first act of Creation. “and God said Let there be Light, and there was light.”\nIn verse 4 John declares that this life had always been available through God’s word, which is the same word that he identifies with Jesus (IVP). In John 1:5, The divine light from the first day of creation shines once again into the dark world of man, signifying a new creation (COM)\nThere came a man, sent from God, whose name was John Excavations in the early 2000s revealed this cave west of Jerusalem near Ein Kerem. Archaeologist Shimon Gibson identified it with the ministry of John the Baptist on the basis of a stick-figure drawing of a man inside the cave. Gibson’s theory was published in The Cave of John the Baptist (Doubleday, 2004).\nFor responses, see that by James F. Strange (http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/reviews/the-cave-of-john-the-baptist/) and Todd Bolen (http://www.bibleplaces.com/cave-of-john-the-baptist/).\nSince the writing of the church father Origen (AD 185-254), the location of John’s baptizing at Bethany beyond the Jordan has been located at a point near the river opposite Jericho.\nJohn 1:7    John 1     7 He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him    Some scholars note that John has a “legal” feel. As you read John’s gospel, be on the lookout for the terms Witness, Testimony, and so on.\n Specifically, John is interested not only in establishing Jesus’ credentials, he is also interested in “convicting” the corrupt Jerusalem establishment on the grounds of usurption.\n Discovered in Cave 4 of Qumran in the early 1950s, this text contains five biblical verses that focused on the coming of the Messiah. This artifact was photographed in the Amman Museum.\nA few scholars suspect John may have been part of the Essene sect, but in any case he was definitely influenced by them. The Essenes believed that the forces controlling Jerusalem and the Temple were usurpers and priests of …","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"d64023209dce473d060a08cbf427e14a","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb1/01-the_logos/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb1/01-the_logos/","section":"commentary","summary":"John 1:1-18","tags":["Gospels","John 1"],"title":"1.

There were two groups of thought in the early 1st Century. The prevailing view was that divorce was permissible for any justification the husband had. The minority view was that it was only permissible for matters of sexual indiscretion. Jesus responds, generally agreeing with the minority view. His response startles the disciples who exclaim “it is better not to marry”. Jesus responds that in the absence of some physical malformation, one could elect to remain celibate for the sake of the kingdom. The section concludes with the disciples trying keep Jesus safe from crowds, which resulted in preventing little children from accessing Jesus. Jesus corrects the disciples\u0026#39; thinking and says “let the children come to Me.”\nVideo\n  Introduction  ACTS 17:11 (The Bereans) received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.\n In this episode, we’re going to see that as a society, that culture had strayed a bit from God’s original intent. Moreover, they fully believed they were interpreting the Bible faithfully regarding permissible situations for divorce. Jesus is not just going to redirect them back to the Hebrew Bible, not just the Torah, not just Genesis, but Genesis chapter 1 shows God’s intent for marriage. This is why Acts 17:11 must be first and foremost in our study. It’s what Jesus did.\nMany of the topics are probably familiar to us (divorce, and the man who is told to sell everything). Let’s not let our familiarity be an excuse to not ask questions.\nChuck Missler used to say that the greatest obstacle to truth was the assumption you already have it. Missler also used to say, “where two people agree one is redundant.” these are familiar passages with familiar Protestant interpretations that tend to be repeated from one commentator to the next. As usual, the commentators I am using for this series bring added clarity based on their study of the first century legal and cultural backgrounds.\nThere is value in legitimate academic inquiry and applying Acts 17:11.\nNo condemnation\nAlso, of course, this is a sensitive topic, as many families are affected by divorce or are single parents.\nPerhaps some of us realize we haven’t acted according to the Biblical model for marriage. Or we were a relatively innocent victim of a partner who acted unbiblically. Or maybe there was a legitimate reason for our predicament other than our own sexual misconduct.\nAnother good memory verse is Romans 8:1.\n There is now, therefore, no condemnation for those who are in Jesus the Messiah.\n While these words on divorce may pinch and the practical effects of divorce can’t be minimized, because of who Jesus is and everything he has done on behalf of sinners, you should not feel condemned as long as you are living in unison with Him.\nGeography Jesus has now left the fertile Jezreel and Harod valleys and has most likely crossed the Jordan to make His way down the East Bank towards Jericho. This area, south of the cities of the Decapolis, was Jewish. The terrain is such that water is more plentiful from the numerous brooks on the east side that feed the Jordan. This area is the ancient Gilead, where the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and ½ of Manasseh settled. And we use settled literally and figuratively. They literally settled here (in the sense of settlers) because the land was pleasing to the eye and excellent for raising livestock (which is true). They settled figuratively (in the sense of compromising; settling for less) because God wanted them to Enter and possess the land on the WEST side of the Jordan in the Land of Israel. The “Eastsiders,” as my friend Dan Stolebarger, calls them were usually the first people picked off by armies invading from the North.\nLet’s return to our narrative. At this stage, there is most likely a caravan forming of pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem for the Passover. Says Schlegel, “One cannot overstate both the excitement and tension that accompanied Jesus on His way to Jerusalem for the Passover festival. Every question, every word was loaded.” Many other events happened in this region. At Sukkoth, right above where Box 8 is, Jacob built a house and made booths for his cattle. This is where we get the name “sukkot” for the feast of booths, what we might know as the feast of Tabernacles in the fall. Gideon was also in this area in Judges 8 after the rout of the Midinettes. The most notable event was when Joshua led the Israelites …","date":1641513600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641579343,"objectID":"e93b7f0d3c5fbdcd4306b77bc188459f","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb3/beyond-the-jordan/","publishdate":"2022-01-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb3/beyond-the-jordan/","section":"commentary","summary":"Jesus receives a question regarding divorce, to which He responds with a narrow interpretation.

Jesus says to keep the commandments, sell everything, and follow Him. The man went away sad for he had great wealth. Jesus says it is only through God that a rich man can enter the Kingdom. He then tells His disciples that their sacrifices for the Kingdom will be rewarded. Jesus then tells the parable of the hired workers where the owner pays workers who only worked about an hour the same as those who worked all day, causing the later group to grumble. Jesus again predicts his demise at Jerusalem and says the disciples will also drink his Cup of suffering.\nVideo\n  Geography We are continuing the journey up to Jerusalem for the final Passover. Matthew 20 likely takes place somewhere near Jericho. As they passed through Jericho, there would have been agricultural fields and one of Herod the Great’s palaces.\n In Matthew 19, Jesus tells his talmidim that those who left their fields will receive their rewards. In Matthew 20, Jesus tells a parable about a man who owned a vineyard and needed workers. Later, he will tell His talmidim that once they get to Jerusalem, He will be turned over to the gentiles and the leaders.  It is not too much of a stretch to envision Jesus telling these stories as he passes near and references these geographic markers.\nThe Rich Young Ruler    Matthew 19 Mark 10 Luke 18     16 And behold, a man came up to him, saying, “Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?” 17 And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” 18 And a ruler asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”    Now we meet a man who tends to get the back of the hand from commentators. This treatment may be justified but perhaps not for the typical reasons offered. Let’s see if we can dig deeper.\nFirst, let’s accentuate the positives:\n Note the man RAN to meet Jesus and showed a high degree of respect He assumed the resurrection - we take this for granted, but it was not necessarily a decided issue back then (Pharisees vs. Sadducees) He likely asked other rabbis but was told he’s in the club because he’s Jewish.  _Potentially, something about this answer didn’t satisfy him.   He was a diligent Bible student and attempted to be obedient to the commands Most importantly, he CAME TO JESUS!  However, when he asks, “What must I do?”, this is our first “tell” that something is off is here.\nWe will learn in a couple of verses that the man was well-versed in the Torah, yet, as Lancaster puts it, “The man had concluded that the words of the Bible we’re not adequate to assure him of the resurrection.”\nWhy do you call me good?    Matthew 19 Mark 10 Luke 18     17 And he said to him, “Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. 18 And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. 19 And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.     What is behind Jesus\u0026#39; initial reaction to being called “good”?  He could be trying to get the young man to see that Jesus = God. Perhaps the man’s assuming Jesus had some special secret is the underlying motive by Jesus’ adverse reaction to calling him “good.“ Perhaps Jesus is saying, “Do not assume I have something to add to what God has already said.” In Hebrew, the phrase would be HaTov הַטּוֹב, “the good” or “the good one”. This is one of the Hebrew names for God.  Observant Jews do not pronounce the Covenant Holy Name of God (the “Tetragramaton” - four letters) out of respect.  They typically will say “Adonai” (Lord) if in a religious setting They will say “HaShem” (the Name), or another name like “HaTov” if in a less formal context. There is no recorded instance of Jesus using the Covenantal Name of God, but there are MANY examples where He uses a circumlocution, like He does here with “HaTov” I recommend gentile Christians follow Jesus\u0026#39; lead and use a name other than the Tetragramaton when referencing God the Father.        Keep the commandments    Matthew 19 Mark 10 Luke 18     17 If you would enter life, keep the commandments.” 18 He said to him, “Which ones?” 19 You know the commandments: 20 You know the commandments     “Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and mine ordinances; which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am Adonai” (Lev 18:5, ASV).\n  Jesus enhances and clarifies the Torah, but He does add to or subtract from it. Jesus here gives roughly the same answer Abraham gave in Luke 16. “They have Moses and the prophets.“ In other words, the Bible is sufficient and contains the words for eternal life. In Mark and Luke, Jesus is …","date":1641859200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641940883,"objectID":"b338540596998a514cc5b87a7a3b6d25","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb3/37b-beyond-the-jordan-ii/","publishdate":"2022-01-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/commentary/gospels/gb3/37b-beyond-the-jordan-ii/","section":"commentary","summary":"The rich, young ruler and the difficult response from Jesus.

In Luke, Jesus also gives the double-parable of the Minas (Pounds) and the King’s Return.\nThe lesson begins with Jesus passing through Jericho on His way up to Jerusalem for the Passover. What Jesus knew, and what we, the readers, know, but what the disciples and others at the scene did not know is that this would be the final stop of His earthly ministry. The most tumultuous and historically significant week in all of human history was about to begin, but first Jesus continues His mission to seek and save the lost sheep of Israel.\nVideo\n  Geography    Matthew 20 Mark 10 Luke 18     29. As they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him. 46. And they came to Jericho. And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd… 35. As he drew near Jericho…    Notes:1 2\nThe fact that Matthew and Mark say they were leaving Jericho, while Luke says they were drawing near Jericho need not concern us. Dr. Bolen writes, “it is apparent that Jesus was leaving the population center of Jericho (as recorded in Matthew) and entering the area of the Herodian city (as recorded in Luke).”3\nThis lesson takes place in and around the city of Jericho. Jericho is only about 15 miles from Jerusalem, but they couldn’t be more opposite in many ways.\n Jericho lies deep in the Jordan Rift Valley, around 900 feet below sea level.  Compare this to Jerusalem, high in the Judean hills at about 2500 feet above sea level4.   In Jericho, freshwater is plentiful from the many springs. It is known as the “city of palms” because it is very much an oasis in the desert.  Jerusalem’s only source of freshwater, the Gihon Spring, can only provide water for a few thousand people per year.   Jericho commands the central east-west approach to Jerusalem, making it strategically important.  The Jordan was relatively easy to cross near Jericho. This factor contributed to the wealth of Zacchaeus, the tax collector who was able to tax people coming and going. Despite having tremendous religious importance, Jerusalem is neither strategic nor wealthy.     More Jericho Background Empires from the Persians to the Romans used Jericho as an administrative center. Alexander the Great had a private estate here. Mark Antony gave Jericho to Cleopatra as a gift. As we noted last time, Herod the Great had a palace here, which would still have been in use as Jesus made His way through the city. Much like he did with Jerusalem, Herod expanded his “footprint” in the city with several public works, military buildings, a hippodrome/theatre complex to entertain the masses, and of course, his lavish private palace.\nIn Israel’s history, we know that Jericho is significant for being the first town Joshua and the Israelites could capture using a unique battle plan. Of significance for us is the town of Gilgal. This is where God made the Israelites stop, get circumcised (a very odd thing to do before a battle!), sanctify themselves, and celebrate Passover (Joshua 5:1-12).\nGoing back even further, archeologists have unearthed artifacts that date to ~8000 BCE in the new stone age period – that’s 6000 years before Abraham. Historians believe Jericho is the oldest, continuously inhabited city in the world.\n\r   The setting here is a little over a week before Passover. Crowds are beginning to swell. The beginning of the narrow Ascent of Adummim would have represented a bottleneck, with people backing into Jericho. Additionally, primarily, but perhaps not exclusively due to Jesus, the expectation grew for a Messianic deliverer. Such hope is always higher around Passover, as the feast recalls Israel’s miraculous deliverance from oppressive Egypt. Those who realized God sent Jesus had every reason to think a similar redemption was at hand.  Blind Bartimaeus  Mat 20:29-34 Mar 10:46-52 Luk 18:35-43     Matthew 20 Mark 10 Luke 18     29.

And behold, two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!” 31.

He wrote 13 letters, three of which were written to pastors and three of them have two letters. If we exclude those written to pastors and combine those who received two letters, we are left with (wait for it…) seven!

Generally, mustard plants only grow to a few feet tall - one in which the birds of the air (also typically evil) could lodge would mean it’s become a monstrosity.

They followed their flesh instead of God.   4 Thyatria Woman \u0026amp; Leaven Assuming the leaven is also used negatively in Matthew 13 (as leaven usually represents sin in the Old Testament), Jezebel contaminates the community just like the woman with leaven introduces sin into the batch   5 Sardis Treasure in Field The treasure is hidden.

Lancaster’s commentary is a five-volume set. Each volume has around 400 pages. The Triumphal entry occurs about ½ way into volume 4. In other words, even though it looks like we’re nearing the end from a timeline perspective, we have a LOT of Gospel still ahead of us. Our format will take another 14 lessons to cover the events in the eight calendar days between Palm Sunday and Resurrection Sunday.\nThis is undoubtedly the most influential and most personally significant week in all of history.\n   Luke 19:28     And when he had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.    The “these things” are the Minas and the King’s Returning parables we studied in Lesson 38.\nThis photo1 shows the ancient path that led the 18 miles (29 km) up from Jericho to Jerusalem. One always goes “up to Jerusalem.”\nThis chart comes from AD Riddle2 and shows Herod’s palace, Jericho, to Jerusalem. Presumably, the -720 is from the Herodian Palaces, west of the modern city and slightly higher. Modern Jericho’s height is listed at -864 feet, making it the lowest and the oldest continuously inhabited city on Earth. Today much of the Kidron valley has been filled in, so the elevation difference between that and Jerusalem is not as significant. Still, one had to be in excellent physical shape to make this trek. Today we do it in an air-conditioned bus with Wi-Fi.\nThe beginning of the Following the Messiah episode 8 has an excellent segment about this ascent. Watch through 8:55.\n  Will he come to the feast?    John 11:55-57     55 Now, the Passover of the Ioudaioi was at hand, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves. 56 They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, “What do you think? That he will not come to the feast at all?” 57 Now, the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, he should let them know so that they might arrest him.    In the week leading up to Passover, Jerusalem would swell with Pilgrims. By some estimates, a population of perhaps a few hundred thousand could swell to 2-3 million. This helps explain several dynamics, most notably why the city’s leadership (both the Romans and the temple establishment) might be more on edge. It also makes locating one person in that crowd a non-trivial task.Ceremonial purification could take up to a week, especially if that person had come into contact with a corpse (Numbers 19). The Jewish Sages applied those same standards to any Jew living in a foreign country – gentile nations are inherently unclean. Remember this point when we get to Acts. This notion of ceremonial uncleanliness has a lot to do with the disciples\u0026#39; attitudes and reticence concerning dining with non-Jews.\nThey were looking for Jesus, meaning the people were wondering whether He would claim his Messianic title. The Passover/Feast of Unleavened bread was compulsory, so it would be very unusual for Him not to show up, especially since He only had to travel a relatively short distance from Galilee.\nThe public didn’t realize that “the game’s afoot,” as Sherlock Holmes might say. The Jerusalem “deep state”\u0026#34; had already decreed that Jesus needed to be taken out.\n A Passover Seder If you get a chance to participate in a Passover Seder, you should take advantage of it. It is rich with Symbolism and Biblical history. Christians/Messianic Jews see additional symbolism that represents Jesus. For example, there are traditionally three pieces of Matzah wafers. The way it is baked, it has holes (like saltine crackers) and stripes.

The next seven days are a roller coaster of emotions, ending on the highest peak of all, the Resurrection.\nLesson 39 will be in two parts. Part I will review the Ascent of Adummim, which connects Jericho to Jerusalem. We’ll meet up with Jesus and the recently resurrected Lazarus in Bethany, look at how Jesus procures a donkey for his entry into Jerusalem, and examine the crowd’s reaction as they welcomed Jesus.\nThe lesson begins with Jesus and His talmidim leaving Jericho to make the 18-mile journey to Jerusalem. We can recreate this journey when we go to Israel (albeit from an air-conditioned bus with wi-fi). Although 18 miles is not that far, the elevation gain is steep, so one had to be in excellent physical shape to do it on foot. As the “Following the Messiah” hosts point out, it would be challenging to do that strenuous hike and carry on a conversation simultaneously. What was going through Jesus\u0026#39; mind, knowing what would happen? What was going through the disciples\u0026#39; minds, wondering what would happen?\nNext, in John, we have the Ioudaioi wondering whether Jesus would come to the feast? This is an odd thought, as attendance at the feast was compulsory for all able-bodied Jewish men. In John 11:56-57, John distinguishes the “Ioudaioi” and the “chief priests and the Pharisees.” Not all “Jews” (Ioudaioi) were in on the plot, and we also know that not all Pharisees were in on the plot either (Nicodemus, for one). If we keep reading in John 12:9-11, we see that many Ioudaioi were “believing in Jesus.” This was because of Lazarus\u0026#39; testimony.\nWe assume Jesus spends Shabbat (Friday sundown to Saturday sundown) with Mary, Martha, and Lazarus (John may be indicating this in John 12:2-8). Then on Sunday morning, Jesus gives instructions to procure a donkey. We briefly discuss whether this represents a prophecy or whether Jesus was taking advantage of the hospitality system of that day (perhaps combined with His familiarity with the area). Just as with the beggars in Jericho, Matthew says “a colt and his mother,” whereas Mark and Luke focus only on the “colt.” Matthew occasionally says there were two of something when Luke/Mark focuses on the more significant one (perhaps this is a result of his former job as a tax collector!).\rThe Triumphal entry is a big deal for one primary reason. Every other time before this, when the people wanted to anoint Jesus as their leader, He said, “my hour has not yet come.” Now, Jesus not only permits it, but He also arranges it in a way that has direct parallels to Solomon, another “son of David.” He would ride a donkey into Jerusalem, indicating that he comes not as a conqueror but in peace.\nThe crowds shout “Hosanna” (Hebrew for “save us now” or “save us please!\u0026#34;) and wave palm branches, which was a direct allusion to the days of the Maccabees, who defeated the Seleucid Greeks in 166 BCE. In other words, they were encouraging Jesus to take over politically. They also chant Psalms 118, another messianic reference. It was unmistakable that they were crowning Jesus as the messiah, which Jesus is Ok with (Luke 19:40) . The problem is (to borrow a quote), “this is not the messiah you’re looking for.”\nTo close the lesson, we look at the “cheapest souvenir in Israel.” When the Pharisees heard the people chanting that Psalm in THAT circumstance, they feared reprisal from the leadership, this is one indication that these Pharisees were not against Jesus but were on his side. They simply feared for his safety.\rJesus said, “If these kept quiet, the very stones would cry out.” So the cheapest souvenir is to bring home one of the stones that didn’t cry out.\nPart II will continue with Jesus weeping over Jerusalem, a precise prophecy that would be fulfilled around 40 years later, and other activities in the Temple.\nRead/Listen to the portions window.ESV_CROSSREF_OPTIONS = {\rbody_background_color: \u0026#39;D7E5F0\u0026#39;, header_font_size: 10, body_font_size: 14, footer_font_size: 8, body_font_family: \u0026#39;Times\u0026#39; };\r  Matthew 21:1-17 Mark 11:1-11 Luke 19:28-40 John 11:55-12:1, John 12:9-16  Note: There is a known textual problem with John 12:2-8, which we will discuss when we get to Matthew 26.\nWatch the videos Gospel Backgrounds Lesson Video:   The beginning of the Following the Messiah episode 8 has an excellent segment about the Triumphal Entry.

Revelation can be a complex book, but these keys will help assure we get started on the right path.\nWhile many commentators focus on what Revelation may mean to us living in the 21st Century, very few Protestant commentators take the time to understand the historical, first-century context. Revelation, as it turns out, is the most Jewish book in the New Testament. There are over 800 allusions to the Old Testament in the book’s 404 verses. The reasons many people struggle with the book is because we ignore its Jewishness.\nWe have developed “Seven Keys to Interpretation,” which we will discuss in the lesson.\n Follow the “Talmidim Way” - We want to learn to walk in the dust of Yeshua our Rabbi just as His original Talmidim, His disciples such as John did. Be open to the Spirit’s leading - Understanding what God wants us to learn is way more important that making sure others know our beliefs Be a Berean - Check everything out against scripture. If our interpretation doesn’t fit, it might be something we need to discard. Understand the intended audience - They were Jewish, or if they were gentiles, they were worshipping in a Jewish setting, which would have almost nothing in common with our western protestant churches today Revelation is a Jewish Book - For every verse in Revelation there is a 2:1 ratio of Old Testament illusions. If we try to understand Revelation without this background, we’ll be lost. With it, we’ll be much better off Be suspicious if an interpretation does not fit the original context - that is to say, if it could not have been within the realm of possibility for John or the original audience. This is not to say that the book can’t have multiple layers of interpretation, but for our historical and cultural approach, we want to start by making sure it’s something that would have made sense to the original audience. No fear allowed - While books and websites present the events of Revelation as something that should scare an unbeliever (and they probably should be scared), fear has no place in a believer’s heart.  We will also look at who wrote the book and some other details:\n Who wrote Revelation? John the Apostle. We don’t have 100% concrete proof, but the earliest and best evidence suggests it was none other than John, the author of the Gospel and three letters that bear his name. Where was it written? Patmos, which is an island some 35 miles off the coast of Turkey. Revelation 1:9 is our source for this. When was it written? Most conservative scholars land on 90-95 of the Common Era. Iraneus is the earliest source for this information. He was a disciple of Polycarp, who was a disciple of John. Iraneus states John received the relevation during the time of Emperor Domitian. How was Revelation given? Signs and Patterns! Revelation 1:1 contains the Greek word σημαίνω, which literally means “rendered into signs.” Every sign in the Bible points to something. Every sign in Revelation points to a verse (sometimes more than one) in the Old Testament. The pattern of the number seven is also quite conspicuous. Sevens are everywhere in Revelation. Since sevens are also conspicuous throughout the entire Bible, this is often seen as the “fingerprints of the Holy Spirit.” To whom was Revelation written? The seven messianic congregations in Asia Minor.. We are told this in Revelation 1:4. Note that although your Bible may say “seven churches,” the “church” either as a building or an organization did not exist when Revelation was given. We need to avoid what is called an anachronistic fallacy. See the lesson detail for more information. Why was Revelation written? The Hope of HIS RETURN and the Restoration of all things!

Revelation Backgrounds","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":"This lesson is titled “Zacchaeus and Bartimaeus” because of the healings, one physical and one spiritual of Blind Bartimaeus and Zacchaeus, the wealthy tax collector. In Luke, Jesus also gives the double-parable of the Minas (Pounds) and the King’s Return. The lesson begins with Jesus passing through Jericho on His way up to Jerusalem for the Passover, where we are presented with two potential textual problems.\n Matthew says they were leaving Jericho, while Mark/Luke says they drew near to Jericho. Matthew says there were two beggars, while Mark/Luke list only one.  Both tensions are easily reconciled and need not distract us from the core teachings of the passage. There are several lessons for us with the healing of Bartimaeus.\nLuke alone tells the story of Zacchaeus, the repentant tax collector. Zacchaeus would have been extremely wealthy, but mainstream Jewish society viewed tax collectors as outcasts. To his credit, he wanted to see Jesus, and, as it turns out, Jesus wanted to see him. Zacchaeus was likely less than five feet tall, so he decided to climb a Sycamore tree to get a better view. Jesus notices the man in the tree, then says He “must” stay with him. Apparently, without any prompting from Jesus, Zacchaeus pledges to give half his goods to the poor. To the extent he defrauded anyone (which he did), he promised to repay with 4x damages. Jesus tells him, “Today salvation has come.” Jesus chose to honor an outcast, and he repented.\nLuke concludes this section with Jesus telling (but not explaining) two parables. Both fall into the category of “Journey parables.” With these parables in Luke 19, Luke makes it a point to tell us that Jesus told the parables “BECAUSE they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.” So whatever interpretation and application we come up with, it must connect somehow to the fact that (as we, the readers, know) the Messianic Kingdom did NOT appear immediately.\nWhat is curious about these parables is that Jesus deliberately compares the King-on-a-journey to the hated and wicked Herod Archelaus. Archelaus was so bad even the Romans got rid of him. So, the reader is presented with a curious question: if Jesus is allegorically speaking of Himself as the King in the parables, why would He so obviously compare Himself to the wicked Archelaus?\nThe video and lesson detail will explore some plausible interpretations and applications of these parables, including one that we might say goes against the grain of our typical expectations. We’ll don our “Acts 17:11 thinking caps” to work through these.\nThe lesson concludes with Luke writing, “when He had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.” In the next lesson, we will examine the Triumphal Entry, which is the first of the most significant seven days in all human history.\nRead/hear the portions window.ESV_CROSSREF_OPTIONS = {\rbody_background_color: \u0026#39;D7E5F0\u0026#39;, header_font_size: 10, body_font_size: 14, footer_font_size: 8, body_font_family: \u0026#39;Times\u0026#39; };\r  Matthew 20:29-34 Mark 10:46-52 Luke 18:35-19:38 (Primary)  Watch the video   Study the context  Click to read the complete Gospel Backgrounds lesson   ","date":1642636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642085878,"objectID":"7ee39e341789de6b5ab7e9ce5758375a","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/post/38-zaccheaus-and-bartimaus/","publishdate":"2022-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/38-zaccheaus-and-bartimaus/","section":"post","summary":"This lesson is titled “Zacchaeus and Bartimaeus” because of the healings, one physical and one spiritual of Blind Bartimaeus and Zacchaeus, the wealthy tax collector.

We often think that the young man has a “works righteousness” mindset - in other words, if a person has enough good deeds, he or she will merit eternal salvation. This is true to some degree, but notice Jesus\u0026#39; answer.\nHe doesn’t say “to get eternal life, all you need to do is accept Me into your heart.” In response to the immediate question, Jesus says first “keep the commandments”. Then when pressed further, He says, “one thing you lack: sell everything, give it to the poor, then follow Me.”\nNote that Jesus doesn’t rebuke the young man about being self-righteous, nor does Jesus correct the man’s errant theology. The man had a heart issue, not a head issue. There is a lot more going on with this exchange than it may first appear. We will take a peek under the hood to get at some of the lessons for our lives.\nThe exchange befuddles the disciples. They “remind” Jesus that they HAVE left everything and followed their Rabbi as His talmidim. Jesus assures them that their sacrifices will not go unrewarded.\nMatthew 20 begins with one of my favorite parables, the parable of the workers. A man needs workers for his vineyard. He finds some early in the day, but also at various points throughout the day, including at the “11th hour” right before the work is to end.\nWhen the work is done, the owner calls the workers from last to first and, to the surprise of those hired early, everyone is paid a denarious, a full day’s wage. Those hired early in the day gripe that this is unfair. Is is right that someone who did 1/12 of the work get paid the same as those who did a full day’s work? The owner replies that the first group agreed to the wage, and besides what He does with his money is his business and no one else’s.\nThe parable is rich with meaning and has several practical and spiritual applications. We will discuss a few of these in the lesson.\nThe section concludes with Jesus receiving a request from James and John to sit at Jesus\u0026#39; right and left hands during the millennial kingdom, which is often portrayed as a great banquet. Instead of rebuking their pride, Jesus explains what it means to sit by his side and “drink His cup”. This act of presumption, naturally, irks the other ten disciples. Jesus explains that our mission as disciples is not to be serve but to serve.\nRead/Listen to the portions window.ESV_CROSSREF_OPTIONS = {\rbody_background_color: \u0026#39;D7E5F0\u0026#39;, header_font_size: 10, body_font_size: 14, footer_font_size: 8, body_font_family: \u0026#39;Times\u0026#39; };\r  Matthew 19:16-20:28 Mark 10:17-45 Luke 18:18-34  Watch the video   Study the context  Click to read the complete Gospel Backgrounds lesson   ","date":1642032000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642085878,"objectID":"8ab4011f933f247aa89a4884bc3db3a0","permalink":"https://talmidimway.com/post/beyond-the-jordan-part-ii/","publishdate":"2022-01-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/beyond-the-jordan-part-ii/","section":"post","summary":"This is part II of the Gospel Backgrounds lesson titled, “Beyond the Jordan.”\nTo begin the lesson, Jesus receives a question from a “rich, young ruler” about what must be done to inherit eternal life.","tags":[],"title":"Beyond the Jordan Part II","type":"post"},{"authors":["Chris Flanagan"],"categories":["Gospel Backgrounds"],"content":"Gospel Backgrounds Lesson 37 is titled “Beyond the Jordan.” We will do this in two parts.\nAfter leaving the Harod Valley [#7 on the map], Jesus makes His way to the Jordan, just south of where it exits the Sea of Galilee.

As it is today, divorce was a critical and controversial topic because of its impact on family and society. The Pharisees themselves were divided on when divorce was permissible. The majority view held that a man could divorce his wife for any reason, including not liking her cooking or even finding another woman more attractive. The minority view held that the Torah had in view sexual misconduct as the only permissible reason. Jesus sided with the minority.
