      <title>Caesarea Philippi</title>
      <link>https://talmidimway.com/sites/galilee-north/cesphil/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1-min Devo:

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/NIWgfj4P4PI&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one event in the New Testament takes place at Caesarea Philippi.  Jesus brought His talmidim here to a notoriously pagan and wicked area to give them a test.  He wanted to see whether they were ready for the grueling physical and emotional journey that lay ahead. If you know the story in Matthew 16 when Jesus asked, “Who do you say I am?” Peter gave the correct answer, a beautiful confession of Jesus as Messiah. However, when Messiah said He must suffer, Peter’s actions revealed he had not fully submitted, resulting in a scolding by Jesus. We might say Peter got an A on the theory part but failed the practical portion of the exam.  Often, we’re the same way.  If we’re asked a fundamental question about our faith, saying the correct answer is often easier than living out those words.  Beautiful Caesarea Philippi reminds us to live out our faith every day in our deeds as well as our words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Videos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis Intro &amp;amp; 1:1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0TN3BQs7b30&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;genesis-background-and-11&#34;&gt;Genesis Background and 1:1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;acts-1711&#34;&gt;Acts 17:11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will begin every study with Acts 17:11. This verse is paramount for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I and every other commentator am human. I will of course make every attempt to be faithful and reliable, but we all have our biases, blind spots, and faulty conclusions. For this, I apologize in advance!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Biblical model is to “trust but verify” - it is up to you, the reader, to do your diligence and make sure the facts and conclusions any commentator asserts are scriptural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;blessing-for-torah-study&#34;&gt;Blessing for Torah Study&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Parsons writes, “it is customary to recite a blessing before engaging in the study of Torah”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; so let’s do this now: This is an abbreviation of a prayer said in the synagogue before studying Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessed are you, LORD God, King of the universe who sanctifies us and commanded us to immerse ourselves in the words of Torah. Lord, please sweeten the words of your Torah in our mouths. Blessed are you Lord, giver of the Torah. Amen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;challenges-with-any-bible-study&#34;&gt;Challenges with any Bible Study&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our primary obstacle to a complete comprehension of the biblical texts is that we are separated by time and distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIME&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;These events happened 2000 years ago, and often referenced events that happened a thousand years before that&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISTANCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Israel is around 7000 nautical miles away from the central United States.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;For the most part, Israel has a very different geography and climate than what many of us are used to in North America.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be surprising how big of a role geography can have on the biblical narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To bridge these gaps, Talmidim Way synthesizes several published messianic Jewish, cultural, and geographic commentaries/Bible atlases, as well as extra-biblical documents and archaeology findings. A list of the references we will be using specifically for our backgrounds studies in Genesis is discussed in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start every new study with a review of other terms we need to be familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anachronism /Anachronistic Fallacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misappropriation of concepts and ideas in time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presuppositions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our set of beliefs we bring with us as we read the text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eisegesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inserting concepts INTO the Text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These concepts are generally influenced by our presuppositions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exegesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracting concepts FROM the Text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, it is often assumed that Jesus, Paul, and other gospel writers preached a new gentile religion. This is a &lt;strong&gt;presupposition&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we read the Old Testament, we often subconsciously apply this filter. As we read the text, we may find ourselves saying something along the lines of “that was for the Jews only, it’s not for us today because Jesus did away with the Law.” This is &lt;strong&gt;eisegesis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that, historically, the Jewish-Gentile split among followers of Jesus did not occur until the very late 1st century at the earliest and more probably occurred gradually between the 2nd and 4th centuries. Paul continued to keep Torah well after his Damascus Road experience. Therefore, our presupposition is faulty because it is an &lt;strong&gt;anachronistic fallacy&lt;/strong&gt;. The concepts we inserted into the text are flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, many parts of the law are only for Jews and not gentile believers in Jesus, but possibly not as much as we might think. The historical truth is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Torah is a Jewish document that was taken VERY SERIOUSLY by the early church, which was a sect of Jews that operated wholly under the umbrella of Judaism of their time. To best understand what Moses was communicating, we need to view the words through this lens and let the text speak to us (Exegesis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ALL have presuppositions, and some amount of eisegesis is unavoidable. After all, we are humans with thoughts, emotions, and biases, it is nearly impossible to completely eliminate eisegesis as we read the biblical texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I’m assuming most of us are approaching the early chapters of Genesis as followers of Jesus from a conservative, evangelical, or fundamentalist branch of the faith who place a high degree of confidence in the accuracy of the accounts given, particularly in Genesis 1-11. Evangelicals are bringing this presupposition with them and therefore, are going to have less issue with a seven-day creation as the Bible describes it than Someone from a more liberal Christian tradition, who is more likely to view these chapters allegorically. A person who is brand new to the faith might not have made up his or her mind on whether the narrative is historically reliable. Someone who has lived life with an evolutionary/secular humanist worldview is likely to treat the opening chapters as nothing more than fanciful myths and legends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best course of action is to realize and accept when we are inserting things into the text that are not written and perform Acts 17:11 due diligence on the applicable concept/conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exegesis is what we strive for. We must perform Acts 17:11 due diligence and make sure these concepts are consistent with the remainder of Scripture, and to the extent possible, consistent with what the original audience would have understood the narrative to mean. To help 21st-century mainstream Christians with this context is precisely why the ministry of Talmidim Way exists!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;references-used&#34;&gt;References used&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:50%;float:right&#34; /&gt;Our goal is to peer into some cultural, historical, and geographical backgrounds, which in the case of Genesis means referencing several Messianic and Traditional Jewish commentaries as well as mainstream Christian discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our primary reference will be the Bible, particularly any New Testament cross-references and allusions. Genesis is quoted over 200 times in the New Testament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two commentaries are Jesus centered Messianic Jewish commentaries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadows of the Messiah reviews Jewish literature and calls out different points in the text where the Jewish sages commented that the verse spoke of or alluded to messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unrolling the Scroll is an overview commentary of the Torah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love your Neighbor is a traditional Jewish text that examines verses in the Torah that have an application to Leviticus 19:18 and the command to Love your neighbor as yourself, a command that should be very important to us as disciples of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, no bible study of mine would be complete without maps. Where applicable, we’ll bring in maps from the Satellite Bible Atlas – this will be more applicable when we get to Abraham’s Journey’s in Chapter 12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll also have a few other miscellaneous commentaries from Chuck Missler, Keren Pryor (wife of the late Dwight Pryor), and John Parsons who has a terrific website called hebrew4christians.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-to-the-old-testament&#34;&gt;Introduction to the Old Testament&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-is-the-hebrew-bible-different-from-our-old-testament&#34;&gt;How is the Hebrew Bible different from our Old Testament?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew Bible (the Bible used by the Jewish community) has the same books as the Protestant Old Testament, but they are in a slightly different order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They call their Bible the “Tanakh.” &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;a&lt;strong&gt;n&lt;/strong&gt;a&lt;strong&gt;k&lt;/strong&gt;h is an acronym.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;orah (teaching) – the first five books of Moses, same as the Christian Bible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N&lt;/strong&gt;evi’im (prophets) –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Jewish Bible, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings are called “former prophets” while books Christians typically think of as prophecy are called “latter prophets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latter prophets are divided between major (greater) and minor (lessor) – this refers to size of the book, not its importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major: Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minor: Hosea through Malachi in the same order as the Christian Bible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K&lt;/strong&gt;etuvim (writings)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wisdom: Psalm, Proverbs, Job (Christian order is Job first)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megillot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megillah is a scroll; megillot is plural, “scrolls”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five books of the Megillot are read on specific festival days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Song of Songs (Passover), Ruth (Shavuot/Pentecost), Lamentations (9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of Av), Ecclesiastes (Sukkot), and Esther (Purim)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Histories: Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, Chronicles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the content of the books is the same, the chapter and verse references are not always identical between the Hebrew and Christian Bibles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observant Jews (traditional and Messianic) as well as an increasing number of Christians read through the Torah every year following the weekly Torah reading schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Act 15:21 “For from ancient generations Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him, for he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The schedule is standardized throughout the Jewish community, and follows the course of a Jewish year (usually beginning each October (or sometimes late September) after the feast of Sukkot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weekly section is called a Torah portion or a parasha in Hebrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 54 parashot across the Torah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As most Hebrew years have 48 weeks, not 54, certain weeks have double portions (usually the portions are noticeably shorter)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portion is studied during the week and then read aloud during Shabbat services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A portion from the Nevi’im is also read, which is called the haftara (no relation to the word Torah)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tradition of weekly reading goes back to Ezra and we suspect that when Jesus stood up to read from Isaiah in the Synagogue in Luke 4:16, he was reading that week’s haftara portion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re wondering what this week’s Torah portion is, check out the Bible Reading Schedule on talmidimway.org.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we move through Genesis, we’ll try to make a note of what Parasha we are in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of the twelve portions, six correspond with chapter breaks and six do not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-is-the-torah-organized&#34;&gt;How is the Torah Organized?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all Hebrew words have a verbal root, which can give some insight as to the word’s meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torah comes from the verb yarah meaning to shoot an arrow, or possibly to flow, as in the way water in a river flows.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although usually translated as “law” in English, the word carries the sense of teaching or instruction, specifically divine instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Torah is much more than a list of laws and do’s and don’ts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Torah is God’s revealed will for his people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Paul says, 2Ti 3:16-17 All Scripture is God-breathed and is valuable for teaching the truth, convicting of sin, correcting faults and training in right living; [17] thus anyone who belongs to God may be fully equipped for every good work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was no “Tew Testament” in Paul’s day, so the Scripture he refers to is the Tanach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to say “Torah” instead of “law” whenever you encounter the word in the New Testament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the content of the books is the same, the five books of Moses have different names in the Hebrew Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The naming system is quite simple – the first descriptive Hebrew word in verse 1 of each book is the name of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bereshit – In the beginning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of creation, the dividing of the nations, and the calling of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exodus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shemot – Names&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God delivers His people out of Egypt and establishes a covenantal relationship with them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leviticus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vayikra – And He called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instructions for how His people should behave with each other and interact with their God. Holiness is a major theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know God’s will, read Leviticus (the enemy will tell you this book has no value to a Christian, yet in traditional Jewish schooling, it is the first book a five or six-year-old Jewish child learns).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numbers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamidbar – In the wilderness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successes and failures of the people of Israel in the wilderness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteronomy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devarim – Words, Matters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often considered Moses’ farewell sermon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessings for obedience and consequences for disobedience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devarim is thought of as a repetition or a summation of the Torah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As traditionally Torah is written on scrolls, the written Torah of Moses is referred to as the Sefer Torah – or Torah Scroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individual books would similarly be called Sefer Bereshit, Sefer Shemot, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also see/hear the term “Chumash” – this is the Torah in book form as opposed to a scroll. Chumash is related to the number five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jews are meticulous about copying Torah scrolls and there are some 4000 guidelines a scribe must follow; if any one is broken, then the scroll is not kosher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.png&#34; style=&#34;width:50%;float:right&#34; alt=&#34;Text, letter Description automatically generated&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A formal Torah scroll will use a decorative script called “Stam.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth line in the graphic is an example of the Stam script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that eight of the letters have “crowns” called tagin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some speculate that these are the “tittles” that Jesus referred to in Matthew 5:18&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image shows the evolution of Hebrew writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first two lines are ancient forms of Hebrew, the third line is what is called “Rashi script” used in the middle ages, the fifth line is contemporary block script, and the last line is modern Hebrew cursive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-oral-torah&#34;&gt;What is the Oral Torah?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One significant area where Christians and Jews part company is the relevance of the Oral Torah. The Oral Torah is essentially a commentary on the written Torah that comes to us in the form of the Mishnah (200 CE) and Gemara (500 CE), which collectively form the Talmud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judaism holds that the works of the Talmud were transmitted to Moses along with the written Torah at Mt Sinai. This was then passed down through the elders until it was finally written down around the time of Jesus and shortly after. Jews hold a form of continuous succession very similar to how Catholics view the Pope as an unbroken line of succession from Peter. Just as the decrees of the Pope have the same apostolic authority as the 1st-century disciples for Catholics, Jews view the opinions of the Talmud as carrying the same weight as the words of Moses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is commonly thought among Christians that Jesus disputed with the Pharisees and their Oral Torah and traditions at every turn. He did not. Although we can certainly cite examples where Jesus overturned the traditions of men, He also agreed with the traditions of the Pharisees on many occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest commandments of Love the LORD with all your heart, soul, and strength and Love your neighbor as yourself, were cited as the greatest commandments from the Oral Torah before Jesus’ time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The golden rule of Matthew 7:12 was first ascribed to Rabbi Hillel who lived several decades before Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus blessed the bread and the Cups at the final Passover. There is no command to do so in Exodus but Jesus was following the traditional Passover Seder (order) of His day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus recognized the authority of the Sanhedrin, again not in the written Torah but contained the Oral Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The areas where Jesus broke from tradition almost always involved occasions where Jesus extended compassion and did so fully within the guidelines of the WRITTEN Torah such as when He and the disciples gathered grain on the Sabbath and when Jesus performed other Sabbath healings. He also rejected man-man fences that may have started as good intentions but ended up being at best empty religious gestures, or worse, impeded people from a true relationship with the Father. In my studies, I have come to view these not as attacks on Judaism, or even on the Pharisees but on man-made rules and acts of religious self-righteousness. In other words, Jesus attacks the very things that you and I are also guilty of imposing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example that comes to mind of a modern fence is the use of alcohol. The Bible never says “don’t drink,” it says “don’t be drunk.” So as a hedge against not becoming drunk, our churches impose rules that their membership or leadership can’t ever touch alcohol. While this may be a great idea, and certainly anyone who has a problem with alcohol shouldn’t drink, what about the person who doesn’t have a problem and likes to enjoy a glass of wine with a nice meal? We’ve now prohibited a person from doing something that is in fact biblical if done in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could cite a similarly mixed bag on Paul’s opinion of the Oral Torah. Paul frequently quotes from stories later recorded in the Talmud, and in some sense, it appears Paul even recognized he was establishing a new Torah based on his interpretations (Romans 3:31 – do we nullify the law through faith? On the contrary, we establish the Law). Like Jesus, Paul argued against empty spirituality, non-scriptural myths and traditions, and works of self-righteousness. To say that he attacked Judaism is not correct; he attacked non-Biblical practices within Judaism. If Paul were writing to us, he would attack non-biblical practices within Christianity of which there are countless examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the commentaries we use for our studies at Talmidim Way, particularly those from First Fruits of Zion (a messianic Jewish/Christian ministry), rely heavily on what we might call “Rabbinic literature,” which includes but is not limited to the Talmud. We consult these the same way we would a commentary by Charles Spurgeon, Matthew Henry, or J. Vernon McGee. In many cases, the rabbis wrote of Messiah in the Old Testament in ways that expand, illuminate, and affirm our faith in Yeshua. This is true not only of the Talmud, but also sages from the middle ages such as Rashi, and even insights from Chasidic teaching in the late 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are writings that are entirely ignored by most Christians simply because they are “Jewish.” Jesus and Paul didn’t cast aside the full body of these writings; we shouldn’t either. Since many of the sages and rabbis lived around the time of Jesus and the apostles, we can also gain insights into the Jewish context and culture of Jesus’ first-century world. This should not be a surprise since Yeshua, the apostles, and the New Testament writers were all Jewish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-do-we-need-to-study-the-old-testament&#34;&gt;Why do we need to study the Old Testament?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a saying that Christians and traditional Jews bought tickets to the same play, but the Jews left at intermission and the Christians arrived well after the second act had started. As a result, neither group has the complete story. Most Jews don’t recognize that Jesus is the Jewish MESSIAH and most Christians don’t recognize Him as the JEWISH Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus appeared to the disciples on the Road to Emmaus, He did NOT say, “Guys, it’s me!” Instead, “beginning with Moses and with all the prophets, He explained to them the things concerning Himself in all the Scriptures” (Luke 24:27). The disciples determined proof of Jesus and His resurrection from our Old Testament. As Lancaster says, “They had seen the living Messiah within the Torah.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus also said, “If you believed Moses, you would believe Me, for he wrote about Me” (John 5:46). The Torah and Jesus are both refered to as “The Word of God.” Jesus is the Word made flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, we know who wrote the Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite modern scholarship attributing it to later editors such as J, E, D, and P&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, according to Jesus, it was Moses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chuck Missler said, the Bible is 66 books, written by 40 different (human) authors, over thousands of years yet is ONE integrated message.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Heb 10:5,7 Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said… ‘Behold, I have come to do your will, O God, as it is written of me in the scroll of the book.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the example of doing His will, as Paul says in 2 Timothy 3:16-17, we study to learn, but we learn in order to be complete and equipped for good works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-with-all-the-hebrew&#34;&gt;What is with all the Hebrew?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrew is the language of the Torah. Jesus was born into and ministered to a Hebraic community. He likely spoke a combination of Hebrew and Aramaic, not Greek. As we said above, many Christians are only now discovering that Jesus is the JEWISH Messiah. Therefore when we use terms like Messiah instead of Christ, Yeshua instead of Jesus, it helps to remind us of this Hebraic context. Messiah from Meshiach, means “anointed one”. It is Yeshua’s title, not his name. Yeshua in Hebrew means “salvation.” Jesus is an anglicized version of the Greek and Latin Iesus. Yeshua haMashiach and Jesus Christ mean the same thing. His original talmidim (disciples) would have called him Yeshua, so I suggest as 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century talmidim, we can too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use a sprinkling of Hebrew here and there (as we have done above in this lesson) as a way of connecting ourselves to the rich tradition of Torah study passed down to us with the same care and decorum the Hebrew Scriptures themselves were passed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this note, pronouncing the Covenant Name of God (transliterated Y/H/W/H) is considered highly disrespectful in Jewish culture. A close parallel in our culture would be that, in most cases, it is inappropriate and disrespectful for children to address their parents and grandparents by their first names. The ESV and many other versions will use the circumlocution (using a different word to indirectly refer to something else) LORD whenever the original text has the Covenant Name. In verbal conversation, most Jews will say either Adonai (my Lord) or HaShem (the Name). “Yah” as a shortened form is acceptable if that’s how it appears in the text, such as “Hallelu Yah.” Otherwise, we encourage Christians to say God, Lord, or Adonai instead of the Covenant Name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, “Jehovah” is a completely made-up word and, in my humble opinion, should be removed from our vocabulary. It is an example of adding to the text something that was never there (see Revelation 22:18 and Deuteronomy 4:2). It was the accident of someone who thought they knew Hebrew but didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-introduction&#34;&gt;Genesis Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis is a book of beginnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew title for the book is &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;בְּרֵאשִׁית&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is pronounced as b&lt;sup&gt;ə&lt;/sup&gt;ray-SHEET&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ב&lt;/span&gt; is a one-letter prefix meaning “in”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ראש&lt;/span&gt; is the verbal root and means “chief” or “head”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a great book to study after Revelation because many things that have their climax or fulfillment in Revelation had their beginnings in Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are essentially only two world views today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The universe and life on earth is the result of a cosmic accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheism, materialism, evolutionism, humanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who claim to be atheists are generally adherents to one of the other three “isms” – they have a religion; they just don’t call it that.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The universe and life on earth are the results of deliberate design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if there’s design, there must be a Designer.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only Christianity and Judaism, but all other forms of religion (including pantheism (god is everywhere, and in all things), and polytheism (there are many gods)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis anticipates all false philosophies.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It directly refutes the “accident” worldview and all other “higher power” philosophies besides Judaism and Christianity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major implication from the Creation account is that everything that exists must be under God’s authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do we really live our lives like we are under God’s authority?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis is not a history nor a science textbook, but where it does assert specific historical or scientific events, we hold those assertions to be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not provided every detail; for example when the angels were created, or when Satan fell,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our series will not invest much time exploring these subjects unless they directly impact our ability to understand the biblical text or the nature of God/the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website “Answers in Genesis” is a great resource for anyone wishing to dive deeper into creation vs evolution, the big bang theory, the age of the earth, dinosaurs, and many other topics from the sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his Genesis commentary, Chuck Missler also provides a one-hour lecture on each day of creation from a scientific perspective (the nature of light, the thermal profile of water, hyperdimensional realities, and so forth).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholarly websites and archaeologists will explore the various other Ancient Near Eastern historical and legend literature as it relates to Genesis (Egyptian, Gilgamesh, Enuma Elish epics, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis outline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main sections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prehistory: 1-11 (Adam and Noah are the predominant figures)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham and the Patriarchs: 12-50 (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-11&#34;&gt;Genesis 1:1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;בְּרֵאשִׁית, בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים, אֵת הַשָּׁמַיִם, וְאֵת הָאָרֶץ&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me. But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words? - Jesus (John 5:46-47)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the Scriptures begin, not from the first person perspective of some man’s understanding of God, but from an omniscient third-person perspective, a Voice that reveals the Glorious Power that created the entire cosmos by means of His Word. – John J. Parsons&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Genesis 1:1 is immensely fulfilling and frustratingly incomplete, “shrouded as it is in mystery”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is eternal, timeless&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; and transcendent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is outside our physical world because He is the one who designed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is not bound by the physical properties of length, height, depth, and time because He created those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word we use for being outside time is eternal. God is eternal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s as if God said, “that’s all you need to know about Me for now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our other questions we have may be answered only through a deeper relationship with Him and through serious study of His Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pryor states, “the inherent purpose and meaning of this existence are mysteries for man to discover…the choice to attempt to discern these mysteries is ours.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:1 should invite us to want to dig deeper and learn more about our Designer, our Creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God created all things through the Messiah, and for the Messiah.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. [2] He was in the beginning with God. [3] All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. (John 1:1-3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world was created only for the sake of Messiah. (b.&lt;em&gt;Sanhedrin&lt;/em&gt; 98b)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world. (Heb 1:2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. (John 1:10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; was wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD possessed me (Wisdom) at the beginning of his work, the first of his acts of old. [23] Ages ago I was set up, at the first, before the beginning of the earth. (Pro 8:22-23)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.” (1Co 1:24)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;““And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write: ‘The words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of God&amp;rsquo;s creation.” (Rev 3:14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Latin term you may hear in relation to the Creation is &lt;em&gt;ex nihilo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made from nothing – God didn’t take spare parts and make the heavens and the earth. He created out of nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be helpful to think of Genesis 1:1 not as a specific point in time but as the beginning of an initial time period.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our western way of thinking (procedurally, chronologically), we naturally would see verse two as the next thing that happened after verse one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Jewish sages might see verse 1 as the general statement, then verses 1:2 – 2:3 as going back and filling in details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, the creation of Man in Genesis 2 is not a conflicting or different creation story, but an expansion of Chapter 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hypothetical conversation to illustrate this view might be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God: at the beginning of creation were the heavens and the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Person: How did You do this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God: Well, first the earth was without form, then I sent my Spirit through whom I created everything above, around and below you in six days, then I imposed a Sabbath rest on creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Person: Can You tell me more about how the man and the woman were created?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God: Absolutely! I form the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into him the spirit of life and man became alive (etc., etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most popular translations (KJV, ESV, NLT) translate this as “in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.” I.e., verse 1 is a complete sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the only technically accurate translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to read Bereshit as being in construct form; in other words, “the beginning of” something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to two possible translations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of Gods creation of the heavens and the earth, &lt;strong&gt;the earth was without form and void&lt;/strong&gt;.” (verses 1-2 are one sentence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the beginning of God’s creation…, when the earth was formless and void, &lt;strong&gt;God said ‘Let there be light&lt;/strong&gt;.” (verses 1-3 are one sentence.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I would endorse the traditional reading of verse one as a complete thought, the other options are interesting to ponder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is as expressed by Feinberg, “Before time began, God created space for heaven and earth.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hebrew-lesson--span-dirrtlבראשית-ברא-אלהים-את-השמים-ואת-הארץspan&#34;&gt;Hebrew Lesson -&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים אֵת הַשָּׁמַיִם וְאֵת הָאָרֶץ&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;בְּרֵאשִׁית&lt;/span&gt; – literally “in beginning”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ב&lt;/span&gt; – prepositional prefix usually meaning “in”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ראשׁ&lt;/span&gt; - head or chief&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;בָּרָא&lt;/span&gt;- he created (verb)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אֱלֹהִים&lt;/span&gt;- God, gods (subject, doer of the verb’s action; the subject usually follows verb in Hebrew)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אֵת&lt;/span&gt; – untranslated – comes before a definite direct object (DDO)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;הַשָּׁמַיִם&lt;/span&gt;- the heaven/heavens (object, receiver of the verb’s action)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prefix &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ה&lt;/span&gt; means “the”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrew has a handful of words that are in a plural or dual form but are usually translated singular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;וְאֵת&lt;/span&gt; – DDO marker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prefix &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ו&lt;/span&gt; most often means “and”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;הָאָרֶץ&lt;/span&gt;- the earth (object)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fun-with-the-text&#34;&gt;Fun with the text&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages have analyzed verse 1 over the centuries and have come up with some insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t use this to build doctrine, which of course must only come from a plain-sense reading of the text, but we’re just having fun and enjoying different aspects of God’s holy Word. &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The general rule is such wordplay must only confirm doctrine established elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We won’t do this with every verse but there is a wealth of thought regarding Genesis 1:1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler has noted a curious occurrence with Genesis 1:1 and John 1:1.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Hebrew and Greek have assigned numerical values for each letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Hebrew, &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;א&lt;/span&gt; = 1, &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ב&lt;/span&gt;=2, etc. It goes 1-9, then by 10s to 100, then by hundreds to 900.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Genesis 1:1 (Hebrew) if you take the number of letters X the product of the letters / the number of words times the product of the words you get 3.1416 X10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John 1:1 (Greek) if you do the same you get 2.7183 x 10&lt;sup&gt;65&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:1 is the value of &lt;em&gt;π&lt;/em&gt; to four decimal places, and John 1:1 is the value of &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; rounded to four places. Most are familiar with pi but less familiar with &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; which is the mathematical expression for the natural logarithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, two irrational mathematical constants are apparently tucked away in Genesis 1:1 and John 1:1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chuck himself would say, “I don’t know what you do with this information, but it sure is curious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does seem too coincidental to be accidental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keren Pryor notes that there are seven words in Genesis 1:1 that correspond with the seven days of creation.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:21&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend, Izzy Avraham, highlights several examples in his reading of Genesis 1. &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:22&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does the Torah begin with &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;בּ&lt;/span&gt; and not &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;א&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;א&lt;/span&gt; represents God (God the Father to Christians) and is the first letter of &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אֱלֹהִים&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Torah does not begin with an &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;א&lt;/span&gt; because God was already there in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;בְּרֵאשִׁית&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages have come up with different combinations of these six letters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;בי ראשׁת&lt;/span&gt; – in Me, is the beginning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is preexistent and spoke the beginning of creation into existence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;בית ראש&lt;/span&gt; – house of the head –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when the Creator created the universe, He created the earth and the heavens as a dwelling place for us to inhabit and commune with Him&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who then is the “head”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headmaster in a Jewish school is called the “rosh”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ,” (Eph 4:15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us come into His house and study under our Rosh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;בית ארש&lt;/span&gt; – house of the betrothed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is courting us; we are the bride of Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us be pure and undefiled!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;בית אשר&lt;/span&gt; – house of the blessed/happy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The creation was intended for us to find pleasure, not in our own pursuits but in communing with Him&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above three &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;בית&lt;/span&gt; examples also speak of the Messianic redemption, which we studied in Revelation. In that day we will be under His direct authority, in His house, as His bride and we will be blessed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא&lt;/span&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָ א&lt;/span&gt; – In the beginning was the Son of &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;א&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We mentioned above that &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;א&lt;/span&gt; can represent the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;בר&lt;/span&gt; in Hebrew and Aramaic can mean Son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אֵת&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and last letters of the Hebrew aleph-bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DDO marker that is not translated in the Bible but often hints at Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am the Alpha/Aleph and the Omega/Tav, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.” (Rev 22:13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If God (subject) wants to do something (verb) with us (object), He works through Jesus, the &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;א&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ת&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as the direct object receives the action of the sentence through &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אֵת&lt;/span&gt;, so do we the creation receive the action of the creator through Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zechariah 12:10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;וְהִבִּ֥יטוּ אֵלַ֖י &lt;strong&gt;אֵ֣ת&lt;/strong&gt; אֲשֶׁר־דָּקָ֑רוּ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They shall look upon him, (the &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;א&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ת&lt;/span&gt;), whom they have pierced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:1 has seven words: -&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים &lt;strong&gt;אֵת&lt;/strong&gt; הַשָּׁמַיִם &lt;strong&gt;וְאֵת&lt;/strong&gt; הָאָרֶץ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אֵת&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could these represent the first and second comings of Yeshua?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s look at the word positions: the first &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אֵת&lt;/span&gt; is the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; word and the second &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אֵת&lt;/span&gt; is the sixth word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His first coming was at the end of the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; millennium when he taught “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” After He was crucified and resurrected, he ascended into Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;הַשָּׁמַיִם&lt;/span&gt; , the heavens, or heaven, is the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From other passages (including the fact that there are six &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;א&lt;/span&gt;’s in Genesis 1:1 to represent &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;א&lt;/strong&gt;דם&lt;/span&gt;, Adam, man), the sages concluded that Messiah would come after the sixth millennium to usher in the Messianic kingdom on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 19 describes that earthly kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seventh word in Genesis 1:1 is &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;הָאָרֶץ&lt;/span&gt;, the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-session&#34;&gt;Next session&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will look at Genesis 1 and the seven days of creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew calendar, which is primarily lunar based, has a form of leap year to keep in relative sync with the solar year. The Jewish leap year is nothing like the routine Gregorian leap year that adds one day every four years. Hebrew adds a month seven times every 19 years, often with extra modifications of adding or subtracting one day to prevent holidays from landing on specific days of the week.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this reading schedule will not align with our study of Genesis, which is going at a much slower pace around one chapter per week. We encourage readers to read through the entire Torah as we study Genesis together.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Torcaso v. Watkins&lt;/em&gt;, a footnote in the majority opinion included “secular humanism” in a list of religions. As it is apparently the only “religion” not just allowed but mandated in our public schools, many including Missler have quipped that Secular Humanism is the “Official religion of the United States.”&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God creates the world in six days. On the first day He makes darkness and light. On the second day He forms the heavens, dividing the “upper waters” from the “lower waters.” On the third day He sets the boundaries of land and sea, and calls forth trees and greenery from the earth. On the fourth day He fixes the position of the sun, moon and stars as timekeepers and illuminators of the earth. Fish, birds and reptiles are created on the fifth day; land animals, and then the human being, on the sixth. G‑d ceases work on the seventh day, and sanctifies it as a day of rest.—Chabad.org&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;John 1:1-4, 10&lt;/sup&gt; In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made…. He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 45:18&lt;/sup&gt; For thus says the LORD, who created the heavens (he is God!), who formed the earth and made it (he established it; &lt;strong&gt;he did not create it empty&lt;/strong&gt;, he formed it to be inhabited!): “I am the LORD, and there is no other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Job 26:7&lt;/sup&gt; He stretches out the north over the void and hangs the earth on nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Jeremiah 4:23&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;I looked on the earth, and behold, it was without form and void; and to the heavens, and they had no light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Veha’ARetz haytah TOhu vaVOhu, vCHOshech al p’nei t’home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton notes the passage expresses the sense of “that which has not yet been differentiated and assigned function. No boundaries or definitions have been established.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Gap Theory”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;תֹּהוּ&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;em&gt;tohu)&lt;/em&gt; is the word used in verse 2 for “waste, desolation, empty”. The same word is used in Isaiah 45:18, who says that God did NOT create the earth &lt;em&gt;tohu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There appears to be a contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this the so-called “gap theory” has emerged – they see some type of gap between verses 1 and 2, where some type of judgment occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try to support this, a minority of scholars would say the verse could be translated, “BUT the earth HAD BECOME formless and void.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, God created the earth to be perfect, but there was some kind of judgment causing it to become formless, void, and dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This judgment then led to the recreation of the surface of the earth in six days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keil &amp;amp; Delitzsch reject this concept. “Tohu alone is frequently employed as synonymous with non-existence (not becoming non-existent).”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember there is no life or death on earth until the Fall in chapter 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, people who try to put dinosaurs into this “gap” to conform with modern hypotheses about what killed the dinosaurs or reconcile with evolutionary theory are misguided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potentially it is when Satan fell, but even this theory has problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occam’s Razor tells us that the most straightforward explanation is usually the correct one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most straightforward explanation to reconcile Genesis 1:2 and Isaiah 45:18, is when God initially created the earth, He didn’t create it to be permanently formless and void (Isaiah).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was momentarily formless, void, and dark (possibly only for a fraction of an instant) until the Ruach Elohim went into action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage readers to hold very loosely to any man-made theory about what is going on in Genesis 1-6. We just don’t have a very good concept of what life was like before the Flood and even less insight about what life was like before the Fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Answers in Genesis site has an informative article on this topic: &lt;a href=&#34;https://answersingenesis.org/genesis/gap-theory/the-gap-theory-an-idea-with-holes/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Gap Theory – an Idea with Holes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that God specifically created the darkness - Isa 45:7 I form light and create darkness; I make well-being and create calamity; I am the LORD, who does all these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “deep” is a term surrounded in mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symbolically, the “deep” and “waters” suggest chaos (and were viewed as such by the ancients)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Luk 4:17, 21&lt;/sup&gt; He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me…” And he began to say to them, “Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen Rabbah 1:2&lt;/sup&gt; “The Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters.” This was the Spirit of Messiah as it is written, “The Spirit of the Lord will rest on him.”&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Lancaster, 3rd ed., vol. 4, Torah Club 3 (Marshfield, MO: First Fruits of Zion, 2015), 6.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;V’RUach Elohim m’raCHEphet al p’nei haMYim.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many see the plural &lt;em&gt;Elohim&lt;/em&gt; together with &lt;em&gt;Ruach&lt;/em&gt; (breath, wind, spirit) as a hint of the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a plain reading of the text doesn’t suggest the Christian Trinity, it’s not an unfair “deeper meaning” extrapolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Midrash, part of the Oral Torah we referenced previously, the Spirit of Elohim that hovered in Genesis 1:2 was the Spirit of Messiah; as their proof text, the rabbis quoted Isaiah 11, just as Jesus did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous lesson we established that Yeshua, the Aleph and the Tav, not only was present at the Creation, the Creation was achieved THROUGH Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We clearly have the Father, the Son, and the Spirit present at Creation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the complete passage in the Midrash references the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Form = Israel’s exile to Babylon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Void = Israel’s subjugation under Persia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darkness = Israel’s harsh treatment under the Greeks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep = Israel’s conquest by the Romans&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waters = Israel’s repentance in exile&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spirit of God = Messiah’s redemption of Israel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view parallels what we read in Daniel chapters 2 and 7, and throughout Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waters = chaos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heiser notes, “in the ancient world, the sea was a thing of dread. Unpredictable and untamable. The waters of the primeval deep must be calmed and restrained by God.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster writes, “When Messiah comes, He will transform the formless, the void, the darkness, the deep, and all the sorrows of this present age of exile into the light and joy of a new world and new creation.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus walked on the Sea of Galilee, it was not the first time God hovered above the chaos!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;td&gt;And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rev 21:23&lt;/sup&gt; And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Joh 8:12&lt;/sup&gt; Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1Jn 1:7&lt;/sup&gt; But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;וַיֹּ֥אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֖ים יְהִ֣י אֹ֑ור וַֽיְהִי־אֹֽור&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;VaYOmer Elohim “y’hi or,” vayahi or.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vayomer is the most frequently occurring verb in Hebrew – it means “and (he) said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vayomer Elohim means “and God said”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first recorded statement of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This light is not the sun, which won’t be created for a few more days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Light from God Himself, the Light of the Messianic Age – the same light we saw in Revelation chapters 21 and 22, where we have no more need for the sun, moon, and the stars for light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, note that the Light evidently will illuminate the entire earth at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**“**Rabbi Elazar said: The light that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created on the first day was not that of the sun but a different kind of light, through which man could observe from one end of the world to the other.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire Gospel of John has the themes of light versus darkness running through it;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John contrasts the Good Shepherd Jesus, versus the rejecting world, including the bad shepherds currently in control of the religious establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identical themes run through many of the Dead Sea Scrolls documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2 Co 4:6&lt;/sup&gt; For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 60:1-2&lt;/sup&gt; Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the LORD has risen upon you. [2] For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the peoples; but the LORD will arise upon you, and his glory will be seen upon you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Joh 9:39&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus said, “For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Yalkut Shim’oni 11.499&lt;/sup&gt; This is the light of Messiah, as it is said, “God saw the light, that it was good.” Before the world was created, the Holy One, blessed by He, looked forward to the generation of Messiah. He hid the Light for Messiah beneath his throne of Glory.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vay’hi-erev, vay’hi voqer, Yom Echad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of seven “it was good” statements is given to the Divine Light&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the same light that will illuminate the Messianic Age (Revelation 21:23).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish days begin and end at sundown – literally and symbolically, each day moves from darkness to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our point of view is the opposite – light is swallowed up by the darkness (both daily, and at times metaphorically, when we see good being overtaken by evil).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From God’s perspective, it is just the opposite. Day follows night, darkness is dispelled by light, evil is conquered by good, and death gives way to light.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation chapters 19-22 give us the end of the story when the Light reigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Revelation chapters 13-18, as well as Isaiah 60:2, we also see that while the coming of Messiah brings light to believers, it brings darkness to the wicked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we said in the introduction, the Person whom we might call the “Divine Narrator” (i.e., some manifestation of God dictating to Moses), is not “trying to give us a modern scientific explanation of the origin of all natural phenomena,” such as light. With that noted, Chuck Missler, who has an engineering background sees God instituting order and the physical laws of the planet throughout the creation days (increasing in magnitude and specificity on each of the successive days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erev, according to Missler, suggests increasing chaos and increasing entropy. Erev gives way to Boker, which suggests increasing order and decreasing entropy.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day, as God originally designed it, there is no more Erev or Boker. The creation is complete and perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surface, what we might call “plain text,” reading is about physical light and physical darkness, but throughout the Bible, most notably in John’s writings, we see spiritual light versus spiritual darkness. Those who can see spiritually versus those who are spiritually blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, this is a cardinal, not an ordinal number. Not “the first day” (which would have been &lt;em&gt;yom rishon&lt;/em&gt;, but “day one”, &lt;em&gt;yom echad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:1-5 in Hebrew is relatively easy to memorize. I encourage it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God made the expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse. And it was so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Psa 74:13,15&lt;/sup&gt; You divided the sea by your might; you broke the heads of the sea monsters on the waters. [15] You split open springs and brooks; you dried up ever-flowing streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2 Pe 3:4-5&lt;/sup&gt; They will say, “Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation.” For they deliberately overlook this fact, that the heavens existed long ago, and the earth was formed out of water and through water by the word of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2Ch 2:6&lt;/sup&gt; But who is able to build him a house, since heaven, even highest heaven, cannot contain him? Who am I to build a house for him, except as a place to make offerings before him?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no “it was good” for Monday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This passage invites a discussion on what we know about our atmosphere and space – as we mentioned in an earlier lesson, we would refer anyone interested to answersingenesis.org or Chuck Missler’s materials for a deeper discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, the word for sky and heaven is the same: shamayim. This is difficult because the sky we can see, space we can see (through a telescope) but that doesn’t mean we are looking into heaven where God dwells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solomon, in a moment of humility, acknowledged this in 2 Chronicles 2:6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes God going out of His way to dwell with us all the more incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Jer 5:22&lt;/sup&gt; Do you not fear me? declares the LORD. Do you not tremble before me? I placed the sand as the boundary for the sea, a perpetual barrier that it cannot pass; though the waves toss, they cannot prevail; though they roar, they cannot pass over it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the “it was good” statements contrast with how many ancients viewed the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To them the world was often unstable and threatening, such as when there were storms, floods, fire, droughts or earthquakes. The gods they had associated with these natural elements were seen as having the ability to be angered unless they were appeased in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton says, “That it was all ‘good’ reflects God’s wisdom and justice.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth.” And it was so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1Co 15:38-39&lt;/sup&gt; But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body. [39] For not all flesh is the same, but there is one kind for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Heb 6:7&lt;/sup&gt; For land that has drunk the rain that often falls on it, and produces a crop useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third day receives two “it was good” commendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps, this is a hint of the many blessings and other significant events that will occur on the “third day” throughout the Bible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler sees Job 38 as a parallel passage for the Third Day of Creation.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. And let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and let them be lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth.” And it was so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Deu 4:19&lt;/sup&gt; And beware lest you raise your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven, you be drawn away and bow down to them and serve them, things that the LORD your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rom 1:25&lt;/sup&gt; They exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancient cultures looked up at the sky in wonderment. They concluded that there must be a sun-god who controls the sun, a moon-god who controls the moon, and later a rain-god who controls the rain and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible refutes this directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible clearly teaches monotheism, which was in stark contrast to all of the other ancient cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nature, despite all its beauty and splendor, is not to be worshipped or considered as God.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one Creator. Everything else is the creation, and therefore beneath than the Creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteronomy 4 reminds us that only God is to be worshipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may find it silly to bow down to worship a wooden idol of a sun god, yet we may pursue a job at the expense of all other things, or we save up for that car we have to have, or we tell ourselves that if only we had {x}, then we would be happy. This is worshipping the creation just as much as bowing down to a sun-god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul in Romans 1 uses an interesting example of worshipping the creation. While it’s easy to point fingers at the sexual perversion around us (and I’m not saying we shouldn’t defend Biblical teaching on the subject in the right context), but let’s remember the things we do that are the equivalent of worshipping the creation rather than the Creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word for signs, is interestingly the same word for letter and has a cognate word in Akkadian that means “omen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, the other ancient societies feared the natural world and attributed such “unpredictability” to the gods behind the natural forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is going out of His way to remove any personification of nature for His people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each day has a cycle of setting and a rising sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each month has a cycle of the new moon to a full moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew month begins on the new moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like the Hebrew day, the month begins in darkness and moves to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year has a cycle of the seasons, marked by the (apparent) movement in the sky of the sun, and in some cases the paths of planets visible to the naked eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;And God made the two great lights—the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night—and the stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Psa 19:1-5&lt;/sup&gt; The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork. Day to day pours out speech, and night to night reveals knowledge. There is no speech, nor are there words, whose voice is not heard. Their voice goes out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tent for the sun, which comes out like a bridegroom leaving his chamber, and, like a strong man, runs its course with joy.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps to avoid having His people get confused with the sun-gods and the moon-gods of Israel’s neighbors, God avoid using names for the sun and the mood. They are only the greater light and the lesser light.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1Co 15:39&lt;/sup&gt; For not all flesh is the same, but there is one kind for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creation is increasing in complexity. Day five sees creatures with the following systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-modifying; self-programming, self-diagnostic, self-repairing, self-reproducing&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these systems are contained within the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such systems can’t “evolve; if any one of the systems fails, the animal dies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets worse: the systems are interdependent. All systems functioning from day 1 are required for survival. If one isn’t working, there is no chance of being fruitful and multiplying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most advanced of these is yet to come: the human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds—livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As opposed to simply saying “land creatures (as He essentially does with sea creatures and air creatures), he divides land-based creatures into three categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domestic animals, with whom man to this day shares a unique bond&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creeping things – a broad category that might include reptiles, amphibians, insects and perhaps microscopic organisms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beasts of the earth, i.e., wild, non-domesticated animals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Col 3:8-10&lt;/sup&gt; But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth. Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed &lt;strong&gt;in knowledge after the image of its creator&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mat 19:4 (Mar 10:6)&lt;/sup&gt; He answered, “Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Eph 4:24&lt;/sup&gt; and to put on the new self, &lt;strong&gt;created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Jas 3:9&lt;/sup&gt; With (our tongues) we bless our Lord and Father, and &lt;strong&gt;with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love your neighbor application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Pliskin says, “Love of one’s neighbor which is not motivated by the realization that man was created in God’s image is doomed to fail. When we realize that man alone is fashioned (in God’s image), he is suddenly transformed from an inconsequential being into one that is without parallel. He is the pinnacle of Creation.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mic 6:8 He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slightest act of lovingkindness pleases God because we are honoring another made in His image. This includes a smile to a stranger you will probably never see again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be a challenge to love our neighbor when he or she does not reflect the character of God. The same can be said of you and me when we don’t reflect the image of our Creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages debated which verse was more significant: Leviticus 19:18 or Genesis 1:27.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One sage who likely was unfamiliar with Luke’s gospel argued in favor of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His rationale was that the term “neighbor” could have a tendency to be narrowly defined as those who are like me. History bore this out in the parable of the Good Samaritan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that ALL mankind is created in His image means we don’t need to ask the question “who is my neighbor?” The answer is obvious. It includes people who are not like us as well as those who are. We also don’t GET to ask that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we view Genesis 2 as providing more detail on the creation of man (which is the viewpoint we recommend, as opposed to a chronological event following Genesis 1, or God-forbid, a conflicting creation account as some skeptics view it), then we see God was much more intimately involved with the creation of man than with any other body or being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster quoting Rashi: “Everything else was created through an utterance of God, but man was created with God’s hands.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volumes have been written about what exactly it means to be made in God’s image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton defines as “(God’s) representative containing His essence.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He also adds, “(in other ancient cultures) it is only other gods who are made in the image of gods.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster suggests, being made in God’s image means, man alone has moral obligation to choose right but free agency to make that choice or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in some respects, I agree with this and it is certainly what differentiates humans from other created beings, Heiser disagrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Defining image bearing as ANY ability is a flawed approach.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, he states a human is born without any such ability and some never gain these abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The image is not an ability, but a status. To be human is to image God.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An apt parallel is to think of ourselves as ambassadors or agents of Yeshua with God as the principal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agent is granted authority (or “status”) by the principal to act on the principal’s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agent must put the principal’s interest above his own when going about the principal’s business (and we’re to be about God’s business 24/7/365).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a third party observes the agent, they draw conclusions about the nature, preferences, and character of the principal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agent’s behavior reflects the character of the principal (positively or negatively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a third party mistreats the agent, it is the same as if they mistreated the principal (read Revelation!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does the verse say “God said, ‘let Us…’?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Christians see the Trinity in view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creation of man is attributed to the Father in Genesis, to the Son in Colossians 1:16, and to the Spirit in Job 33:4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heiser cautions against reading the Christian trinity into Genesis 1:26-27: “Hebrew grammar and exegesis has shown that the Trinity is not a coherent explanation.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this may not be supported by the plain text, it’s not an unfair “deeper meaning” application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are exactly three instances of “image” in this passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 5:17 But Jesus answered them, “My Father is working until now, and I am working.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 14:23 Jesus answered him, “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others would say it’s the “plural of majesty,” such as when a king or queen says “we are not amused.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages, in a theory echoed by Michael Heiser, see a “divine council” of angelic beings with God in charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we have is a single person (God) addressing a group – the members of His divine council.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not imply creation was a group consensus or project. Genesis 1:27 tells us plainly that God did the creating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see this in various places, but perhaps this type of council is most obvious in 1 Kings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Ki 22:19-22 And Micaiah said, “Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, &lt;strong&gt;and all the host of heaven standing beside him on his right hand and on his left&lt;/strong&gt;; [20] and the LORD said, ‘Who will entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’ And &lt;strong&gt;one said one thing, and another said another. [21] Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD, saying, ‘I will entice him.’&lt;/strong&gt; [22] And the LORD said to him, ‘By what means?’ And he said, ‘I will go out, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And he said, ‘You are to entice him, and you shall succeed; go out and do so.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, God consulted with His counsel (though He certainly didn’t need to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there was some discussion, then God finally issued the decree on behalf of the council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Jewish tradition, there was a dispute among the angels AFTER God’s made this decision.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:21&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were simultaneously upset that God overruled their protests and became jealous when they saw Adam in his (unfallen) splendor and glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These angels descended into the created world and conspired with the serpent to plot against Adam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ezekiel 28, the oracle against the King of Tyre transforms into a lament over Satan. God says, “You were in Eden, the garden of God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the rest, as they say, is history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-128-30--gods-commission-to-man&#34;&gt;Gen 1:28-30 – God’s commission to man&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And God blessed them. And God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Eph 1:4&lt;/sup&gt; even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Col 3:10&lt;/sup&gt; and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that “all souls that existed from the time of Adam the first man until the end of time, were all created during the six days of creation. All of them were in the Garden of Eden.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:22&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ephesians teaches that some part of us, the part we typically call our spirit or soul, existed before our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will also live on after our body perishes until at some point in the future, our bodies and souls/spirits will be reunited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster comments that the people of the world limit the size of their families based on finances. This is to have a spirit of fear. The child of God has no need to fear, and we should trust in God’s commandment to be fruitful and multiply.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:23&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:23&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Adam and Eve lost Eden, they also lost much of their authority over creation. We await the new Eden (Revelation 22) when all will be restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James 3 contrasts the dominion we have been given with our inability to control our tongues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sup&gt;James 3:7-8&lt;/sup&gt; For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind, but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit. You shall have them for food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1 Ti 4:4-5&lt;/sup&gt; For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other ancients viewed the world as created for the gods and their enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The various elements of creation came about as a result of conflict among the gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man was only an afterthought when the gods realized they needed servants to do their bidding or worshippers to appease them.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:24&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:24&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible presents the creation as a controlled and intricately designed (as opposed to arbitrarily determined by the results of a supernatural conflict) process to be under the dominion of man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the beginning, God planned man as the centerpiece of His creation.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:25&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:25&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not yet death so there would be no killing of animals for food. Yet, for some reason, man has to eat, which does requires cutting off a plant from its lifesource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One argument is that God “permitted” man to eat (except of the two trees) for his pleasure and fellowship. They were not commanded to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another argument is that their (at that moment) eternally healthy state might have been preconditioned on keeping the body fueled with a plant-based diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-131-very-good&#34;&gt;Gen 1:31 VERY good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genesis 1:31&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Act 17:24-25&lt;/sup&gt; The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man, nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just good but “very good” – not just &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;טֹ֖וב&lt;/span&gt;, but &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;טֹ֖וב &lt;strong&gt;מְאֹ֑ד&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;מְאֹ֑ד&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deu 6:5 You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your &lt;strong&gt;might&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;וּבְכָל־מְאֹדֶךָ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word for might is &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;מְאֹ֑ד&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love Him with all your “veryness” – with every fiber of your being, (perhaps “Love Him with the entirety of God’s creation in you”) is the thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;מְאֹ֑ד&lt;/span&gt; has the same Hebrew letters as &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אָדָ֜ם&lt;/span&gt;, Adam, so the creation of Man/Adam was very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam is thought of as an acronym:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messiah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical creation is very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often deemphasize the physical aspect of our nature and stress the spiritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thinking has roots in Greco-roman philosophy as well as early Christian Gnostic heresy, which taught that the physical world was evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be cautious about the thinking “heaven is my real home” or “I’m just passing through on the way to heaven.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s creation is not to be rejected as evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A man will have to give an account on the judgment day for every good and permissible thing which he might have enjoyed and did not.” (y.Kiddushin 4:12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we studied in Revelation; the New Heaven, New Earth, and New Jerusalem are all physical places. The afterlife will be a corporeal physical existence.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:26&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:26&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;This is the revelation which God gave to Yeshua the Messiah, so that he could show his servants what must happen very soon. He communicated it by sending his angel to his servant Yochanan,  2.  who bore witness to the Word of God and to the testimony of Yeshua the Messiah, as much as he saw.  3.  Blessed are the reader and hearers of the words of this prophecy, provided they obey the things written in it! For the time is near!  4.  From: Yochanan To: The seven Messianic communities in the province of Asia: Grace and shalom to you from the One who is, who was and who is coming; from the sevenfold Spirit before his throne;  5.  and from Yeshua the Messiah, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead and the ruler of the earth&amp;rsquo;s kings. To him, the one who loves us, who has freed us from our sins at the cost of his blood,  6.  who has caused us to be a kingdom, that is, cohanim for God, his Father—to him be the glory and the rulership forever and ever. Amen.  7.  Look! He is coming with the clouds! Every eye will see him, including those who pierced him; and all the tribes of the Land will mourn him. Yes! Amen!  8.  &amp;ldquo;I am the &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;Z,&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; says Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, the One who is, who was and who is coming.  9.  I, Yochanan, am a brother of yours and a fellow-sharer in the suffering, kingship and perseverance that come from being united with Yeshua. I had been exiled to the island called Patmos for having proclaimed the message of God and borne witness to Yeshua.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to our series on the book of Revelation we call &amp;ldquo;Revelation Backgrounds.&amp;rdquo;  In this introductory episode, we will provide an introduction to the book, some background into Jewish Apocalyptic literature, and we&amp;rsquo;ll provide what we see are Seven Keys to Interpretation.  Revelation can be a complex book, but these keys will help assure we get started on the right path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;revelation-not-revelations&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Revelation&amp;rdquo; (not &amp;ldquo;Revelations&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In his course on Jerusalem, Dr. Cargill said, &amp;ldquo;the name of the book is &amp;lsquo;RevelationnnnnnNUH,&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; he said to emphasize the singular&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He continued, &amp;ldquo;This is a pet peeve of mine. If you call it &amp;lsquo;RevelationS,&amp;rsquo; it means you have never read the 1st verse, and I will flunk you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, we won&amp;rsquo;t flunk anybody, but this is a good reminder that the correct name of the book is not &amp;ldquo;Revelation&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;rdquo; but &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Revelation.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-apocalyptic-literature&#34;&gt;What is &amp;ldquo;Apocalyptic Literature&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We often think of an apocalypse as some cataclysmic event involving worldwide destruction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the Greek word &lt;em&gt;apokalupsis&lt;/em&gt;, apocalypse means &amp;ldquo;revealing&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;unveiling.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specifically, we would say an unveiling of something not previously known, which wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be known were it not for divine intervention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the days of John, there was a significant body of Jewish apocalyptic literature that he and much of his audience would have known&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The general flow of apocalyptic literature:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A person in a &amp;ldquo;spiritual state,&amp;rdquo; such as fasting and praying, is caught up to a realm usually unseen by mortals (possibly physically or possibly by way of a vision).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is given a tour, usually guided by an angel, where he sees heavenly worship services, God&amp;rsquo;s throne, and various hallowed chambers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He also sometimes sees &amp;ldquo;the war behind the war.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, when there is a physical war on earth, the person gets to witness a corresponding unseen spiritual warfare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then he gets to witness a final climactic battle between the forces of good and evil and resulting judgments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often, the things the person with the vision sees are nearly impossible to put into words
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best he can do is use the best words he can,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because the human is trying to explain the inexplicable, we end up with the extreme symbolism, such as beasts doing strange things (Daniel 7:5-6) and objects that seem to defy the laws of physics (Ezekiel 1:16-20)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The general purpose of an Apocalypse is for God to reassure His people to remain faithful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster summarizes a biblical apocalypse like this:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Although things on earth seem terribly unjust, with the righteous suffering and the wicked prospering, a day is coming where God will pour out his wrath upon the wicked and reward the righteous.&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, &amp;ldquo;your faith and suffering are not in vain.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;The Apocalypse of Paul?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know Paul (or a man he knew) had an Apocalypse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Corinthians 12:2-4: &amp;ldquo;I know a man in Messiah (whether in the body I don&amp;rsquo;t know, or whether out of the body I don&amp;rsquo;t know—God knows)—fourteen years ago, he was caught up to the third heaven. I know such a man (whether in the body or outside of the body I don&amp;rsquo;t know—God knows)— he was caught up into Paradise and heard words too sacred to tell, which a human is not permitted to utter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a classic apocalyptic vision. Were it not for the &amp;ldquo;gag order,&amp;rdquo; we might have had not one but two Books titled &amp;ldquo;Revelation&amp;rdquo;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;seven-keys-to-interpretation&#34;&gt;Seven Keys to Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Revelation is perhaps the most studied but least understood book in the New Testament.&amp;rdquo; – Daniel Lancaster&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our primary challenge with understanding Revelation, or just about any other book of the Bible, is that we are separated from the original intended audience in three critical areas: time, distance, and most importantly, culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/49f033022fe7e954bd6946926032fbc0.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time – John recorded these events nearly 2000 years ago, and he often references writings written hundreds of years before that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distance – Turkey, the geographic setting for Revelation 2-3, is over 6000 nautical miles away from the central United States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Culture
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setting is a Jewish author writing to Jews and gentile God-fearers in the diaspora (Jews living outside the Land of Israel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These early believers knew their Scriptures, what we would call the &amp;ldquo;Old Testament,&amp;rdquo; much better than we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These believers brought a very different set of experiences, assumptions, and expectations than we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These areas may be less familiar to us if our context is western Protestant Christianity and we have never traveled to these lands. To bridge these gaps, our study in Revelation Backgrounds synthesizes several published commentaries that focus on the historical, geographic, and cultural (specifically Jewish) aspects of the Bible. We also consult Bible atlases, travel videos, and occasionally extra-biblical documents and pertinent archeologic findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In keeping with the pattern of &amp;ldquo;sevens&amp;rdquo; in Revelation, we have seven &amp;ldquo;Keys to Interpretation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-follow-the-talmidim-way&#34;&gt;#1 Follow the &amp;ldquo;Talmidim Way&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Talmidim&lt;/em&gt; is the Hebrew word for &amp;ldquo;disciples.&amp;rdquo; I am a &lt;em&gt;talmid&lt;/em&gt;. You are a &lt;em&gt;talmid&lt;/em&gt;. We are all &lt;em&gt;Talmidim&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talmidim was one of the first Hebrew words I ever learned, so it has a special place in my heart. The word is symbolic of a journey I&amp;rsquo;ve been on for over ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an expression that ancient Jewish disciples would follow their rabbi so closely that they would be &amp;ldquo;covered in his dust.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/547b202d55681e683cc9dab7b8528db4.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;33%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, I call the ministry the &lt;em&gt;Talmidim Way&lt;/em&gt;. Our logo contains a drawing of an ancient stone footpath to remind us that our faith is founded on old ways, and we should walk in the dust of our Rabbi Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Keener is one of my go-to commentators for historical context. He says much more eloquently, &amp;ldquo;Shedding light on the original provides modern readers better access to the message of the book when they seek to apply it today.&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-be-open-to-the-spirits-leading&#34;&gt;#2 Be open to the Spirit&amp;rsquo;s leading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us not cling too tightly to any presupposed interpretation or application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My positions on Revelation have changed over the years (see &amp;ldquo;we reserve the right to get smarter&amp;rdquo; callout)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to dive into the text, leverage the wisdom of trustworthy commentators who have gone before us, check everything out against Scripture&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and let the Spirit pour into us.
&lt;img src=&#34;images/dove.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may mean we need to leave behind a previously held position&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider yourself lucky if you do not already have a firm position on &amp;ldquo;pretribulation,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;preterist,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;postmillennial.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More division than edification occurs over these subjects, in my opinion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s ok to hold firm views, but remember we are all brothers and sisters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can and should debate and challenge; Proverbs 27:17 says, &amp;ldquo;As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let us never divide over these types of matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;We reserve the right to get smarter.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I admittedly am looking at myself when I say not to cling too tightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other times I&amp;rsquo;ve studied Revelation from end to end, I&amp;rsquo;ve been rather staunchly in the &amp;ldquo;futurist, pre-tribulation&amp;rdquo; camp. That means that my view of Revelation tended to be that after chapter 4, everything that happened was yet future (futurist). Before this happened, all the faithful believers would be raptured before the tribulation (pretribulation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, particularly after digging into the Gospels context and other things, I&amp;rsquo;m no longer 100% sold on that approach. Also, if we look at Jesus&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;one will be taken and the other left&amp;rdquo; statements and in the parables where all the fish are hauled in, but then some are removed, it&amp;rsquo;s not the good who are removed. It&amp;rsquo;s the wicked who are removed. It&amp;rsquo;s the rotten fish that are thrown back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not saying definitively that the pretribulation view is wrong. Only that now, my opinions are more flexible after further review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to have a colleague who liked to say, &amp;ldquo;we always reserve the right to get smarter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-be-a-berean-acts-1711&#34;&gt;#3 be a Berean (Acts 17:11)!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will begin every study with Acts 17:11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These (Bereans) were more noble than those in Thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so. (Acts 17:11 KJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 17:11 is paramount for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every other commentator and I are human. I will, of course, make every attempt to be faithful and reliable. Still, we all have our biases, blind spots, and mistaken conclusions.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I assert a fact, I will try to back it up with a citation. When I offer an opinion or speculation, I will try to disclose that also. After each lesson, I will include a list of works cited. I encourage everyone to never take my word for it but validate what I say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acts 17:11 tells us the Biblical model is to &amp;ldquo;trust but verify.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is up to the reader to do your research and verify that any facts and conclusions are scriptural.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all called to &amp;ldquo;be Bereans.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-understand-the-intended-audience&#34;&gt;#4 Understand the intended audience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bible, including the Book of Revelation, was written FOR us but not TO us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are operating under the assumption that the Apostle John wrote Revelation, likely between 90-95 CE&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He was instructed to share it with seven specific Messianic communities/congregations.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note we should not say &amp;ldquo;seven churches&amp;rdquo; because no such thing as a &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; existed in 95.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reason for the apocalypse was to provide hope for the faithful during the intense persecution of the Roman Emperor Domitian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Bible is written &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; us in the sense of 2 Timothy 3:16-17. All Scripture is inspired by God and useful &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; teaching, &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; reproof, &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; restoration, and &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; training in righteousness, 17. so that the person belonging to God may be capable, fully equipped &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; every good deed.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teaching/doctrine = what &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reproof = what is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restoration/correction = how to &lt;strong&gt;get&lt;/strong&gt; right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Training in righteousness/instruction = how to &lt;strong&gt;stay&lt;/strong&gt; right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-understand-revelation-is-a-jewish-book&#34;&gt;#5 Understand Revelation is a Jewish book&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revelation is a Jewish book. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s really Jewish. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s the most Jewish book in our New Testament&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This fact is why we as Gentiles often have trouble understanding Revelation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The symbolism can be baffling since we likely won&amp;rsquo;t have the background in the Hebrew Scriptures that John&amp;rsquo;s original audience had.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are 404 verses in Revelation, but there are allusions to over 800 Old Testament verses. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, John never directly quotes any other verse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Psalms, and Deuteronomy are frequently alluded to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation 1:3 promises a blessing for those who hear and obey what has been written.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the exact nature of the blessing is not stated, a thorough study of Revelation will take us into nearly every other book of the Bible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a blessing when we study God&amp;rsquo;s word. The Jewish sages see Bible study as worship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proverbs 3:13-14: Happy (blessed) is the man who finds wisdom and the man who gains understanding. For her trade-value is better than silver, and her yield better than fine gold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will call attention to many of these references as we go verse-by-verse through Revelation Backgrounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewish imagery is everywhere: Jewish prophecy, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Sukkot, Palm Branches, Shofars, Menorahs, books of judgment, the Book of Life, liturgical functions and ceremonies about the Temple in Jerusalem, etc.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We assume that John wrote this between 90-95 CE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is significant as it would have been &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the Roman destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John drew from a time in Israel&amp;rsquo;s history where a nearly identical event happened: the destruction of the First Temple in 586 BCE by the Babylonians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing this allows us to frame John&amp;rsquo;s references to Babylon in their proper context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we approach Revelation and ignore its Jewishness, we will find it difficult, if not impossible, to understand.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But if we are Bereans and search the Scriptures, we will discover Revelation significantly demystified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For this reason, we will be presenting verses from Revelation and other books from the &amp;ldquo;Complete Jewish Bible&amp;rdquo; (CJB).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CJB is a translation by Dr. David H. Stern that seeks to &amp;ldquo;present the Bible (Old and New Testaments) as a complete Jewish book and connect readers with the Jewishness of the Messiah.&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It also seeks to correct anachronisms, such as the label &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; in the New Testament before such an entity ever existed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-be-suspicious-if-an-interpretation-could-not-have-occurred-to-the-original-audience&#34;&gt;#6 Be suspicious if an interpretation could not have occurred to the original audience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If an interpretation would not or could not have occurred to John or his audience, we will treat it with a degree of healthy suspicion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The historical aspect tends to get the least attention from other Protestant-based commentators.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, how the events described in Revelation relate to what was happening in John&amp;rsquo;s Day will be our primary focus with Revelation Backgrounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many interpretations may appear to &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo;; they just may not fit within our scope. We want to stay focused on the 1st-century context as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Healthy suspicion doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we reject it outright just because it was beyond the scope of the original audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is perfectly capable of delivering a message that is just as relevant for us as it was to the original audience.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, the &amp;ldquo;seven letters&amp;rdquo; have many layers of understanding and application (admittedly, some are concrete while others are speculative).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no reason why multiple layers of interpretation can&amp;rsquo;t be correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;7-acknowledge-that-fear-is-not-from-god&#34;&gt;#7 Acknowledge that fear is not from God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear is not from God&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fear not,&amp;rdquo; or an equivalent, is one of the most frequently repeated commands in the Bible.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Mathew 10:28, Jesus said the only fear we should have is the fear of God, a healthy fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Far too many approach Revelation with a spirit of fear; may it not be so with us!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We must always apply &amp;ldquo;Acts 17:11 logic&amp;rdquo; to any potential interpretation.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the given interpretation consistent with the rest of the Scriptures?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does it magnify Yeshua (Jesus) the Messiah?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does it give us a spirit of peace?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we are left fearful of anyone or anything besides God, then the interpretation/application is not from God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;no-fear-means-avoiding-frontpage-exegesis&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;No Fear&amp;rdquo; means avoiding &amp;ldquo;Frontpage Exegesis&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media loves fear. Fear sells. If it bleeds, it leads. Yet we just said that fear is not from God. Fear should not be a factor in our attempts to understand Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Exegesis&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracting concepts from the biblical text while applying reasonable academic inquiry techniques&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&amp;ldquo;Frontpage&amp;rdquo; Exegesis&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing every sensational headline or significant current as a fulfillment of biblical prophecy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation is NOT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A crystal ball to predict the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A description of current events in the 21st century&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A chronological, linear sequence of end-time events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A literal narrative, but neither is it an allegory
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember this: &lt;strong&gt;Revelation is not an allegory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frontpage exegesis intentionally or unintentionally allegorizes Scripture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem with an allegory is that we can twist it to mean anything we want it to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For context, if we were to study Christian writings during WWI, a large segment of Christians believed they were living in the days of Revelation. Some even quit their jobs, stopped having children, and even committed suicide.
&lt;img src=&#34;images/frontpage_exegesis.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;20%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During WWII, many thought Hitler was the Antichrist (not entirely without reason).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1988, one person was &lt;em&gt;so sure&lt;/em&gt; the rapture was going to occur that year, he published a book, &amp;ldquo;88 Reasons Why the Rapture will be in 1988,&amp;rdquo; and then had the audacity to say &amp;ldquo;if I&amp;rsquo;m wrong, the Bible is wrong.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over the last decade, the Beast was &amp;ldquo;obviously&amp;rdquo; Donald Trump or Barack Obama, depending on your political viewpoint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone throughout history who has claimed that he or she was living out the events prophesied by Revelation has been wrong. That&amp;rsquo;s the problem with Frontpage Exegesis. It&amp;rsquo;s always been wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; fair to say, &amp;ldquo;Revelation describes literal events using signs/symbolic language.&amp;rdquo; We&amp;rsquo;ll talk more about some of these signs below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;revelation-metadata&#34;&gt;Revelation &amp;ldquo;metadata&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s look at the &amp;ldquo;who, what, when, where&amp;rdquo; of Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;who-wrote-revelation&#34;&gt;Who wrote Revelation?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 1:1-2 This is the Revelation which God gave to Yeshua the Messiah so that he could show his servants what must happen very soon. He communicated it by sending his angel to his servant &lt;mark&gt;Yochanan (John)&lt;/mark&gt;, 2. who bore witness to the Word of God and to the testimony of Yeshua the Messiah, as much as he saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note the progression of transmission: God → Jesus → His angel/messenger → John → Jesus&amp;rsquo; servants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ultimate Author is God
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation is not just &amp;ldquo;divinely inspired&amp;rdquo; but is &amp;ldquo;divinely given.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divinely inspired – the Holy Spirit guided the words, but the structure, choice of words, what aspects to include, what to omit, and other stylistic details were at the discretion of the human author&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divinely given – the words, what to include/omit, and so forth came directly from God. The human author was primarily a transcriber and copy editor
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation is the only New Testament book that is divinely given; all others are divinely-inspired&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the Torah, the first five books of Moses, are divinely given (The phrase, &amp;ldquo;The LORD spoke to Moses and said, &amp;lsquo;Thus shall you say to the Children of Israel…&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; appears frequently.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John wrote down the words of the angel/messenger unless he was told not to (Revelation 10:4)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While we can&amp;rsquo;t prove it beyond all doubt, the evidence is convincing that Revelation&amp;rsquo;s (human) author is John the Apostle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, the author is John, the &lt;em&gt;talmid&lt;/em&gt; (disciple) of Yeshua, the author of the Gospel of John, and the three epistles that bear his name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One additional piece of evidence is the phrase &amp;ldquo;bore witness.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This type of legal/courtroom terminology is all over the Gospel of John.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John presents evidence that Yeshua/Jesus is the rightful authority for Israel and the good shepherd. In addition, John also bears witness that the Jerusalem religious establishment is unauthorized and its leaders are the &amp;ldquo;bad shepherds&amp;rdquo; over Israel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;when-and-where-was-revelation-written&#34;&gt;When and where was Revelation written?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 1:9 I, John, your brother and fellow partaker with you in the tribulation and kingdom and patient endurance that are in Yeshua, was on &lt;mark&gt;the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Yeshua&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/e45914e26cc0be101f69fd4d54a746be.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iraneus, the earliest source who cited the Apostle John as the author, also stated that he wrote during the worldwide persecution of Jews and Christians of Emperor Domitian. Domitian was also responsible for exiling John to Patmos.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The small island of Patmos is about 7.5 miles (12 km) long from north to south and at its widest is 6 miles (10 km) from east to west.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian was the Roman Emperor from 81-96.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most conservative scholars believe Revelation was written between 90-95.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    For information on exactly how John ended up in Patmos &amp;ldquo;because of the Word of God and Testimony of Yeshua,&amp;rdquo; see our Revelation Backgrounds Supplement &amp;ldquo;Historical Background of John&amp;rsquo;s Exile.&amp;rdquo;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-was-revelation-written&#34;&gt;How was Revelation written?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 1:1b: He &lt;mark&gt;communicated it&lt;/mark&gt; by sending His angel to His servant Yochanan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Greek word for &amp;ldquo;communicated it&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;made it known&amp;rdquo; is &lt;em&gt;σημαίνω&lt;/em&gt; to signify, literally &amp;ldquo;render into signs.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We might say &amp;ldquo;encoded.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missler writes, &amp;ldquo;Revelation is in code, but every code is explained elsewhere in Scripture!&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every sign in the Bible points to something – in the case of Revelation, the signs point to the climax of God&amp;rsquo;s plan for Man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Readers familiar with the Old Testament would have understood what these signs represented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will get more comfortable with John&amp;rsquo;s communication as we dig into the Hebrew Scriptures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sevens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another way Revelation is &amp;ldquo;signified&amp;rdquo; is through repetitive patterns, specifically the number seven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sevens are conspicuous in Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In biblical thought, seven is the number that denotes &amp;quot; completion,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;finality,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;perfection.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Shabbat (7th day) is a day of peace, joy, and rest; the Messianic Kingdom is often described as entering into the (Sabbath) peace/joy/rest of God&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This comes from Genesis 2:1-3
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So the heavens and the earth were completed along with their entire array. 2. God completed—on the seventh day—His work that He made, and He ceased—on the seventh day—from all His work that He made. 3. Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, for on it He ceased from all His work that God created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of the seven patterns are obvious (congregations, seals, trumpets, bowls), while others are less noticeable.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The depiction of Messiah in chapter 1 has seven features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each letter to a congregation in chapters 2-3 contains seven components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are seven &amp;ldquo;blessings&amp;rdquo; (or beatitudes) scattered throughout the book, beginning with the blessing to the one who reads and obeys the words at Revelation 1:3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;to-whom-was-revelation-written&#34;&gt;To whom was Revelation written?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 1:4: From: Yochanan To: The seven Messianic communities in the province of Asia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John, at the time, was over the congregation in Ephesus and had responsibility for the other six nearby assemblies: Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are circled on the map, along with John&amp;rsquo;s location on Patmos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John was tasked with shepherding his flocks through this tumultuous time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    The term &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; is an anachronism
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;images/seven_congregations.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At this point, you may be asking, &amp;ldquo;why aren&amp;rsquo;t you using the word &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo;? I thought they were the &amp;ldquo;seven churches of Revelation?&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can say with reasonable certainty that the name of the building where 1st-century believers in Asia met was called a synagogue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These communities or congregations were predominately Jewish but had their share of gentile believers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t recommend calling them &amp;ldquo;churches&amp;rdquo; because the &amp;ldquo;church,&amp;rdquo; either a building or an organizational structure, did not exist in the first century.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anachronism&lt;/strong&gt;: the misappropriation of concepts and ideas in time.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When an actor in a movie set in the Middle Ages is wearing a digital watch, or there&amp;rsquo;s a car visible on a street that is supposed to occur during the civil war, that&amp;rsquo;s an anachronism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anachronistic fallacy&lt;/strong&gt;: when one purposely or inadvertently &lt;strong&gt;asserts or infers a concept&lt;/strong&gt; based on an anachronism.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; didn&amp;rsquo;t exist yet in the first century, every time we translate &amp;ldquo;ecclesia&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; in the New Testament, that&amp;rsquo;s an anachronistic fallacy.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fact, the word &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; in any form or language doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear until around the mid-5th Century CE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Greek word &lt;em&gt;ecclesia&lt;/em&gt;, later translated as &amp;ldquo;church,&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;called out assembly,&amp;rdquo; or in a religious context, &amp;ldquo;congregation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;ecclesia&lt;/em&gt; is about people, not an institution, yet this is not what usually comes to our mind when we see the word &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; in our Bibles. We tend to associate &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;a building or collection of (non-Jewish) worshippers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John, a Jew, wrote to Jewish congregations attended by Jews and gentiles. In the early to mid 90s, they assembled in synagogues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;To whom was the revelation &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; given?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus! This has some interesting theological implications, as there were apparently things Jesus didn&amp;rsquo;t know even after his Resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 1:1 The Revelation of Yeshua the Messiah, which God gave &lt;strong&gt;Him&lt;/strong&gt; to show to His servants the things that must soon take place. He made it known by sending His angel to His servant John,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-was-revelation-written&#34;&gt;Why was Revelation written?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 1:7 &lt;mark&gt;Look! He is coming with the clouds! Every eye will see him&lt;/mark&gt;, including those who pierced Him, and all the tribes of the Land will mourn him. Yes! Amen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We mentioned above how the purpose of apocalyptic literature was to give the faithful hope during times of tribulation. No matter what happens here on earth, we always have the hope of his return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zechariah 14:4 reminds us that when he returns, His &amp;ldquo;feet will stand on the Mount of Olives.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the end of the day, Revelation is about God fixing what man and Satan have messed up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whereas we saw the entrance of sin, the curse, and death in Genesis, we will see the end of sin (chapter 21), no more condemnation (chapter 22), and no more death (chapter 21).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like Steven Covey says, &amp;ldquo;Begin with the end in mind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No matter how murky or mysterious Revelation may be, ultimately, it is about the Glory of God and restoration of Man to the state that God originally intended for us in Eden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation reminds us, &amp;ldquo;victory depends on Christ&amp;rsquo;s finished work, not on human circumstances (and) that the imminent hope of His return is worth more than all the world&amp;rsquo;s goods.&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amen!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am excited to dig into this book. I&amp;rsquo;ve studied it many times, but this will be the first time diving into using messianic and other cultural background commentaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we begin, remember the &amp;ldquo;Seven Keys to Interpretation&amp;rdquo; we listed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will have a separate segment to review the relevant history before John receives the Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if history wasn&amp;rsquo;t your best subject, I encourage you to view this supplement. Understanding this extra-biblical background turns out to be highly relevant to our studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, we&amp;rsquo;ll see you for Revelation chapter 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically Jewish apocalyptic literature fall into a category called pseudopigrapha – writings falsely ascribed to someone else describing a vision that person had. For example, the Book of (First) Enoch probably dates to 200-100 BCE (long after the Biblical Enoch was taken by God in Genesis 5). Revelation follows the genre of 1 Enoch, but it is also different because we are confident it came directly from God through John the Apostle.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believers need not be bothered by the &amp;ldquo;BCE/CE&amp;rdquo; (Before Common Era/Common Era) designations in place of &amp;ldquo;BC&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;AD&amp;rdquo;. They mean the same things. Saying BCE/CE is less offensive particularly to Jewish people. It is a chance to love our neighbors and live out Romans 12:18 (&amp;ldquo;If possible, so far as it depends on you, live in &lt;em&gt;shalom&lt;/em&gt; with all people&amp;rdquo;). Besides, when the Catholic Church established the BC/AD system in the Middle Ages, they made a math error. We now know that Yeshua was most likely born 5 or 4 BCE. Saying &amp;ldquo;Jesus Christ was born in the year 5 Before Christ&amp;rdquo; is non-sensical when you think about it!&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In THE LOGOS We see the revelation of the Apostle John, a first-century Galilean Jew, of the Word becoming flesh. To understand his words, we need to understand them from a first-century Galilean Jewish perspective. Jesus brings the revelation and glory of God into the world of men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospels are Jewish documents. 1st Century “Christianity” was a Jewish sect.
John is often viewed as contrasting the correct way of Christianity with the incorrect way of Judaism, but this represents what is called an anachronistic fallacy, often shortened to “Anachronism” - misappropriation of concepts and ideas in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sometimes see inadvertent anachronisms in period-piece movies. An actor playing a cowboy might be wearing a digital watch in a movie set in the 18th century.  In the movie “Back to the Future,” at the 1955 enchantment under the sea dance, Marty McFly is playing a 1958 Gibson guitar.  Of course, something made in 1958 would not have existed in 1955.  That’s an anachronism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a challenge to restrain our own presuppositions, our set of established beliefs, when we read the Bible.  It is natural to assume a biblical speaker to affirm our presuppositions in order to justify our positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overarching anachronistic fallacy many commentators commit is to take what is called “the parting of the ways” between Judaism and Christianity that occurred much later (2nd-4th centuries CE) and reading it back into this text in the 1st century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, since it had not occurred yet, there is absolutely no way John or any other biblical writer could have the split between Judaism and Christianity in view when they were writing.  Even to say something like “the 12 Apostles were Christians” is an anachronism.  Since the term “Christian” hadn’t been coined yet, they would have viewed themselves as Jewish followers of their Jewish Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next term is “Presuppositions,” which refers to those things we have accepted as true without needing external verification.  It can a challenge to restrain our own presuppositions, our set of established beliefs, when we read the Bible.  If we are taught something over and over, we naturally accept that thing as true and don’t challenge it.  Most of the time this poses no issue, but problems can arise when what we accept as true, may not be true, or at least not true in every specific application.  For example, when we read the Bible, we often subconsciously assume a biblical speaker affirms all of our presuppositions.  For example, if I have been taught that Jesus had combative exchanges with ALL religious leaders, then when I read the Bible, I’m going to read all exchanges between Jesus and the religious leaders as combative.  I will draw this conclusion even when a plain, surface reading of the text doesn’t necessarily support such a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I superimpose my presuppositions into the biblical text, we call that &amp;ldquo;eisegesis.&amp;rdquo;  Modern conservative scholars would all agree that eisegesis is bad yet many of us do it almost automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we strive for is EXEGESIS, understanding the text IN CONTEXT to extract what the author was saying.  To do this, we must first realize the gospels are Jewish documents written within a historical context of 2nd Temple Judaism.  The audience were Jewish Christ followers together with many non-Jews who had joined a Jewish sect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early church fathers affirmed John’s authorship of this Gospel strongly and unanimously. Some of the fathers claim to have personally known those who knew John in Ephesus in his later years, thus making a direct link to the tradition of Johannine authorship. The evangelist John is shown here with the symbol of an eagle, the one of the four living creatures which is traditionally associated with him (Ezekiel 1:5-10 and Revelation 4:6-7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-11&#34;&gt;John 1:1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logos in the normal sense means “word or speech”.  In this prologue, John uses it in the mystical sense.  He alludes directly to the beginning of the Torah and the beginning of creation.  He starts this with an intentional allusion to Genesis 1:1 “In the beginning”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-12-6&#34;&gt;John 1:2-6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. 6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall the first act of Creation. “and God said Let there be Light, and there was light.”&lt;br&gt;
In verse 4  John declares that this life had always been available through God’s word, which is the same word that he identifies with Jesus (IVP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John 1:5, The divine light from the first day of creation shines once again into the dark world of man, signifying a new creation (COM)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excavations in the early 2000s revealed this cave west of Jerusalem near Ein Kerem. Archaeologist Shimon Gibson identified it with the ministry of John the Baptist on the basis of a stick-figure drawing of a man inside the cave. Gibson’s theory was published in The Cave of John the Baptist (Doubleday, 2004).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For responses, see that by James F. Strange (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/reviews/the-cave-of-john-the-baptist/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/reviews/the-cave-of-john-the-baptist/&lt;/a&gt;) and Todd Bolen (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bibleplaces.com/cave-of-john-the-baptist/%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://www.bibleplaces.com/cave-of-john-the-baptist/)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the writing of the church father Origen (AD 185-254), the location of John’s baptizing at Bethany beyond the Jordan has been located at a point near the river opposite Jericho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-17&#34;&gt;John 1:7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;7  He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some scholars note that John has a “legal” feel.  As you read John&amp;rsquo;s gospel, be on the lookout for the terms Witness, Testimony, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, John is interested not only in establishing Jesus’ credentials, he is also interested in “convicting” the corrupt Jerusalem establishment on the grounds of usurption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/01-the_logos_files/01.Picture7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;30%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discovered in Cave 4 of Qumran in the early 1950s, this text contains five biblical verses that focused on the coming of the Messiah. This artifact was photographed in the Amman Museum.&lt;br&gt;
A few scholars suspect John may have been part of the Essene sect, but in any case he was definitely influenced by them.  The Essenes believed that the forces controlling Jerusalem and the Temple were usurpers and priests of darkness.  They juxtaposed darkness and light just as John does throughout his writings.   “in the Dead Sea Scrolls, the forces of light and darkness were engaged in mortal combat, but light was predestined to triumph” (IVP)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-18-13&#34;&gt;John 1:8-13&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;8 He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light. 9 The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. 11 He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. 12 But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, 13 who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is a spiritual rebirth, not relying on our ethnic descent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerusalem was the home of David and place where his greater Son was appointed to rule over the nation.  John uses a term Ioudaioi, which get’s translated as “jews” but many scholars believe this is too generic.  Think of the term “Americans” -The Americans won the Gold medal in 1980 (a group of 20 hockey players).  The Americans invaded Normandy (those members of the Army and the Navy in June 1944).  The Americans imposed Tariffs on China (specifically referring to the Government).  The Americans pay their taxes on April 15 (most Americans but not all - children don’t pay taxes).  The Americans are guaranteed freedoms under the Constitution (all Americans)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the term &amp;ldquo;Jews&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot; could be anywhere from All Jews - which we know is not in view here because the 1st Century church was nearly 100% Jewish.   Unfortunately many commentators, view it as exactly this: John is an early Christian Anti-Jewish document.  It is more likely that what is in view is not rejection by all-Israel, but rather rejection by a sub-group within Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What might some of these sub-groups be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could maybe refer those in Judea who generally rejected as opposed to those in Galilee where Jesus was largely accepted. But even here, not all Judeans rejected him.  Nicodemus for example.  Several scholars believe Ioudaoi specifically refers to the ruling establishment, which for the most part wanted Jesus out of the picture.  Again Nicodemus is an exception and there were probably others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many commentaries place the blame on all Israel, which could be painting with too broad of a brush.  It would be like holding all 300 million Americans responsible for something done by a small group of corrupt politicians in Washington DC.  With that said, a national guilt might also be in view- America is a sinful and unrepentant nation, even though many Americans do repent of their sin.  Deuteronomy 9:23 states, “You rebelled against the command of the LORD your God; you neither believed Him nor listened to His voice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, we must allow God to own the business of judgment.   it is wrong to use our holy book to specifically condemn a group of people (as the church as done to Jews for the last 2000 years).  We are to love our neighbors and pray for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish thought of the day was that to be a true Child of God, one had to be a Child of Abraham, either through birth or conversion (even today, Ben Avraham is a common name a gentile takes when converting to Judaism).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John is setting the stage that it is not ethnic affiliation but spiritual rebirth that matters.  A topic that will be developed in John Chapter 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-114-15&#34;&gt;John 1:14-15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;14  And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. 15  (John bore witness about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A father’s only son” would remind readers of Genesis 22, where God instructed Abraham “take your son, your only son whom you love, Isaac&amp;hellip;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/01-the_logos_files/01.Picture8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:left&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The star in the Church of Nativity in Bethlehem marks the spot where tradition says that Mary gave birth to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the Greek mind, the invisible spiritual real is far superior to the earthly realm.  However, God created man spirit and flesh.  Our flesh only became corrupt AFTER the fall.  God intended there to be a union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verb translated above as “dwelt” (skenoo) is related to the Greek word for “tabernacle” (skene). Just as God dwelt with his people in the tabernacle, so the Word tabernacled with his people in the incarnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-11618&#34;&gt;John 1:16:18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;16 For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. 17 For (as) the (Torah) was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 18 No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father&amp;rsquo;s side, he has made him known.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 17 is often translated “for the law came through Moses &lt;em&gt;BUT&lt;/em&gt; Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “BUT” is a mistranslation (possibly intentional) - it is not in the Greek.  John just got through saying that Jesus was there in the beginning.  This means Grace and Truth where there in the beginning.  The Law has a special role to play for the nation of Israel but it is not in any way antithetical to the Gospel of Jesus.  John sees Jesus as affirming the covenant promises God made in the Torah.  A better reading might be “for AS the Torah was given through Moses, Grace and Truth came through Jesus Christ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “but” originally occurred in the King James Version.  The anachronistic error here involves the 16th Century division between Protestants and Catholics regarding the function of the law in the life of the believer.  One of the Reformation cries was “Faith alone”.  It wasn’t until Luther that “Law” and “Grace” became opposites.  Superimposing this view on the Biblical Text is simply not correct.  The oppose of Law is lawlessness.  The oppose of grace is disgrace.  It is wrong to view any part of the Bible as lawless or disgraceful!  God’s Law is a good and beautiful thing.  Read Psalm 119!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;How can anachronisms and eisegesis be a problem in my studies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways does John 1:1-5 parallel Genesis 1 and how does that change my thinking of Genesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I think “His own” in verse 11 refers to all Jews?  Why or why not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did my opinionAs I reflect on the “tabernacle” discussion in John 1:14, how does (or how should) this affect my walk with Jesus?
change after this lesson?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did my understanding of the Law/Old Testament change after studying 1:17?  How can I apply this going forward?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a supplement to our Revelation background series. We&amp;rsquo;re essentially going to take a look at significant events in the period between the Jewish Revolt of 66CE, including the destruction of the Jewish Temple in 70, through the mid-90s that resulted in John&amp;rsquo;s exile on Patmos, where he received the Revelation. Even if history wasn&amp;rsquo;t your best subject in school, I think you&amp;rsquo;ll find this helpful as we prepare to study Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/12dbc6729425b0146e399d1142ecde75.png&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than Jesus predicting the temple&amp;rsquo;s destruction in Luke 21, all of this is drawn from extra-biblical sources. Much of it is verifiable from historical documents. Still, some of it is based on church tradition that was likely passed on orally before it was written down several centuries later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church father, Iraneus, was only one generation removed from John the Apostle. Iraneus in &lt;em&gt;ecclesiastical history¸&lt;/em&gt;is the earliest source that tells us that John the Apostle wrote Revelation and did so from Patmos because the Roman Emperor Domitian exiled him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domitian&amp;rsquo;s persecution turns out to be critically important if we are to put Revelation in context. The following is summarized mainly from Cargill&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Jerusalem the Holy City&lt;/em&gt; course&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and Lancaster&amp;rsquo;s series &lt;em&gt;Apocalypse of John&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Chronicles of the Apostles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The years following Jesus&amp;rsquo; Resurrection and Ascension were a tumultuous time for Israel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The governors that followed Pontius Pilate went from bad to worse, as did the Herods that took over for Antipas and Phillip, notably Agrippa I and Agrippa II&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With this came increased talk of rebellion and hopes for a Messianic deliverer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In many Jew&amp;rsquo;s minds, the Messiah will deliver the people from captivity and establish a literal political kingdom, just like Moses did during the Exodus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since Jesus didn&amp;rsquo;t do that, He couldn&amp;rsquo;t be the promised deliverer&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;False messiahs were abundant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This led to what is known as the &amp;ldquo;First Jewish Revolt&amp;rdquo; in 66 CE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-jewish-revolt-nero-vespasian-and-josephus&#34;&gt;The Jewish Revolt: Nero, Vespasian, and Josephus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/3feaa830cafd78dd620f3f1cbab7887f.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;25%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 66 CE, during the time of Emperor Nero (famous for his own persecutions and insanity), there was open rebellion; a Roman General named Vespasian (pictured at right) was sent with Roman Legions V, X, and XV to quash it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josephus predicts greatness for Vespasian.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During one battle in the north of Israel, Vespasian captured a Jewish general named Yosef ben Mattiyahu, who later became known as Flavius Josephus.&lt;img src=&#34;images/408d47525f6d48efcea99f82468abd74.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;25%&#34; style=&#34;float:left&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As he was about to be executed, Josephus said to Vespasian something along the lines of, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not really a general. I&amp;rsquo;m a prophet, and one day you&amp;rsquo;re going to be the emperor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most Roman leaders were extraordinarily superstitious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naturally, what this man said was pleasing to Vespasian&amp;rsquo;s ears; therefore, Josephus was allowed to live as an enslaved person. He authored two large volumes of Jewish history up to that point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 69, while dealing with the Jewish rebellion, Vespasian was recalled to Rome, where he was indeed named emperor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josephus also told Vespasian that amid all this Jewish messianic enthusiasm, it was &lt;em&gt;Vespasian and his line&lt;/em&gt; who fulfilled the Jewish prophecies about the coming Messiah, not some Jewish person from the house of David.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After Vespasian became emperor, they took Jewish prophecies very seriously!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josephus was still very much in the picture some 10-20 years later, when Vespasian&amp;rsquo;s son Domitian took over the Roman Empire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josephus is viewed as a traitor to the Jews for his actions.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to legend, a group of generals entered into a suicide pact rather than be captured.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josephus conveniently drew the proverbial last straw and was tasked with killing the last man and then himself. He obviously took another way when he presented himself to Vespasian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vespasian&amp;rsquo;s son Titus ultimately was successful in putting down the rebellion.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 70, he besieged and sacked Jerusalem and destroyed the Temple stone-by-stone, just as Jesus had predicted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 72, he rooted out the last Jewish holdouts at a place called Masada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those Jews who were not slaughtered were forced into exile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Jews would not have a homeland to call their own until 1948.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2nd-temple-destruction-fulfills-prophecy&#34;&gt;2nd Temple Destruction Fulfills Prophecy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/60576df31e34f2c3e4538d7811953bdc.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
Luke 19:41-44 As He drew near and saw Jerusalem, He wept over her, 42. saying, &#34;If only you had recognized this day the things that lead to shalom! But now they are hidden from your eyes. 43. For the days will come upon you when your enemies will surround you with barricades and hem you in on all sides. 44. And they will smash you to the ground—you and your children within you. And they won&#39;t leave within you one stone upon another because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus&amp;rsquo; words about the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple were fulfilled in 70 CE
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indeed, not one stone was left upon another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A visit to the Temple Mount area in Jerusalem today reveals these massive stones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on the indentations in the surrounding pavement, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to conclude that they fell from the top of the temple mount above (note the person in the upper left corner for a sense of the size of the stones!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archaeologists date these stones to the 1st century and the destruction of Jerusalem by the Roman army.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The destruction of the &amp;ldquo;2nd Temple&amp;rdquo; is critical in Jewish history.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The destruction of the 1st Temple in 586 BCE was another such moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In one of those quirks of history, both destructions happened on the same day on the Jewish Calendar, the 9th day of the Jewish month of Av.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since then, several calamities have happened on that date, and to this day, the 9th of Av is a day of mourning and fasting for the Jewish People.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;roman-aftermath-vespasian-and-titus&#34;&gt;Roman aftermath: Vespasian and Titus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The destruction of the Temple was a severe blow to the hopes and aspirations of Jews
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the second time in their history, God&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;chosen people&amp;rdquo; had been decimated, exiled, and seen God&amp;rsquo;s house overrun by a pagan empire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;How could an all-powerful, all-loving God let this happen? What will we do next?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first time it happened was in 586 BCE at the hands of the Babylonians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE, Emperor Vespasian did two things to teach a lesson to this rebellious people.
&lt;img src=&#34;images/41894ca448ddd5df916ab6bc1f1e5491.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
-   This tax only applied to Jews.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He imposed a &lt;em&gt;fiscus Iudaicus&lt;/em&gt; (a Jewish Tax).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a further insult, the tax went to the upkeep of the pagan Temple of Jupiter/Zeus, which stood where the Jewish Temple once did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ancient cultures, putting your holy site over someone else&amp;rsquo;s holy site was the ultimate in &amp;ldquo;smack talk&amp;rdquo;; it communicates, &amp;ldquo;your God is vanquished.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some Jews (both followers and non-followers of Yeshua) &amp;ldquo;renounced&amp;rdquo; their faith to avoid the tax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He &amp;ldquo;gave orders that everyone who belonged to the lineage of David should be sought out that none of the royal race might be left among the Jews.&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Titus succeeded Vespasian in 79 but only reigned two years before he died of a fever.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Arch of Titus&amp;rdquo; stands in Rome today as a tribute to his victory over the Jews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/61a7daa2ad04e35e37a8668a756e01d0.png&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empathy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to put ourselves in the Jew&amp;rsquo;s shoes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our God is supposed to be all-powerful with a special place in His heart for His people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet not once but twice, God&amp;rsquo;s house, the holiest place on earth, has been overrun by idol-worshipping pagans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moreover, in the case of the first temple, God made an unconditional covenant with David that appears to have been broken. What do you do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is your God not who He says He is? Maybe he&amp;rsquo;s not that powerful. Perhaps He doesn&amp;rsquo;t love us. Maybe we sinned so severely he had no choice but to break his promise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you do when what you believe to be true is so blatantly contradicted by the evidence?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you walk away from your faith? A lot did, I&amp;rsquo;m sure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you say God would have protected us, but our people were so bad they deserved it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you say that maybe we misread or misunderstood the promises?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of people did a combination of these things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psychologists use the term &amp;ldquo;cognitive dissonance&amp;rdquo; for those times when what you believe, what you have been taught all your life doesn&amp;rsquo;t match your reality. According to Cargill, this is what the Jews in exile after the destruction of the First Temple were experiencing.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And let us not be so glib as to say, &amp;ldquo;Jesus did away with the temple.&amp;rdquo; Or &amp;ldquo;the Jews rejected Jesus, so they got what was coming.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not that simple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first apostles met in the Temple every day, and the temple was also important to Paul.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Temple was a big deal to all Jews, including those who accepted Jesus as their Messiah&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of all, they mourned.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the First Temple was destroyed, we get passages like Psalms 137.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When God&amp;rsquo;s people mourn, God listens.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the first temple destruction and the people were scattered to a foreign land, the Babylon Empire, God, sent apocalyptic visions to prophets like Ezekiel and Daniel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should not surprise us that we get a similar apocalyptic vision after the second temple was destroyed and God&amp;rsquo;s people were scattered throughout the Roman empire. This time God would make it through John the Apostle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But first, we need to talk about another Nero figure named Domitian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;domitian&#34;&gt;Domitian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the short time Titus was emperor, he softened his father&amp;rsquo;s hard-line positions, particularly concerning political prisoners. Presumably, this also included an easing of enforcement efforts on the two anti-Jewish programs instituted by his father.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All that would change under Domitian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian (emperor from 81-96) reinstituted the two programs of Vespasian &amp;ldquo;with the utmost rigor&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, In Rome, worship of the imperial cult was viewed as a symbol of loyalty to the Roman state. This included worshipping a statue or image of the emperor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whereas Vespasian and Titus weren&amp;rsquo;t significantly &amp;ldquo;religious,&amp;rdquo; Domitian, by the Josephus prophecy, believed himself to be the promised one sent by the gods. He thus demanded worship while he was still alive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He set up a temple to himself and demanded to be addressed as &amp;ldquo;my master, my lord, my god, Domitian.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is in addition to Rome&amp;rsquo;s general paranoia about foreign religions, particularly those like Judaism, whose proponents denounced Rome&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster says something significant here: &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;this fantasy made him all the more worthy of the title of antichrist.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now add to the mix that numerous gentiles throughout the empire were coming to faith in Yeshua.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul and the early leadership decided that gentiles should not be required to convert to Judaism as a condition of being accepted into the assembly (see Acts 15).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The unintended consequence meant that these converts were not Jewish and didn&amp;rsquo;t have to pay the tax&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the eyes of Domitian, they had exploited what we might call &amp;ldquo;a tax loophole.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They could worship the Jewish Messiah in a Jewish congregation but still not pay the Jewish tax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian expected to find Jewish tax evaders and deal with them accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He was not expecting to find the amounts of non-Jews throughout the empire who had forsaken Roman gods to drift into Jewish ways&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The conversions, in combination with the &amp;ldquo;tax loophole&amp;rdquo; problem, sent Domitian into a rage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People in his household were even part of this strange new religion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although Judaism was a recognized religion in the empire, it was only legal for Jews to practice it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian initially turned his wrath on the Jews for aiding and abetting these non-Jews.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to him, it was their fault for spreading and proselytizing to non-Jews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He started by banishing all Jews from the city of Rome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of them naturally protested, saying, &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not all Jews! It&amp;rsquo;s this strange sect called the &amp;lsquo;Nazarenes.&amp;rsquo; Blame them!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian next initiated a system to weed out these &amp;ldquo;secret Jews&amp;rdquo; - being a &amp;ldquo;Christian&amp;rdquo; was now punishable by death&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-believing Jews were required to become informants on their messianic brethren&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specifically, Keener notes that synagogues in Asia (modern Turkey) expelled Jewish Christians.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They &lt;strong&gt;accused&lt;/strong&gt; the gentiles in messianic fellowships of &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;saying they were Jews, but were not&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a religious standpoint, these people were violating the Torah&amp;rsquo;s requirement to &amp;ldquo;Love your neighbor as yourself&amp;rdquo; (Leviticus 19:18), as even the narrowest interpretation of &amp;ldquo;neighbor&amp;rdquo; would have included Gentiles who have attached themselves as &amp;ldquo;god fearers&amp;rdquo; and worshipped in synagogues alongside Jews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Nazis were not the first to do this. The Church led the Spanish Inquisition, which also required people to inform each other.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian had the same problem Torquemada and Hitler did. Who exactly was a Jew?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian&amp;rsquo;s answer was &amp;ldquo;anyone who lived like a Jew,&amp;rdquo; which included gentile followers of Yeshua.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was the first large-scale persecutions of Christian believers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The captives had one opportunity to dispel the charges.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They had to reject their Jewish ways, then bow and worship an image of the emperor and acknowledge that Domitian was &amp;ldquo;Lord of all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roman citizens who refused or were believed to be insincere were &amp;ldquo;mercifully&amp;rdquo; beheaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-citizens suffered a worse fate, up to and including crucifixion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He offered compassion to the wealthy: they could have their lives spared but would be exiled to an Island in the Mediterranean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;domitian-john-and-patmos16&#34;&gt;Domitian, John, and Patmos&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In many ways, it is not surprising that Domitian and John crossed paths since John was the last of the original &lt;em&gt;Talmidim&lt;/em&gt; of Yeshua.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian ordered the arrest and extradition of John back to Rome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are several traditions associated with John&amp;rsquo;s arrest and trial before Domitian.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When it was time to execute John, Domitian first made him drink a cup of poison, but true to Jesus&amp;rsquo;s words (Mark 16:18), the poison did not harm him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, the ancient historian Tertullian records the deaths of Peter and Paul and the attempted death of John in Rome: &amp;ldquo;John was plunged unhurt into burning oil.&amp;rdquo; Another legend was that he was shaved from head to toe first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To bring us up to the time of Revelation, &amp;ldquo;When even the cauldron did not deter John from preaching Christ, by order of Domitian, he was relegated to the Island of Patmos.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because John wouldn&amp;rsquo;t die, Domitian exercised his last legal option to exile John to Patmos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At Patmos, John received the famous Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This fulfilled Jesus&amp;rsquo; prophecy that &amp;ldquo;some of you here will not taste death until you see the Son of Man coming in Glory.&amp;rdquo; (Matthew 16:21)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, we can see that the world intended martyrdom for John, fulfilling Jesus&amp;rsquo; prediction that James and John would indeed drink Jesus&amp;rsquo; Cup of Suffering. (Matthew 20:23)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a post-script, the next emperor, Nerva, is recorded as being &amp;ldquo;wise and moderate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Nerva released all the political prisoners, and John returned to Ephesus for the remainder of his days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion-relevance-to-revelation&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Relevance to Revelation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this background, keep the following in mind as we work through Revelation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose one wanted to indirectly refer to Rome (the people who destroyed the 2nd Temple).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In that case, he/she might compare them to the people who destroyed the 1st Temple: &lt;strong&gt;Babylon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose one wanted to refer to Domitian indirectly.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In that case, he/she might compare to an emperor who had a similar style: &lt;strong&gt;Nero&lt;/strong&gt; (whose name has a mathematical equivalent of &amp;ldquo;666&amp;rdquo; – we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss when we get to Revelation 13).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose one wanted to indirectly refer to a false messiah who demanded to be worshipped as &amp;ldquo;my master, my lord, my god.&amp;rdquo; In other words, this person required people to use titles rightly reserved for Jesus.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In that case, he/she might use the term &lt;strong&gt;Antichrist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose one wanted to indirectly refer to non-believing Jewish informants, who accused believing gentiles of &amp;ldquo;saying they were Jews when they were not.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In that case, we might say they were from the &amp;ldquo;synagogue of the accuser,&amp;rdquo; or since the Hebrew word for &amp;ldquo;accuser&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;satan,&amp;rdquo; we could say they are from the &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;synagogue of Satan&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;Satan&lt;/em&gt; is Hebrew for &amp;ldquo;accuser&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This does not mean that they were worshipping Satan the way we might think of it with satanic rituals and such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could say that they were doing Satan&amp;rsquo;s bidding.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we accuse another believer, either directly or through gossip, guess what?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are acting as an &amp;ldquo;accuser of the brethren.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further, one who claimed to be Jewish but informed against his neighbor is not upholding the high ethical standards of Judaism. He is a hypocrite. He is saying he is a Jew but is not acting like one. Thus we can apply the phrase &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;those who say they are Jews but are not.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please note this is spoken ONLY against those Jews who failed to uphold the high ethical standards expected of Jews by denouncing their neighbors to the authorities. This is not an indictment against all Jews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus, as a Jew, obviously would not label Himself as one &amp;ldquo;who said He was a Jew but was not.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If one were going to praise believers who stood up to the authorities, we might say they &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Held fast to His Name&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When John was arrested and taken to Rome, he had little hope for survival.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To a Jewish mind, John was &amp;ldquo;dead&amp;rdquo; as soon as the order for extradition came. See Hebrews 11:19.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Revelation 11, when John writes of two witnesses martyred for their testimony but who God raises from the dead, John&amp;rsquo;s audience could have thought, &amp;ldquo;oh, just like He raised John from the dead.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get the idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So much of Revelation is unlocked when we understand the context. We will open more as we progress through the study.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:11&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are differing views on this. Lancaster suggests that non-Jewish believers were not liable to pay the tax. When Domitian learned of this, enforcement became the cover story for Domitian&amp;rsquo;s intense persecutions of Christians. However, the Wikipedia article, &amp;ldquo;Fiscus Judaecus,&amp;rdquo; references scholars who suggest that since neither the Romans nor the Christians themselves viewed Christianity as a separate religion, non-Jewish believers in the first century were equally subject to the tax. I&amp;rsquo;m sympathetic to both views. Perhaps it was not as big of an issue under Vespasian as it was under Domitian, which is Lancaster&amp;rsquo;s frame of reference.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2-summary&#34;&gt;Genesis 2: Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God ceases work on the seventh day, and sanctifies it as a day of rest. God forms the human body from the dust of the earth, and blows into his nostrils a “living soul.” Originally Man is a single person, but deciding that “it is not good that man be alone,” God takes a &amp;ldquo;side&amp;rdquo; from the man, forms it into a woman, and marries them to each other. Adam and Eve are placed in the Garden of Eden, and commanded not to eat from the “Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-21-3--shabbat-rest&#34;&gt;Gen 2:1-3 – Shabbat Rest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rev 21:1&lt;/sup&gt; Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Joh 19:30&lt;/sup&gt; When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, “It is finished,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rev 21:6&lt;/sup&gt; And he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Col 1:16&lt;/sup&gt; For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Eph 3:8-9&lt;/sup&gt; To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maimonides, a medieval Jewish sage states, “the Creator caused a repose to encompass the universe.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Perhaps this is when time actually began as the laws of nature were stabilized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no stated “evening and morning” for the seventh day. It was intended to be permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam and Eve’s decision disrupted this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our shabbat rest, we now look forward to the messianic age and the New heavens/New earth/New Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus promises us our Shabbat rest in Rev 21:6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 90:4 For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, or as a watch in the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages applied Psalms 90.4 to Shabbat and concluded that, since every day is as a 1000 years, there will be 6000 years of work, followed by a Shabbat rest of 1000 years corresponding to the Messianic rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 20:4 Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. Also, I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messianic Jews see a hint of this in the seven words of Genesis 1:1, which we discussed previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;בראשׁית ברא אלהים &lt;strong&gt;את&lt;/strong&gt; השׁמים ו&lt;strong&gt;את&lt;/strong&gt; הארץ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heb 4:9-11 So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God, [10] for whoever has entered God&#39;s rest has also rested from his works as God did from his. [11] Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joh 1:10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 4 has an exposition of the Shabbat rest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heb 4:1-11 Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it. [2] For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened. [3] For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, “As I swore in my wrath, ‘They shall not enter my rest,’” although his works were finished from the foundation of the world. [4] For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.” [5] And again in this passage he said, “They shall not enter my rest.” [6] Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience, [7] again he appoints a certain day, “Today,” saying through David so long afterward, in the words already quoted, “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.” [8] For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken of another day later on. [9] So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God, [10] for whoever has entered God&amp;rsquo;s rest has also rested from his works as God did from his. [11] Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer is saying that the Israelites rebelled in the wilderness and failed to enter in to the rest God had planned for them. Those who rebel against the word of Jesus were acting like Moses’ generation did.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 11:28 Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as surely as God created the first heaven and first earth and all that is within, He will one day pour out His judgment on that creation and usher in the New heaven and new earth for eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more I study about Shabbat, the more I come to the conclusion that the fact that Christians don’t observe it is we are being fed a lie by the enemy who doesn’t want us partaking in this institution of holiness and community with God and with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christianity sees the Shabbat as a difficult burden and one that Jesus did away with. If it is so burdensome, why do all Jews seem to delight in the Sabbath? We need to stop to ask why would Jesus do away with one of the 10 commandments; and if He did, what kind of Jewish messiah would violate one of the 10 commandments? Join us in our Gospels study as we will take a hard look at at the so-called Sabbath controversies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a gift from God and maybe we should think hard about whether such a gift should be ignored or declined. Some say Sunday is the Christian sabbath. You won’t find this so defined in the Bible, but let’s grant it for a moment. How many Christians truly hit pause on their lives for more than the handful of hours they may be at church on Sunday, versus a full 24-hour shutdown period?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the business of today’s world, a person feels like he or she does not have time to stop even for a single day. (In contrast) the commandment of Shabbat forces us to stop and remember who created time. Sabbath sets aside one day out of a week to remember that we serve God, not ourselves, not our jobs, and not Pharaoh.” Daniel Lancaster&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens. When no bush of the field was yet in the land and no small plant of the field had yet sprung up—for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the land, and there was no man to work the ground, and a mist was going up from the land and was watering the whole face of the ground—&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mar 13:19 For in those days there will be such tribulation as has not been from the beginning of the creation that God created until now, and never will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rom 1:19-20 For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. [20] For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liberal theologians, skeptics and critics have big problems with the narration in chapter 2 which they see as contradicting the creation story in chapter 1. You may encounter these views so it’s worth taking some time to become acquainted with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the skeptic sees no vegetation, then man created in verse 7, and then vegetation, in verse 9; all of which would be a contradiction of the order in chapter 1. As we’ve discussed, our western minds tend to be focused more on strict chronology than eastern thinking. There is nothing in this passage that textually requires verse 9 to chronologically follow verse 7. We described man; now we’re describing the Eden in which God will place man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plausible explanations that do not involve assuming different authors or errors in the text. The most basic of these is to view chapter two as God returning to the creation of Adam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s as if after chapter 2, verse 3 and the seven days of creation, someone, let’s say an angel, asked God, “can you tell me more about this man creature?” God then replies, “Sure, let me tell you more about Man. You see I’m so close to man that I use my covenant name when I interact with him.” Then God tells the story beginning with verse 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to our verse and our chronology discussion, Walton states, “the reference (in 2:5) is not to a time before day three but to the fact that agriculture was not taking place.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are reminded that there was no rain until the flood. The earth had an entirely different hydrological cycle before the Flood, which was likely still different from the environment before the Fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another facet noted by critics is that in Chapter 1 God describes Himself as “Elohim,” whereas in Chapter 2, we see the covenant name of God, the Tetragrammaton, which is typically styled as LORD in our English Bibles. (On that note, we nowhere see Jesus pronouncing this Name, so I’m not comfortable doing so. It appears Jesus honored the tradition never to pronounce this name, and instead used what are called circumlocutions). This has led these skeptics and critics to conclude that two different authors an “E” source (for Elohim) and a “Y” source composed the two “conflicting” chapters. The general name for this more liberal view of scripture is the “Documentary hypothesis” or the “Graft-Wellhausen hypothesis.” They also see a priestly (P) source and a Deuteronomic (D) source as contributing authors. In other words, Moses didn’t write the books of Moses according to the theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will see that in Mark 10 and Matthew 19, Jesus quoted from both chapters 1 and 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mar 10:3-8 He answered them, “What did Moses command you?” They said, “Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and to send her away.” [And Jesus said to them, “Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment. But from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’ [Gen 1:27] ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife and the two shall become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two but one flesh. [Gen 2:24]. In other words, Jesus quotes from the so-called “E” source (chapter 1) and the so-called “Y” source (chapter 2) and sees no problem with attributing them both to Moses. John 7:19 Has not Moses given you the law?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A close relative of the documentary hypothesis is called the “Deutero-Isaiah theory.” This theory says that a single person did not write Isaiah. Chapters 1-39 are from one author, possibly the original Isaiah, while 40-66 were written after the fact, possibly by one or more of Isaiah’s disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John 12 we have two quotes from Isaiah, one from each of the two sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joh 12:37-41 Though he had done so many signs before them, they still did not believe in him, so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: “Lord, who has believed what he heard from us, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?” [Isaiah 53:1] Therefore they could not believe. For &lt;strong&gt;again Isaiah said&lt;/strong&gt;, “He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, lest they see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and turn, and I would heal them.” [Isaiah 6:10].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with Moses, the Holy Spirit authenticates Isaiah. John 12:40 could be interpreted as “that SAME Isaiah said again…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a similar theory that says Daniel didn’t really write Daniel. The prophecies are in such dramatic detail, that doubters have to conclude that all of Daniel was written after the fact. Again Jesus says in Mat 24:15, “…spoken of by Daniel the prophet….”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while the man says we should question Moses, Isaiah, and Daniel, Jesus authenticates the authorship of all three. It’s as if the Bible anticipated hostile jamming! As Chuck Missler said, “If you believe Jesus, you’ve got no problem with the authorship of Genesis. If you don’t believe in Jesus, you’ve got much bigger problems than the authorship of Genesis.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;then the LORD God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature. And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1Ti 2:13-14 For Adam was formed first, then Eve; [14] and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Co 15:45-48 Thus it is written, “The first man Adam became a living being”; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit. [46] But it is not the spiritual that is first but the natural, and then the spiritual. [47] The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven. [48] As was the man of dust, so also are those who are of the dust, and as is the man of heaven, so also are those who are of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to speaking into existence, God creates man by direct involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man&amp;rsquo;s physical and spiritual aspects are seen in the ground dust and God’s personal breath of life. Human life is a deliberate creation by God. This gives us purpose and dictates how we should treat ourselves and each other. Today’s world tells us we are just a cosmic accident and have no meaning. This worldview also dictates how they would have us should treat ourselves and each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster writes, “Our job is to cultivate the godly side of our nature and integrate it into the earthly side. Our job is to reveal heaven on earth.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Living creature” is an odd translation option by the ESV. The Hebrew word is “Nefesh,” which is most often rendered, soul. Denotatively it can refer to any living animal, though nephesh tends to be limited to mankind outside of the creation story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages read this as “a soul which can speak. Man, then, is elevated above all animals, for God has given him the ability to speak. However, this faculty elevates man only when he uses it for worthy purposes. Someone who misuses his speech by speaking against others is considered lower than a beast. A beast cannot destroy through talk, whereas man can slay with his tongue. (Chofetz Chayim)”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Adam was not deceived” is a staggering statement. That means Adam knew exactly what He was doing when he ate the fruit. Is this deliberate rebellion, or is something deeper possibly going on? We’ll look at that next lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;And out of the ground the LORD God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rev 2:7 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 22:14 Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life and that they may enter the city by the gates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eden means “delight” in Hebrew. In the Greek Septuagint, the translators selected the word for “paradise.” Adam had everything he could have wanted, including eventually a helper. The tree of life represents immortality; this is how Jesus references it in Revelation. Saying we will eat of the tree of life is to say we will have eternal life. The issue with the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil is that it includes a knowledge of death. We’ll continue this thought in verse 16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers. The name of the first is the Pishon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rev 22:1-2&lt;/sup&gt; Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Joh 7:38&lt;/sup&gt; Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, ‘Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we saw in the final chapters of Revelation, the Garden of Eden “corresponds to paradise, the Messianic Age, and the World to come. In the Messianic Era, a river will flow out of Eden again in the form of a might river that flows forth from the holy Temple and from Jerusalem.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The name of the second river is the Gihon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Cush. And the name of the third river is the Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably ever since the story of Genesis 2 was first told by Moses, people have wondered where exactly Eden was. Verse seven only tells us that it was in the east. The Tigris and Euphrates originate in the Armenian mountains (where Mt. Ararat happens to be), but post-flood, we are dealing with a very different terrain today than would have existed in the days of Adam. “Gihon” happens to be the name of the only freshwater spring in Jerusalem. From this are both Jewish and Muslim traditions that the “rock” that is presently enshrined by the Dome of the Rock is the foundation stone for the entire earth. Jewish tradition holds that the Temple represented Eden on earth, “the paradise where man can enter into God’s presence.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Walton speculates, “the characteristics of a well-watered garden in which humans do little or no work and in which life springs up without cultivation fits the marshy areas at the base of the (Persian) Gulf and may even be an area now covered by the waters of the region.”[^11][^13]
&lt;p&gt;In Revelation, the World to Come, the New Jerusalem will stand within the restored Garden of Eden, where a river will flow out of it and a tree of life will grow. Perhaps the Jerusalem connection is more than just tradition!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;גַן&lt;/span&gt;, the word translated “garden” does not typically refer to vegetable plots but to orchards or parks containing trees.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 2:16-17&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, “You may surely eat of every tree of the garden, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Deu 30:19&lt;/sup&gt; I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Therefore choose life, that you and your offspring may live,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man was not initially forbidden from eating from the Tree of Life. A part of being human, a part which God did not restrict in the Garden, is the ability to choose good or evil, life or death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discipleship precept: most every choice we make involves a decision to live for God or live for ourselves. In this respect, we are choosing between the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil several times a day. God desires that we choose the way of Life (see Deu 30:19), but He allows us to decide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 2:18-20&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Then the LORD God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.” Now out of the ground the LORD God had formed every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name. The man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper fit for him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the seven “goods” in chapter one, we now have a “not good” in chapter 2. Man’s loneliness, and perhaps by application after the fall, a man’s tendency to isolate from the community, is called “not good” by God. Selfishness and solitary independence are not in God’s will. “In embracing the “other” our capacity is extended to embrace our Father-God in a growing, every more intimate relationship.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you are specifically called by God to separate yourself for ministry (Matthew 19:12), a permanently single life should not be a desire. Sages see the text implying Adam was aware of his loneliness, particularly after naming what presumably were pairs of animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desire for love, affection, admiration, and community are more of what it means to be human (even though I think my dogs demonstrate these traits, if I didn’t feed them, they’d probably not be so affectionate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He brought them to the man to see what he would call them.” – God delights in man’s wonder and creativity. The naming of a thing was to declare dominion over it; this is why it is not to be overlooked when demons tell Jesus “We know who you are” and when Jesus asks for their names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 2:21-22&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. And the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Eph 2:19-22&lt;/sup&gt; So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, [20] built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, [21] in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord. [22] In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, God separates and forms Eve with His hands. It’s been said that to create Eve below the mid-section would imply Eve is inferior. To create Eve from above the heart would imply Adam is inferior. Instead, God chose to make Eve an equal. In removing a structure designed to protect the vital organs, man is also made vulnerable in marriage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word translated as “made” is actually the verb “built.” Lancaster believes Paul is directly referencing this Hebrew word in Genesis 2:22 in his passage in Ephesians 2 talking about the ecclesia being joined to her Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discipleship precept: “Adam’s state of unconsciousness at the time of the creation of Eve illustrates how a husband should relate to his wife. He should act as if he were asleep and overlook minor faults in order to avoid domestic quarrels.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Another sage said, “the true test of a person’s propensity toward anger is judged by his behavior in the circle of his own family, which will undoubtedly provide opportunities for anger.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a potential parallel here. The first Adam’s sleep corresponds to the second Adam’s death. Just as Even was made in Adam’s “absence”, so also was the Ecclesia made in Messiah’s absence. Just as the First Adam awoke to be united with his bride, Eve, Jesus will one day “awaken” to be reunited with His bride, the ecclesia. Paul builds on this symbolism in Ephesians 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Then the man said, “This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Eph 5:29-32&lt;/sup&gt; For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church, [30] because we are members of his body. [31] “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” [32] This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to &lt;strong&gt;Christ and the church.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2 Cor 5:17&lt;/sup&gt; Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bride of Adam is from the body of Adam. The Bride of Messiah is from the body of Messiah. Eve is a new creation. In Messiah, we are a new creation. 2 Cor 5:17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God uses the model of marriage to communicate His deepest truths. I can’t wait until we get to Genesis 24 and the marriage of Isaac and Rebekah. Typology is everywhere. Until then, just as we are called to leave the household of our youth and be joined with our husband or wife, Jesus calls us to leave or former lives of idolatry and sin behind and become joined with him as a pure, spotless bride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become &lt;strong&gt;one flesh.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mar 10:6-9/Mat 19:5 But from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’ [7] ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, [8] and the two shall become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two but one flesh. [9] What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Co 6:15-17 Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never! [16] Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, “The two will become one flesh.” [17] But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, one flesh is besar echad. This is where we get the idea of the word “echad” representing a compound unity. So in Deuteronomy 6:4, when we read, “The LORD is our God, the LORD is one (echad),” this need not exclude the Christian concept of a triune God. Those typically traditionally Jewish, see Christianity as worshipping three gods, but they are misunderstanding the trinity (to be fair, the trinity is a complex topic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besar echad is a uniquely human characteristic. Lower animals temporarily join for the purpose of procreation, but man is sanctified in marriage. Here are some writings collected by Pliskin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He should honor his wife more than himself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“(Each) should do as the other desires and refrain from doing whatever the other dislikes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If a husband will try to fulfill his obligations and the wife will try to fulfill her obligations, they will live a happy and tranquil life together. Troubles begin when the husband is only concerned that the wife meet her obligations to him, and the wife is only concerned that the husband meet his obligations to her.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attempts by society to cheapen and weaken the institution of marriage are nothing new. We will note many of the patriarchs and kings of Judah/Israel have multiple wives, but it’s important to note that God never sanctioned this, in the same way God permits divorce in Deuteronomy 24 but does not sanction it. In Mark 10, Jesus emphasizes that from the beginning a single, lifelong monogamous relationship was God’s original design and cites both Genesis 1:27 and 2:24 as His “proof texts.” Jesus apparently had no problem with the two “different” Creation stories in Genesis 1 and 2. What might be lost on modern readers, is that he is also applying the definition of adultery equally to men and women. In that day, fornication and adultery had two different definitions, which resulted in a married man being able to engage in a relationship with a single woman virtually without penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one example where less-informed Christians say “Jesus is overturning the Law.” He’s doing nothing of the sort. He’s restoring the definition to God’s original intent and citing the Torah as His basis for doing so. In so doing, Jesus leveled the playing field by placing husband and wife on equal footing and limits disciples of Jesus to a single wife. Interestingly, documentation from the Dead Sea Scrolls imposed similar definitions and prohibitions on their Qumran community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-225---naked-in-the-garden-of-pleasure-and-delight&#34;&gt;Gen 2:25 - Naked in the garden of pleasure and delight&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Heb 13:4 Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is God’s design for sexuality. It is not sinful, shameful, or perverse. It is a wicked world that makes it that way by presenting a skewed vision, if not an outright mockery of God’s original plan for a husband and wife to be one flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divorce and inappropriate relationships before and outside of marriage (physical or electronic) are damaging. If anyone reading is caught up in sexual sin, please seek wise Christian counsel. There is help and countless others have broken these chains of shame and immorality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fully used for God’s service we must be pure, undefiled, and unashamed. Just like Adam and Eve were in the “Garden of Pleasure and Delight”. The fact that this very phrase sounds “r-rated” and selacious to our ears signifies how much Satan and the world make a mockery of God’s design. We associate these things with Las Vegas, when we should be associating them with our marriages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew words for man and woman are &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;איש&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אשה&lt;/span&gt; (Ishah = woman, ish = man)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two unique letters are  &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;י&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ה&lt;/span&gt;, which spell &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;יה&lt;/span&gt;, Jah, the short-form of God’s holy name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you take God out of a marriage, the two remaining letters are &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;א&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ש&lt;/span&gt;, which spells &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אֵשׁ&lt;/span&gt;, or “fire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Akiva said, “when a marriage is godly and the marriage bed is kept pure, God is present with husband and wife. When a marriage is godless and the marriage bed is defiled, it is a consuming fire that will destroy both.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true for an unmarried “ish” or “Isha” who is using sex outside of the proper, God-designed context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no God, there is only destructive fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, when we have a God-honoring marriage, with God involved, we have a taste of what it was like in Eden.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Annunciations - Luke 1:1-80</title>
      <link>https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb1/gb02/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ANNUNCIATIONS, we visit the Holy Temple in Jerusalem to watch the priesthood conduct the morning sacrifice. We meet Zechariah and follow him into the Sanctuary for his encounter with the angel Gabriel. The story of Zechariah and Elizabeth and their struggle to conceive a child hearkens back to the patriarchs. The miraculous conception of John sets in motion a chain of events that will culminate in the messianic redemption. Then, six months later, the angel descends to appear before a simple Jewish girl in a rural Galilean village. Mary leaves Nazareth and travels to Ein Karem near Jerusalem to visit her cousin Elizabeth. The Holy Spirit stirs hearts and moves tongues to give utterance to the good news of redemption.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things that have been accomplished among us,just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word have delivered them to us, it seemed good to me also, having followed all things closely for some time past, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, that you may have certainty concerning the things you have been taught.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all one sentence in Greek as it is in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is considered some of the highest academic/classical Greek in all of antiquity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this introduction belies the letter&amp;rsquo;s importance to whoever Theophilus was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This style will change abruptly in verse 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/image1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Ephesus Luke&amp;#39;s tomb with bull tb010501537&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the Gospel writers is associated with one of the Four Living Creatures in Ezekiel 1 and Revelation 4 (Lion, Man, Ox, and Eagle)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are also the standards for the camp of Israel (Numbers 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, the assignment of each has not remained constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw John as the Eagle in the last lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally Luke was associated with an Ox; today Mark gets the Ox because Mark portrays Jesus as the Servant of all, while Luke gets the Man because his gospel portrays Jesus as the Son of Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo is of Luke&amp;rsquo;s tomb in Ephesus and, you can see the Ox or Bull underneath the cross&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most scholars pin the date of the book to the 80s or early 90s CE; however, the fact that Luke (and all of the Gospels) omit mention of the destruction of the Jewish Temple in 70 CE might suggest an earlier date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who was Theophilus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theo means God and Phileo means friendship love, so the name could mean &amp;ldquo;Lover of God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potentially it is a code name. People who followed the God of Israel (including Yeshua following Jews and Gentiles) weren&amp;rsquo;t especially popular in the second-half of the first-century. Revelation speaks in code to avoid Roman censors; it&amp;rsquo;s possible the letter is addressed to the &amp;ldquo;Lover of God&amp;rdquo; who would have been known in Luke&amp;rsquo;s circle but not widely known elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is typically thought that Luke&amp;rsquo;s gospel was commissioned to provide an authoritative Greek gospel for the growing number of believers in the Gentile world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster notes that Josephus, a Jewish but pro-Roman historian, mentions (and archeology confirms) a high-priest by the name of Theophilus in the Apostolic Era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler believes Theophilus was a wealthy benefactor in one of Paul&amp;rsquo;s congregations who commissioned Luke and Acts for Paul&amp;rsquo;s trial in Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be similar to a deposition or affidavit used in courts today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early date and formal first sentence would be consistent with such a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke notes that his gospel is not the only gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a trial lawyer, he reviewed other documents and interviewed witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke, who was a physician, was highly educated and credible; therefore, he could attest to the document&amp;rsquo;s authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke makes the point that his is an &amp;ldquo;orderly account.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many commentators take this to mean Luke&amp;rsquo;s is the most chronologically accurate of the four gospels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zechariah-and-elizaeth&#34;&gt;Zechariah and Elizaeth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abijah. And he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. And they were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord. But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:6 And he believed the LORD, and he counted it to him as righteousness.  &lt;p&gt; Genesis 17:17 Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed and said to himself, &amp;ldquo;Shall a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the style abruptly changes from the lofty Greek to a Hebraic, Old Testament-style narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the many themes in the Bible is that of the righteous but barren woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish sages wrote, &amp;ldquo;whenever it is written, &amp;lsquo;she had no child,&amp;rsquo; it means she would eventually bear one&amp;rdquo; (Genesis Rabbah 38:14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, being barren was thought of as a type of curse; but here, Luke is going out of his way to let us know they were both righteous before God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He even points out that Elizabeth was from the daughters of Aaron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something a normal reader would likely pass over, but for those who dig, there is a nugget here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Levite like Zechariah was free to marry from any tribe, but it was considered especially righteous to marry another Levite from Aaron&amp;rsquo;s line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Luke (or more specifically the Holy Spirit) underscoring how righteous Zechariah was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The childless was not a punishment for sin or because he was unworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that culture, Zechariah was also free to marry another who could have children; but he didn&amp;rsquo;t. He stayed with Elizabeth as they both advanced in years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any attempt to understand the political situation in Israel during the time of Jesus is going to be limited without a study of Herod the Great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Schlegel notes that Hollywood should make a movie because his life had all the elements Hollywood likes: war, violence, romance, sex, intrigue, assassinations, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one since Solomon controlled as much land in the region, and no one has since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His footprints are all over the Holy Land in terms of his many building projects, which the people liked because they give a sense of pride, and more immediately provided numerous jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These include the great palaces at Caesarea (labeled Strato&amp;rsquo;s Tower on this map), Jericho, Herodium by Bethlehem, and Masada, which has an incredible story as the last holdout for a band of rebels against Rome in AD72.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His most famous building was probably the Jewish Temple, which was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the old city walls are from the 16th century, the Western wall still contains a part of the Herodian wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, he was one of the most ruthless dictators who ever lived, so ultimately he was hated by the people he ruled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly suffering from some form of paranoia mixed with megalomania, he didn&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to eliminate anyone he saw as a threat including immediate family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a quip that it was safer to be a pig in Herod&amp;rsquo;s house than one of his sons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He killed his wife Mariamne and then later wailed because of her death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he was dying, he gave an order to have some very popular Jewish leaders and rabbis arrested and executed&amp;hellip;all because he insisted that there be mourning on the day he died. Fortunately, that order was not carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was in the midst of this darkness that God became directly involved in Man&amp;rsquo;s affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;8 Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty, according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense. And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1Ch 24:3,10 With the help of Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, David organized them according to the appointed duties in their service&amp;hellip;the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Negev and the WildernessTabernacle ModelTabernacle model incense altar, tb052208365.jpg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were as many as 18000 Levites who could serve as priests. This was likely a once-in-a-lifetime experience for Zechariah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His job was to kindle the incense and get it lit. The Jewish Mishnah records the day-to-day functions and service of the Temple. The photo is of the altar of incense as it may have looked like in the Tabernacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Zechariah was doing this inside the Holy Place, the people were gathered. In their view, Zechariah was lifting their prayers up to God inside as they were praying outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Daniel 6, we see Daniel kept the appointed times of prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did this even though at the time, Jerusalem was in ruins. He still opened his window and prayed towards Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zechariah was likely praying too when he was interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lukes-seven-oracles&#34;&gt;Luke&amp;rsquo;s Seven Oracles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annunciation of John to Zechariah - 1:13-17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annunciation of Jesus to Mary - 1:30:37&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blessings of Elizabeth - 1:42-45&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Magnificat&lt;/em&gt; - 1:46-55&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Benedictus&lt;/em&gt; - 1:68-80&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nunc Dimitis&lt;/em&gt; 2:29:32&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary&amp;rsquo;s Sword - 2:34-25&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 1-2 continues the conspicuous pattern of sevens in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most obvious is Revelation, where we have seven churches, seven bowls, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less obvious are the seven &amp;ldquo;I AM the &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; statements by Jesus in John&amp;rsquo;s gospel and the seven Kingdom parables in Matthew&amp;rsquo;s gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we exclude duplicates and letters written to pastors, we find that Paul also wrote to seven churches (Rome, Corinth, Galatia, Ephesus, Philippi, Colossae, and Thessaloniki).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep your eyes open for these as you study the Bible. Missler calls them &amp;ldquo;fingerprints of the Holy Spirit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every verse in these oracles (also called &amp;ldquo;canticles&amp;rdquo; in some church traditions) has at least one allusion to an Old Testament verse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not have two books, a superior New Testament that replaces an inferior Old Testament. We have a single collection of 66 books that are intricately woven and interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;But the angel said to him, &amp;ldquo;Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. &lt;p&gt; And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth, for he will be great before the Lord. And he must not drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother&amp;rsquo;s womb. And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God, and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Gen 21:6-7 And Sarah said, &amp;ldquo;God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh over me.&amp;rdquo; [7] And she said, &amp;ldquo;Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.&amp;rdquo; &lt;p&gt; Num 6:2-3 &amp;ldquo;Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When either a man or a woman makes a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself to the LORD, [3] he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink. He shall drink no vinegar made from wine or strong drink and shall not drink any juice of grapes or eat grapes, fresh or dried.&lt;p&gt; Jdg 13:7 but he said to me, &amp;lsquo;Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. So then drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; &lt;p&gt;   Mal 4:5-6 &amp;ldquo;Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes. [6] And he will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the land with a decree of utter destruction.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This annunciation echos the heavenly birth announcements found in Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many will rejoice &amp;ndash; not just the immediate circumstance at the news of Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s delivery, but also those who repent and follow Jesus because of John&amp;rsquo;s message will celebrate John&amp;rsquo;s birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No strong drink &amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called a Nazirite vow from Numbers 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul underwent a temporary Nazirite vow in Acts 18 (well after his Damascus Road experience, by the way. He REMAINED Jewish after his so-called &amp;ldquo;conversion.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judges 13:7 states that when a child is to be a Nazirite from birth, there are restrictions placed on the mother as well. Elizabeth observed the Nazirite constraints. The passage references Samson, the most famous (and flawed) Nazirite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-118-20-zechariah-doubts&#34;&gt;Luke 1:18-20 Zechariah Doubts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And Zechariah said to the angel, &amp;ldquo;How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.&amp;rdquo; And the angel answered him, &amp;ldquo;I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The punishment for Zechariah&amp;rsquo;s disbelief seems harsh given that Abraham, Gideon, and even Mary asked similar questions when they received supernatural visions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, his being unable to speak was the sign from Gabriel. Be careful what you wish for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabriel comes from gibor, strong, mighty, warrior, hero, and El, the short name of God. So Gabriel is &amp;ldquo;hero of God,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;mighty man of God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible mentions two angels by name (besides The Angel of the Lord, which is a manifestation of God himself (and by extension Jesus preincarnate, since Jesus is God)), Michael and Gabriel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish and Catholic tradition adds a few more, notably Raphael and Uriel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting speculation is that Zechariah was inside praying for a son, yet when that prayer was answered, he didn&amp;rsquo;t believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This contrasts with Abraham, Gideon, and Mary where the appearance was unsolicited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, he was doubting God&amp;rsquo;s ability to answer his prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How often are we like this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-121-23&#34;&gt;Luke 1:21-23&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in the temple. And when he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he kept making signs to them and remained mute. And when his time of service was ended, he went to his home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Zechariah was inside, another priest outside the holy place ascended the ramp and sacrificed a lamb, and placed it onto the altar fires for the morning offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The priest who lit the incense was to emerge, and raise his hands in the sign of the priesthood (the &amp;ldquo;Spock&amp;rdquo; Vulcan hand gesture, which Lenord Neimoy, an observant Jew, intentionally incorporated into the original Star Trek). He then would give the priestly benediction: &amp;ldquo;the LORD Bless you and keep you; the LORD lift up his countenance on you and grant you shalom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve got two immediate problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incense priest usually emerged immediately &amp;ndash; did Zechariah&amp;rsquo;s delay mean that the people&amp;rsquo;s prayers were not heard?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he did finally emerge, he was unable to give the benediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;rsquo;t told how, but the people finally realized he&amp;rsquo;d seen a vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-124-25&#34;&gt;Luke 1:24-25&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she kept herself hidden, saying, &amp;ldquo;Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference passage: Gen 30:23 She conceived and bore a son and said, &amp;ldquo;God has taken away my reproach.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;rsquo;t told exactly why she &amp;ldquo;kept herself hidden&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There might have been a custom of isolation during the early stages of pregnancy to guard against both natural and supernatural threats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-126-29-gabriel-visits-mary&#34;&gt;Luke 1:26-29 Gabriel visits Mary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, and he came to her and said, &amp;ldquo;Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!&amp;rdquo; But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hail Mary, full of grace&amp;rdquo; is scriptural&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nazareth is about 70 miles north of Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some scholars speculate that the entire town of 200 or so folks might all be from David&amp;rsquo;s line (as Joseph and Mary were) who relocated north at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was nothing notable about Nazareth (except perhaps in a negative sense as used in John 1:46); the major center was Sephorris, which is likely where Joseph and Jesus found carpentry and masonry work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-130-33-the-annunciation&#34;&gt;Luke 1:30-33 The Annunciation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30 And the angel said to her, &amp;ldquo;Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference verses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 7:14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im &amp;ndash; anu &amp;ndash; El = with us God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word &lt;em&gt;alma&lt;/em&gt; could mean &amp;ldquo;maiden&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;young woman,&amp;rdquo; and this is a point that many antagonists of Christianity will point out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Old Testament was translated into Greek a couple of centuries before Jesus was born. The Greek word &lt;em&gt;Parthenos&lt;/em&gt; used in Isaiah 7:4 is unmistakably a virgin as we think of the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the immediate context, this refers to King Ahaz&amp;rsquo;s son Hezekiah, but Christians see a double-fulfillment with Jesus. Often there is an immediate application and then a longer range application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virgin birth, along with the resurrection are targets for critics who just can&amp;rsquo;t accept the supernatural nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen 16:11 And the angel of the LORD said to her, &amp;ldquo;Behold, you are pregnant and shall bear a son. You shall call his name Ishmael, because the LORD has listened to your affliction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Sa 7:9,14 And I have been with you wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth&amp;hellip; I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 2:7 I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, &amp;ldquo;You are my Son; today I have begotten you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 132:11 The LORD swore to David a sure oath from which he will not turn back: &amp;ldquo;One of the sons of your body I will set on your throne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Sa 7:13 He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Sa 7:16 And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 9:7 Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protestants tend to distance themselves from the Catholic veneration of Mary, but let&amp;rsquo;s not forget Mary was the chosen woman to bear the messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She truly was blessed among all women, so we owe her due credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripture does not say that she herself was immaculately conceived, nor does it say that she remained a virgin after Jesus was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When discussing with people of different faith backgrounds, look for points of commonality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Catholics and Protestants would both agree that Mary is an incredible woman who was used by God, and the primary point of our focus should be on Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-134-38&#34;&gt;Luke 1:34-38&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And Mary said to the angel, &amp;ldquo;How will this be, since I am a virgin?&amp;rdquo; And the angel answered her, &amp;ldquo;The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy&amp;mdash;the Son of God. And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. For nothing will be impossible with God.&amp;rdquo; And Mary said, &amp;ldquo;Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.&amp;rdquo; And the angel departed from her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing about the Annunciation indicated that the conception would be supernatural, but perhaps Mary suspected or even physically felt something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking, Mary was a barren woman just like Sarah and Elizabeth; she just was not advanced in age. Let us not overlook the fact that God, once again, supernaturally opens a closed womb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wonder if, at her young age, she truly realized she was about to become a social outcast and the subject of vicious small-town gossip for supposed illegitimate pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we get to the &amp;ldquo;Genealogies&amp;rdquo; we&amp;rsquo;re going to study a guy by the name of Jeconiah in Jeremiah 22 and why the virgin birth may be particularly relevant to Jesus being of the &amp;ldquo;house and lineage of David.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Gideon and Zechariah, Mary does not ask for a sign. She just asks, how can these things be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is given one anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her aged and heretofore barren relative Elizabeth has also conceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her faithfulness here echos that of Ruth who places herself at the mercy of Naomi and then Boaz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we truly believe that &amp;ldquo;nothing is impossible with God&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-139-41&#34;&gt;Luke 1:39-41&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a town in Judah, and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke does not give a specific location for the home of Elizabeth and Zechariah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literary tradition from the 6th century identifies Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s hometown with Ein Kerem (about 6 miles west of Jerusalem) and the presence of two 4th-century churches indicates that the tradition is even older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Ein Kerem has a population of about 2000; it is essentially a suburb of Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-142-45-elizabeths-blessing&#34;&gt;Luke 1:42-45 Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s Blessing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and she exclaimed with a loud cry, &amp;ldquo;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-146-55----the-magnificat&#34;&gt;Luke 1:46-55 &amp;ndash; The &lt;em&gt;Magnificat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most beautiful expressions of glory and gratitude; it is very Psalm=like. The Holy Spirit was definitely present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The praise is similar to Hannah&amp;rsquo;s song in 1 Samuel 2 and has many allusions and themes from the Hebrew Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It begins with her personal praise and expands to the hope and promise of the Messianic redemption (the redemption that has its fulfillment in Revelation 19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;46 And Mary said, &amp;ldquo;My soul magnifies the Lord,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Sam 2:1 And Hannah prayed and said, &amp;ldquo;My heart exults in the LORD; my horn is exalted in the LORD. My mouth derides my enemies, because I rejoice in your salvation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;47 and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hab 3:18 yet I will rejoice in the LORD; I will take joy in the God of my salvation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word for salvation here is [יִשְׁעִֽי]{dir=&amp;ldquo;rtl&amp;rdquo;} &amp;ndash; Yesuha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;48 for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant. For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Sam 1:11 &amp;hellip;remember me and not forget your maidservant&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen 29:32 And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben, for she said, &amp;ldquo;Because the LORD has looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will love me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen 30:13 And Leah said, &amp;ldquo;Happy am I! For women have called me happy.&amp;rdquo; So she called his name Asher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;49 for he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psa 126:3 The LORD has done great things for us; we are glad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;50 And his mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psa 103:17 But the steadfast love of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, and his righteousness to children&amp;rsquo;s children,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;51 He has shown strength with his arm; He has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 136:12 with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, for his steadfast love endures forever;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 89:13 You have a mighty arm; strong is your hand, high your right hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 89:10 &amp;hellip;you scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;52 He has brought down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of humble estate;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Sa 2:7 The LORD makes poor and makes rich; He brings low and he exalts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 113:7 He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;53 He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He has sent away empty.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 107:9 For he satisfies the longing soul, and the hungry soul he fills with good things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Sa 2:5 Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, but those who were hungry have ceased to hunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;54 He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of His mercy,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 41:8 But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, the offspring of Abraham, my friend&amp;hellip;Fear not&amp;hellip; you men of Israel! I am the one who helps you, declares the LORD; your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 98:3 He has remembered his steadfast love and faithfulness to the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;55 as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his offspring forever.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exo 32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, &amp;lsquo;I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have promised I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit it forever.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mic 7:20 You will show faithfulness to Jacob and steadfast love to Abraham, as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will you notice God is not done with Israel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passages like this also demonstrate the interconnection between the Old and the New Testament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-156-58&#34;&gt;Luke 1:56-58&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And Mary remained with her about three months and returned to her home. Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son. And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child. And they would have called him Zechariah after his father,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:12 He who is eight days old among you shall be circumcised. Every male throughout your generations, whether born in your house or bought with your money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lev 12:3 And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-160-66-his-name-is-yochanon&#34;&gt;Luke 1:60-66 His name is Yochanon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;but his mother answered, &amp;ldquo;No; he shall be called John.&amp;rdquo; And they said to her, &amp;ldquo;None of your relatives is called by this name.&amp;rdquo; And they made signs to his father, inquiring what he wanted him to be called. And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, &amp;ldquo;His name is John.&amp;rdquo; And they all wondered. And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God. And fear came on all their neighbors. And all these things were talked about through all the hill country of Judea, and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, &amp;ldquo;What then will this child be?&amp;rdquo; For the hand of the Lord was with him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-167&#34;&gt;Luke 1:67&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-168-79-the-benedictus&#34;&gt;Luke 1:68-79 The &lt;em&gt;Benedictus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;68 &amp;ldquo;Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has visited and redeemed his people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 41:13 Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! Amen and Amen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 111:9 He sent redemption to his people; he has commanded his covenant forever. Holy and awesome is his name!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;69 and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Sa 2:10 he will give strength to his king and exalt the horn of his anointed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 132:17 There I will make a horn to sprout for David; I have prepared a lamp for my anointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;70 as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zec 7:7 Were not these the words that the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous, with her cities around her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited?&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;71 that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2Sa 22:18 He rescued me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;72-73 to show the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant, the oath that he swore to our father Abraham, to grant us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exo 32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, &amp;lsquo;I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have promised I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit it forever.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lev 26:42 then I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and I will remember my covenant with Isaac and my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;74-75 that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, might serve him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2Ki 17:39 but you shall fear the LORD your God, and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;76 And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 40:3 A voice cries: &amp;ldquo;In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mal 3:1 &amp;ldquo;Behold, I send my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me. And the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant in whom you delight, behold, he is coming, says the LORD of hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;77 to give knowledge of salvation to his people in the forgiveness of their sins,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isa 53:11 Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied; by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous, and he shall bear their iniquities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;78 because of the tender mercy of our God, whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mal 4:2 But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness shall rise with healing in its wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 60:2 For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the peoples; but the LORD will arise upon you, and his glory will be seen upon you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;79 to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 9:2 The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 42:6-7 &amp;ldquo;I am the LORD; I have called you in righteousness; I will take you by the hand and keep you; I will give you as a covenant for the people, a light for the nations, to open the eyes that are blind, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, from the prison those who sit in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro 3:17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-180&#34;&gt;Luke 1:80&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;80 And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt;
At the end of chapter two, Adam and Eve are placed in the Garden of Eden and commanded not to eat from the “Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.” The serpent persuades Eve to violate the command, and she shares the forbidden fruit with her husband. Because of their sin, it is decreed that man will experience death, returning to the soil from which he was formed and that all gain will come only through struggle and hardship. Man is banished from the Garden.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-31-5-the-serpent-casts-doubt-on-the-word-of-god&#34;&gt;Genesis 3:1-5 The Serpent casts doubt on the Word of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col style=&#34;width: 50%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&#34;width: 50%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 3:1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God actually say, ‘You shall not eat of any tree in the garden’?”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rev 20:2 &lt;/sup&gt;And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2 Cor 11:3&lt;/sup&gt; But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Eze 28:13-15&lt;/sup&gt; You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering, sardius, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, emerald, and carbuncle; and crafted in gold were your settings and your engravings. On the day that you were created they were prepared. [14] You were an anointed guardian cherub. I placed you; you were on the holy mountain of God; in the midst of the stones of fire you walked. [15] You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created, till unrighteousness was found in you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:65%;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK a talking snake is a bit unusual. According to Jewish legend, Lucifer was enraged at God’s decision to create man, whom Lucifer no doubt viewed as a threat to his own status (and still does) he departed from God’s council and inhabited the snake. The serpent may in fact be the first case of demon possession in Scripture. We aren’t told much about the fall of Satan/Lucifer. In fact Heiser asserts that the Satan of Job chapter 1 and the serpent here were not originally the same being. The Satan, which means accuser, appeared to be serving the role of a court-appointed prosecutor, a role that apparently did exactly what God wanted him to do. The word Satan never appears in the Torah. In fact, it’s only in 11 verses in Job, two verses in Zechariah and one verse in 1 Chronicles. The word “devil” never appears in the Hebrew Bible. Later in Jewish history, the serpent of Eden, the devil, and the Satan of Job become co-mingled. After Genesis 3, the word serpent is typically only used to mean a snake, not a supernatural fallen angel By the time of Revelation at the end of the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century, the serpent, the devil, and the satan are all the same entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 14 and Ezekiel 28 are the two chapters that give us some biography of Satan, with Ezekiel 28:13 stating he was in Eden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler says there are two basic errors we make regarding Satan (and Lancaster reports that throughout history, Judaism makes the same two errors):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretend he doesn’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view holds that the devil is merely an abstraction or a symbol of man’s evil inclination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, &amp;ldquo;he&amp;rdquo; authors evil and seizes upon every evil opportunity.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was real in the life of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live in fear of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who do this are paralized and see the devil as behind &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; that is not right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Jn 4:4 Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The serpent uses the same basic approach as advertisers do today. FOMO. Fear of missing out. From the Wikipedia entry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear of missing out&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;FOMO&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The feeling of apprehension that one is either not in the know or missing out on information, events, experiences, or life decisions that could make one&amp;rsquo;s life better.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOMO is also associated with a fear of regret which may lead to concerns that one might miss an opportunity for social interaction, a novel experience, a memorable event, or a profitable investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is characterized by a desire to stay continually connected with what others are doing, and can be described as the fear that deciding not to participate is the wrong choice.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the FOMO was the chance to be like God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but God said, ‘You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rev 22:18-19&lt;/sup&gt; I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, [19] and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note Eve’s name is not mentioned here, which reminds me of Matthew’s genealogy where Bathsheba is referred to only as “the wife of Uriah.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/eve-touch.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commentators have chastised her for adding to the word of God here. We do not have it recorded that God didn’t command them to touch it. Adding to God’s word is something cults do and it leads to theological danger. When we add to God’s word, we give Satan an opportunity to twist and manipulate Scripture. All that is true and we should never say that God said something He never said. If this is truly what she did, she’s wrong. With that said, my thought here is with respect to Eve, this is much ado about nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judaism is known for putting fences or hedges around prohibited activities, and our churches do the same thing by the way. I’ve mentioned the fact that the Bible does not prohibit drinking alcohol; the Bible prohibits being drunk from alcohol. Many churches add a hedge that prohibits its members, or at a minimum, its leadership from drinking alcohol. Why? If you don’t drink alcohol, then you won’t get drunk. I’m not saying it’s necessarily a bad rule in many situations, but we need to realize it’s man’s rule, not God’s. Churches that do this are just as guilty of “adding to God’s word” as Eve is here. In the same way, if the rule is not to eat the forbidden fruit, then it seems like a wise plan not to touch it. If you don’t touch it, you probably won’t be in any danger of eating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, Adam and Eve walked with God and therefore they had many conversations that weren’t recorded. We don’t know with absolute certainty that God did NOT in fact say, “neither shall you touch it”; however, it was not accurate to say hyper-literally that merely touching the fruit would directly result in death. To be sure, touching it indirectly led to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume Eve was being reasonably factual here and move on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 3:4-5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;But the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;John 8:44&lt;/sup&gt; You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing good from evil sounds like the mark of wisdom. Why would God not want His creation to be able to differentiate? Further, why would God put something he didn’t want His people to do in the Garden? Isn’t that entrapment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often think of “evil” as a state; so in our view, what’s the problem of knowing about something as long as you don’t partake? Hebraic thought is much more action oriented. So, in Hebrew, evil means bad things happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a tragedy, we frequently hear, “how can a good God let this happen?” This is a difficult question and, when one is going through a trial, it seems to be reasonable to ask. Many have asked a similar question here. Why would God place the serpent and the tree in the Garden knowing they would fail. The answer is simple. To be human means we have to make choices. “It was important to God that human beings be free creatures with real choices&amp;hellip;If God had created a world where evil was not possible, it would also preclude the possibility of good.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John 8, we might say the religious rulers brought a knife to a gun fight. They made a not-so-subtle jab at Jesus’ presumed illegitimate father in verse 39. “Where is your father?” Jesus turns around and tells them who THEIR father is! John 8 has the tensest, most combative exchange in the Gospels. Those of us who secretely have a mischevious side, tend to love John 8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-36-13-man-and-woman-disobey-the-word-of-god&#34;&gt;Genesis 3:6-13 Man and woman disobey the Word of God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1Co 10:13-14&lt;/sup&gt; No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it. Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1 Tim 2:14&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Ex 32:31-32&lt;/sup&gt; So Moses returned to the LORD and said, “Alas, this people has sinned a great sin. They have made for themselves gods of gold. But now, if you will forgive their sin—but if not, please blot me out of your book that you have written.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Joh 15:13&lt;/sup&gt; Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are told that because of FOMO, the woman ate it and gave it to the man to eat. We are not told what kind of fruit it was. Jewish tradition holds that it was a fig (likely because of the next verse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see a theme that will be repeated in the Bible, most notoriously of David’s sin with Bathsheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not where we’re supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see something pleasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We desire it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We touch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We partake in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can summarise this by saying 1) Doubt God’s Word (Did God really say?); 2) Deny God’s word (God never said that!); 3) Rationalize our behavior (see? We’re not dead and it was pleasant).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 10:13 reminds us that each choice has a way out. It’s as if God puts stop signs that we blow right through. Just because you see doesn’t mean you have to covet. Just because you covet doesn’t mean you have to touch. Just because you touch doesn’t mean you have to take, and so on. There may not be any immediate negative reaction either. Eve initially said that if she touched it she would die. That didn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;adam-knew-what-he-was-doing&#34;&gt;Adam knew what he was doing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we noted last lesson, Paul makes it very clear that Eve was deceived but Adam was not. While this passage is often used to browbeat Eve, I think something else is going on. If Adam wasn’t deceived, that means he intentionally and deliberately ate the forbidden fruit. He knew EXACTLY what he was doing. Perhaps he didn’t appreciate all of the ramifications, but he knew the general consequence for disobedience (“you shall surely die”) yet did it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Was this deliberate rebellion? Missler says no; in fact Adam was modeling Jesus. He paints a great visual of what it might have been like in that moment where Eve had sinned and Adam hadn’t yet. “Wow, kid. You really messed up. You’re going to get it when dad finds out. I’m still ok. I haven’t done anything wrong, but you. Wow. I’ll be sure to pray for you.” That’s how WE would probably respond, but that’s not how Adam responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He knew what he was doing and what the consequences would be. Try this theory on for size: Adam willingly laid his life down to join Eve in her predicament rather than let Eve languish alone for eternity. This is something Moses offered to do after the Golden Calf incident. In Exodus 32:32, Moses says “blot me out of your book of life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, had Adam not joined Eve, there would have been no Messiah and thus no means of salvation for Eve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is a picture of Jesus, the sinless second Adam who laid down his life for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;firstsecond-adam-comparison&#34;&gt;First/Second Adam Comparison&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul draws several comparisons between Adam and Jesus the second Adam. It is helpful to view these side-by-side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;

&lt;th&gt;First Adam&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Romans 5:15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Many died through one man&amp;rsquo;s trespass&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Romans 5:16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The judgment following one trespass brought condemnation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The free gift following many trespasses brought justification&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Romans 5:17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Because of one man&amp;rsquo;s trespass, death reigned through that one man&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Much more those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness will reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Romans 5:18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;One trespass led to condemnation for all men&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;One act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Romans 5:19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;by the one man&amp;rsquo;s disobedience the many were made sinners&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;by the one man&amp;rsquo;s obedience the many will be made righteous&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 Corinthians 15:21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;by a man came death&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 Corinthians 15:22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;in Adam all die&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;in Christ shall all be made alive&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 Corinthians 15:45&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The first man Adam became a living being&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;the last Adam became a life-giving spirit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 Corinthians 15:46&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The spiritual is not first, but the natural&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Then the spiritual&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 Corinthians 15:47&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The first man is from the earth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The second man is from heaven&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 Corinthians 15:48&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;As is the earthly, so also are those who are earthly&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And as is the heavenly, so also are those who are heavenly&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 Corinthians 15:49&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Just as we have born the image of the earthly&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;We will also bear the image of the heavenly&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking in His Dust – At Genesis 3:6, Pliskin draws a seemingly odd conclusion about how we should put “love your neighbor” into practice. We may never be in a position to lay down our lives for our friends, but Pliskin writes of a much more immediate and practical application, “we should look for opportunities to save others from embarrassment.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In a sense, this is what Adam did. He didn’t let her suffer alone. Pliskin includes a few anecdotes from Jewish writings but here is a simple one. At Passover, a guest accidentally spilled some wine onto the tablecloth. Noticing his guest&amp;rsquo;s embarrassment, the host discreetly shook the table so that his cup of wine also tumbled over. “Something must be wrong with the table. It’s not standing properly.” At times, this may mean sacrificing a bit of our dignity to cover for another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 3:7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The serpent did not lie about their eyes being opened; like a slick salesman, he sold them on the benefits while glossing over the risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/figtree.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s very interesting that we don’t usually associate the fall with anything sexual, but apparently, their formerly pure sexual identity was the first thing they lost. It is not always polite to discuss but to be human is to be uniquely sexual. When we realize this, it is no wonder why Satan’s biggest attacks throughout history and to this very day seem to be related to sex. The human sex drive was twisted into something even from the very start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sewing the fig leaves (ouch) has been described as the first act of religion in the Bible. Mr. and Mrs. Man’s attempt to cover their sin by their own efforts. By the end of the chapter, God will show us His way of covering sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 3:8-9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden. But the LORD God called to the man and said to him, “Where are you?”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Jewish tradition holds that they weren’t actually nude as we think of it but Adam and Even were clothed with light, in other words not merely a physical but a spiritual garment. This allowed Adam and Eve to communicate directly with God. After the Fall, they lost this spiritual garment and were no longer able to speak as they once did. This even affected they way they heard God’s voice. Instead of directly, Adam now heard God’s voice only indirectly. Instead of pleasing, it was now terrifying. He could only hide in fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we’re feeling distant from God, we’re the ones who moved. God is seeking us out. A shepherd always seeks the sheep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Does God really see everything I do?” “God loves you so much He can’t take His eyes off you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be said of every other religion that it is man’s search for God. In contrast, the Judeo-Christian faith is about “God’s search for man.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 3:10-11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And he said, “I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.” He said, “Who told you that you were naked?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1 Co 6:15&lt;/sup&gt; Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, note the sexual connotation in this passage. We think of sinning against God as something spiritual, which of course it is. But it’s not JUST spiritual. To separate the physical from the spiritual as is common in Christianity today may be another attack from the enemy. Spirit good, flesh bad goes back to Gnostic heresy in the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; centuries. The lessons from scripture is the opposite of this: how we use our physical bodies directly affects our relationship and fellowship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 3:11-13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?” The man said, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate.” Then the LORD God said to the woman, “What is this that you have done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much is made of Adam’s passing the buck here. The common interpretation goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“when God confronted Adam on his sin, he refused to take accountability and instead attempted to shift the blame to Eve. Adam even takes a parting shot at God by implying that God is somehow responsible for Adam’s predicament. In Adam’s mind, if there had been no woman there would have been no sin, so it’s not his fault. Similarly, Eve refuses to own what she has done and attempts to shift blame to the Serpent. Of course, God sees right through their games and would have none of this. He then has to set the record straight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are true to scripture, which should ALWAYS be our goal, the biblical text supports virtually none of these assertions made by modern commentators. I’m not saying the application of taking accountability is not valid. 1 John 1 8-9 are words to live by for disciples of Jesus &amp;lt;read&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m only saying the Bible is silent with respect to this question of whether or not Adam and Eve “passed the buck”. The traditional protestant interpretation puts words in God’s mouth and we need to be very cautious about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you notice, God doesn’t challenge Adam’s assertion. On the surface, it is a factual statement, including the part about the “woman You gave me.” He doesn’t challenge Eve’s assertion either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, we read into the biblical text how WE would respond if we were in the same situation. Then we assume that’s how the characters in the narrative must also have responded. Parents are all too familiar with the “blame games” played by their kids. This is a source of constant frustration for parents; therefore, we presume God must have felt exasperated just as way we do when our kids play the blame game. So a theology is born about how Adam skirted his responsibility and blamed someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now of course, on a deeper application level, we need to own our sin and not blame someone else or blame God (or even blame the enemy) for what we did. “The devil made me do it” is a cop out. The devil may have showed you something appealing, but you are the one who “did it.” (whatever “it” happens to be). Eve’s response is actually quite good here. I was lied to, but ultimately I’m the one who ate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also often taught that Adam was not where he should have been, which was protecting his wife. While this is also not an incorrect application for us, let’s be clear we are reading that into the text. The text doesn’t say where Adam was and it doesn’t chastise him for not being where He was supposed to be. We are adding that in. Again, I’m not saying that is necessarily an incorrect assumption; but it is an assumption nonetheless. We need to be careful when we assume as the saying goes. For all we know, Adam in his still unfallen state, was walking with God at the time, which means he was exactly where he should have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;The LORD God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field; on your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life. I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1 John 3:8&lt;/sup&gt; Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gal 4:4&lt;/sup&gt; But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Luke 10:19&lt;/sup&gt; Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall hurt you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s declaration of war on Satan. This is a messianic prophecy and even hints of the Virgin birth. Biologically, the “seed” is always in the male.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler calls this the “seed plot of the Bible.” From here until Jesus, the messianic line will be under constant attack starting with Cain and Abel (actually it started with Adam and Eve) and continuing to the Cross and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;To the woman he said, “I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children. Your desire shall be contrary to your husband, but he shall rule over you.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;John 16:20&lt;/sup&gt; Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Romans 8:21-22&lt;/sup&gt; that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. &lt;sup&gt;22 &lt;/sup&gt;For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original intent was for Man and woman to be helpers and partners. Like officers in a company where the members have different roles but both answer to the head, which is God in this case. After the fall the relationship strained, and we certainly see the fruits of this in our society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God frequently uses the model of childbirth to describe the present, sinful age. There will be birth pains and travail as with labor, but then just as when the child is born, in the age to come all of that will give way to joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;And to Adam he said, “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, ‘You shall not eat of it,’ cursed is the ground because of you; in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life; thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rev 22:3&lt;/sup&gt; No longer will there be anything accursed, but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rev 21:4&lt;/sup&gt; He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1 Cor 15:21, 47&lt;/sup&gt; For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins and clothed them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mat 25:36, 38, 40&lt;/sup&gt; I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.’ … And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? … And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always look for what seems like it should be said but isn’t. On a surface level, God apparently slaughtered an animal, but that’s not what it says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish sacrificial system sounds so antiquated and foreign to those of us who purchase our meat neatly prepared and wrapped in cellophane, but it has its roots right here. This is a hint that blood is required for sin. Without the shedding of blood, there can be no remission of sins. An innocent must die. It’s all here and it’s all because of sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking in His Dust – a very practical way to love our neighbor is modeled by God in verse 21 and also by Jesus in Matthew 21. We are obligated to provide clothes for the needy.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Just as God clothed the naked Adam and Eve. And if God made them, we can be sure this was the finest leather, not cheap polyester! Thus, there is also the secondary lesson that we should attempt to have the clothing we give away be of the finest quality; however, it is better to attempt to give old clothes to a needy person before we throw them in the trash. A poor person would prefer used clothes to none at all. As with the LYN reference above, we should take great care not to embarrass the recipient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Pliskin draws a second lesson from the same passage, “we must be aware of the greatness of lovingkindness.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He then draws an interesting contrast between lovingkindness and charity. “The sages taught that loving-kindness in all its forms is greater than charity.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He then gives some examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Charity is performed only with money, whereas lovingkindness can be performed both bodily and monetarily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As it is written, “God MADE them coats of skin”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Charity applies only to the poor, whereas lovingkindness applies to everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For it is written “He made for ADAM coats of skin”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam had all the riches of the world at his disposal including the ability to slay his own animal and make his own coat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, God chose to bless him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several instances in the gospels where Jesus will appear to violate the Jewish law, but when we peel back the layers, we see what he is really doing is performing an act of loving kindness when such an act takes priority over the law. I’ve given the example before of how it’s ok to travel at twice the posted speed limit, provided you have lights, sirens, and the word “ambulance” written on your vehicle. The first-responders are performing an act of lovingkindness and trying to save a life, which is more important than the policy dictating how fast one may drive under normal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever—”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see God as a cosmic killjoy who is only interested in taking your pleasure? Adam and Eve could have seen it that way. It might be easy to read and think “why doesn’t God want them to live forever?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col style=&#34;width: 50%&#34; /&gt;

&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 3:24&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rev 22:2&lt;/sup&gt; through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Joh 7:38&lt;/sup&gt; Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, ‘Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to look at this. Both are probably fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had eternal life symbolized by the tree of life but lost it when they sinned – therefore the cherub blocking the way is a punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had not yet eaten of the tree of life (which is implied by verse 22), which is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they had eaten, they would essentially have been condemned to live for all eternity in their fallen state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God doesn’t want them to eat and live permanently, eternally in their fallen state, thus the cherub blocking the way back is an act of mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, this is the first and quite possibly the most significant act of mercy recorded in the Bible prior to the Cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gravitate towards the second view. Being eternally unredeemed and unredeemable is Satan’s status. It makes sense that he wants nothing more than to entice as many humans as he can to join him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exile from the Garden also foreshadows Israel’s exile from Israel on two occasions and looks forward to the regathering in the Messianic kingdom, which will usher in the new Eden (Revelation 19-22). Jesus is “the way” (and the truth and the life) back to the restored Eden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition is very interesting at this point. One source records that Adam and Eve repented of their sin and baptized themselves in one of the rivers that flowed out of the garden (Gen 2:10). This is mind blowing as “all four Gospels open with John the Immerser calling Israel to repentance and confession of sin, symbolized through immersion in a river.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Christian tradition we generally have only one immersion but this is not the case in Judaism. Today, as it was in the time of Jesus, Jews underwent ritual cleansing in what is called a Mikveh. We aren’t told, but it is probably that Jesus underwent several ritual immersions in addition to the main baptism in the Jordan by John. Lancaster writes, “when a person immerses in the waters of the Mikvah, he is also re-establishing a link with man’s perfected state in Eden. He then loses the status of uncleanness, and is reborn into a state of purity, where he is permitted to enter the Holy Temple.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; That sounds very similar to how Christians view baptism. Lancaster concludes, “the cure for Adam’s sin can only be obtained by an immersion of repentence in to the death and resurrection of Messiah – the Living Water that flows from the River of Life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;This is the revelation which God gave to Yeshua the Messiah, so that he could show his servants what must happen very soon. He communicated it by sending his angel to his servant Yochanan, 2. who bore witness to the Word of God and to the testimony of Yeshua the Messiah, as much as he saw. 3. Blessed are the reader and hearers of the words of this prophecy, provided they obey the things written in it! For the time is near! 4. From: Yochanan To: The seven Messianic communities in the province of Asia: Grace and shalom to you from the One who is, who was and who is coming; from the sevenfold Spirit before his throne; 5. and from Yeshua the Messiah, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead and the ruler of the earth&amp;rsquo;s kings. To him, the one who loves us, who has freed us from our sins at the cost of his blood, 6. who has caused us to be a kingdom, that is, cohanim for God, his Father—to him be the glory and the rulership forever and ever. Amen. 7. Look! He is coming with the clouds! Every eye will see him, including those who pierced him; and all the tribes of the Land will mourn him. Yes! Amen! 8. &amp;ldquo;I am the &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;Z,&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; says Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, the One who is, who was and who is coming. 9. I, Yochanan, am a brother of yours and a fellow-sharer in the suffering, kingship and perseverance that come from being united with Yeshua. I had been exiled to the island called Patmos for having proclaimed the message of God and borne witness to Yeshua. 10. I came to be, in the Spirit, on the Day of the Lord; and I heard behind me a loud voice, like a trumpet, 11. saying, &amp;ldquo;Write down what you see on a scroll, and send it to the seven Messianic communities—Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Allusions and Cross-References&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
We believe your study of this amazing book will be greatly enhanced if you read and meditate on the allusions listed. A comprehensive listing for all 22 chapters, including cross-references from the Treasury of Scripture Knowledge, is in Appendix A1.
&lt;p&gt;As you hover over (or tap) on each verse, the text of the English Standard Version will appear.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;this-is-the-revelation&#34;&gt;This is the Revelation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have several questions answered immediately in verse 1.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who wrote: John&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is it for: servants of Yeshua (not for unbelievers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is it about: Yeshua&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When should we study: immediately for the time is near&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we noted in the introduction, this is &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; revelation, so the book&amp;rsquo;s name is Revelation, not &amp;ldquo;revelations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John&amp;rsquo;s Hebrew name, Yochanan, means something like &amp;ldquo;blessed by God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although the original record we have is in Greek and John was multilingual, Jesus very likely communicated this in Hebrew, John&amp;rsquo;s primary language.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, Hebrew words for &amp;ldquo;revelation&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;exile&amp;rdquo; are linguistically related.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;גָלָה is the verb for &amp;ldquo;to reveal, uncover&amp;rdquo; and is pronounced &amp;ldquo;ga-LAH&amp;rdquo;; גָלוּת, &amp;ldquo;ga-LOOT,&amp;rdquo; is the word for exile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewish apocryphal writings, of which Revelation is included, tend to occur when the people were exiled by God, living outside the land when they were vulnerable to abuses by the pagan nations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we mentioned in the introduction, one of the purposes of Jewish apocalyptic literature was for God to communicate to His people that He is still in control. Although things seem unfair now, a day is coming when God will set everything straight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To help capture the &amp;ldquo;Jewishness&amp;rdquo; of the book, we will be using the Complete Jewish Bible (CJB) paraphrase translation.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No translation is perfect, and the CJB is not without problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can hover over any Bible reference and compare the English Standard Version (ESV). Often the King James Version does the best job at capturing the meaning of the Greek.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;godyeshuaangelyochanan&#34;&gt;God/Yeshua/Angel/Yochanan&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that we receive Revelation, &amp;ldquo;4th hand.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God gave it to Jesus, who gave it to an angel/messenger, who gave it to John, who wrote it down and communicated to the servants of Messiah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John is not receiving all of this directly from Jesus but through an angel who bears witness to Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the end of the chapter, we will be practically unable to distinguish who is speaking, even though we know from verse 1 that it must be the angel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This concept is very similar to the &amp;ldquo;Angel of the LORD&amp;rdquo; that we see in the Old Testament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We often presume this angel is a pre-incarnate version of Jesus, but it may not be that simple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There appears to be an &amp;ldquo;Angel of the Messiah,&amp;rdquo; just like an &amp;ldquo;Angel of the LORD.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This angel has the full authority to speak to John, just as if it were Jesus Himself speaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lizorkin and Shir discuss the challenges of figuring out who is speaking in Revelation:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;As in any complex composition, such a rich polyphony of heavenly sound will demand careful and attentive listening to clearly distinguish between the voices and appreciate both their choir-like message and the voice of the individual performers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chapter one reveals that John&amp;rsquo;s concept of the &amp;ldquo;Trinity&amp;rdquo; may not be fully in keeping with the traditional Protestant view
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protestants see the Trinity as three co-equal persons. Still, throughout Revelation and even in the Gospel of John, Jesus is subordinate to the Father.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In verse 1, we see that Jesus had to learn about Revelation from the Father.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the doctrine of the Trinity is undoubtedly biblical, we must remember it is a man-made concept – the word &amp;ldquo;trinity&amp;rdquo; never appears in the Bible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We would be wise to loosely hold any man-made ideas (including views on Eschatology) as we work through Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let the Spirit pour into us as we check everything out against Scripture!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;servants&#34;&gt;Servants&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Greek word for servants is &lt;em&gt;doulos&lt;/em&gt; which we can translate as &amp;ldquo;bondservants.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bondservant is one who freely and willingly attaches himself to the household of his master, &amp;ldquo;because he loves you and your household since he is well-off with you.&amp;rdquo; (Deut 15:16-17)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As talmidim of Jesus, we are called to be His bondservants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This book is for us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we go through the book, we will highlight some of the patterns of seven that may not be obvious. The callout box below lists the seven instances of &amp;ldquo;Messiah&amp;rdquo; in Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Seven Messiah verses in Revelation&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;ldquo;Messiah&amp;rdquo; (Christ) appears seven times, starting with 1:1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the revelation which God gave to Yeshua the &lt;strong&gt;Messiah&lt;/strong&gt;, so that he could show his servants what must happen very soon. He communicated it by sending his angel to his servant Yochanan (Rev 1:1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who bore witness to the Word of God and to the testimony of Yeshua the &lt;strong&gt;Messiah&lt;/strong&gt;, as much as he saw. (Rev 1:2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and from Yeshua the &lt;strong&gt;Messiah&lt;/strong&gt;, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the earth&amp;rsquo;s kings. To him, the one who loves us, who has freed us from our sins at the cost of his blood, (Rev 1:5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seventh angel sounded his shofar; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, &amp;ldquo;The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and his &lt;strong&gt;Messiah&lt;/strong&gt;, and he will rule forever and ever!&amp;rdquo; (Rev 11:15)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, &amp;ldquo;Now have come God&amp;rsquo;s victory, power and kingship, and the authority of his &lt;strong&gt;Messiah&lt;/strong&gt;; because the Accuser of our brothers, who accuses them day and night before God, has been thrown out! (Rev 12:10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I saw thrones, and those seated on them received authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for testifying about Yeshua and proclaiming the Word of God, also those who had not worshipped the beast or its image and had not received the mark on their foreheads and on their hands. They came to life and ruled with the &lt;strong&gt;Messiah&lt;/strong&gt; for a thousand years. (Rev 20:4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blessed and holy is anyone who has a part in the first resurrection; over him the second death has no power. On the contrary, they will be cohanim of God and of the &lt;strong&gt;Messiah&lt;/strong&gt;, and they will rule with him for the thousand years. (Rev 20:6)
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-12-bore-witness&#34;&gt;Rev 1:2: Bore Witness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who &lt;mark&gt;bore witness&lt;/mark&gt; to the Word of God and to the &lt;mark&gt;testimony&lt;/mark&gt; of Yeshua the Messiah, as much as he saw.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;bore-witnesstestimony&#34;&gt;Bore witness/testimony&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John loves courtroom language (witness, testimony, testify, judge, judgment, authority (in the sense of legal standing), etc.). There are over 100 examples of this in John&amp;rsquo;s writings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John uses nearly the identical language in John 3:32-33 as he does in Revelation 1:2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Gospel, John portrayed evidence that Jesus was the proper authority. At the same time, the Jerusalem religious establishment were the usurpers, &amp;ldquo;bad shepherds,&amp;rdquo; an illegitimate regime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Revelation, he&amp;rsquo;s going to magnify that. The entire corrupt world system, not just the corrupt Jerusalem establishment, will be put on trial by God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, remember the context: believers in Asia were being betrayed to Roman courts. God grants true justice and righteous judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Seven Testimony verses&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
There are seven &#34;**Testimony**&#34; verses starting with 1:2. We can look at this list in a couple of ways.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are seven verses with &amp;ldquo;testimony&amp;rdquo; appearing twice in 19:10.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seven &amp;ldquo;Testimony of Jesus&amp;rdquo; references
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can remove 11:7 where &amp;ldquo;testimony &lt;strong&gt;of Jesus&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; is not directly implied – the two witnesses are testifying of God&amp;rsquo;s judgment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12:11 is directly implied as being martyred for their testimony of Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We count 19:10 twice for a total of seven&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who bore witness to the word of God and to the &lt;strong&gt;testimony of Jesus&lt;/strong&gt; Christ, even to all that he saw. (Rev 1:2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I, John, your brother and partner in the tribulation and the kingdom and the patient endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos on account of the word of God and the &lt;strong&gt;testimony of Jesus.&lt;/strong&gt; (Rev 1:9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;And when they have finished their&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;testimony&lt;/strong&gt;*, the beast that rises from the bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer them and kill them, (Rev 11:7)*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their &lt;strong&gt;testimony (of Jesus)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; for they loved not their lives even unto death. (Rev 12:11)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then the dragon became furious with the woman and went off to make war on the rest of her offspring, on those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the &lt;strong&gt;testimony of Jesus&lt;/strong&gt;. And he stood on the sand of the sea. (Rev 12:17)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, &amp;ldquo;You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold to the &lt;strong&gt;testimony of Jesus&lt;/strong&gt;. Worship God.&amp;rdquo; For the &lt;strong&gt;testimony of Jesus&lt;/strong&gt; is the Spirit of prophecy. (Rev 19:10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the &lt;strong&gt;testimony of Jesus&lt;/strong&gt; and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. (Rev 20:4)
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-13-the-blessing&#34;&gt;Rev 1:3: The Blessing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessed are the reader and hearers of the words of this prophecy, provided they obey the things written in it! For the time is near!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-blessing&#34;&gt;The blessing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the first of seven such blessings in the book (see callout below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation is the only book with such an explicit promise.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s no wonder the enemy tries to tell us it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to understand, and many have a spirit of fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversely, when believers wonder how they can be blessed by God, a biblical answer is &amp;ldquo;study Revelation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We aren&amp;rsquo;t told what form the blessing will be, but ANY gift from God will be great.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One such blessing may be that approaching Revelation as a Jewish book means you will read nearly 1000 verses from the Old Testament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another blessing is that we will walk away with a much more complete picture of our Savior&amp;rsquo;s person, mission, and destiny than we may have had previously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Greek carries the sense of read-aloud. Most people did not have their own copies of the Bible, so they would have had to hear it read aloud by the reader in the synagogue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that the blessing is conditional upon the reader understanding and obeying
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is very Hebraic. In Hebrew, verbs are action-oriented.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In English, we can listen, but we don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily equate hearing with obedience. In other words, we can listen passively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no such thought in Hebrew. If you don&amp;rsquo;t obey, you aren&amp;rsquo;t listening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stern writes, &amp;ldquo;in Judaism, learning is supposed to lead to doing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the 18th century, a Christian Hebraist named Franz Delitzsch translated the New Testament from Greek back into Biblical Hebrew, using forms and idioms the Old Testament uses. It is a highly educated guess on what the original Jewish authors might have said had their works recorded in their original Hebrew.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Revelation 1:3, he used a verb that frequently appears in the Torah of Moses – hear/obey (Shema) – שָׁמַע. This beautiful Hebrew word is rich with meaning and application. Talmidim hear and obey the words of Yeshua. Most notably, the word appears in Deut 6:4, which is the famous &amp;ldquo;Shema Israel&amp;rdquo; passage, which Jesus quotes in Mark 12:29.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;שְׁמַ֖ע&lt;/em&gt; יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵ֖ינוּ יְהוָ֥ה ׀ אֶחָֽד׃&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then Deuteronomy verse 5 continues, &amp;ldquo;You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;hear&amp;rdquo; is followed by a list of behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in a Name?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also contained within the word שָׁמַע are the letters שׁ and מ. When we put those together, we get שֶׁם (shem), which is the Hebrew word for name (Hebrew has five letters that are spelled differently when at the end of a word. The mem (מ/ם) is one of those).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your name is not just a string of letters. In Hebraic thought, your name is your reputation and your character. Being an obedient listener and one who diligently keeps/guards God&amp;rsquo;s word reflects on our reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, when we take on the name of Yeshua, we must positively reflect His character. We do that by keeping and guarding His words. In a sense this could be the third commandment. When we fail to keep and guard his name, we could be said to be taking on his name in vain. Conversely, there is a blessing to be had when we keep obey and guard His reputation.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;very-soon-and-for-the-time-is-near&#34;&gt;Very soon and for the time is near!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John believed the fulfillment of all things was very near.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He did not mean merely within a few years and certainly did not mean two thousand years! He is writing with a sense of urgency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fact, we can defend from Scripture that the New Testament authors didn&amp;rsquo;t just believe the &amp;ldquo;end times&amp;rdquo; were near; they thought the end times were upon them.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See 1 Corinthians 10:11 and note that Paul directly connects the Old Testament with the &amp;ldquo;end times.&amp;rdquo; Further, the &amp;ldquo;end times&amp;rdquo; IS the fulfillment of Old Testament Prophecies.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The above point is critically important to keep in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul and John weren&amp;rsquo;t looking to events occurring in the world around them; they were looking to the &amp;ldquo;fulfillment of the purposes and prophecies of the Old Testament.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An alternate sense could be once the events commence, they will unfold rapidly;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 Peter 3:3-4 seems to imply Peter at least suspected there would be some delay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet, at the end of the passage (2 Peter 3:10), Peter says every believer should be alert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Seven Blessings&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are seven &lt;em&gt;berachot&lt;/em&gt; (blessings) starting with 1:3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed&lt;/strong&gt; are the reader and hearers of the words of this prophecy, provided they obey the things written in it! For the time is near! (Rev 1:3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed&lt;/strong&gt; are the dead who die in the Lord (Rev 14:13).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed&lt;/strong&gt; is he that watches and keeps his garments (Rev 16:15).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed&lt;/strong&gt; are they who are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb (Rev 19:9).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed&lt;/strong&gt; and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection (Rev 20:6).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed&lt;/strong&gt; is he that keeps the words of the prophecy of this book (Rev 22:7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed&lt;/strong&gt; are they that wash their robes (Rev 22:14).
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4. From: Yochanan To: The seven Messianic communities in the province of Asia:  Grace and shalom to you from the One who is, who was and who is coming; from the sevenfold Spirit before his throne;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1:4 Isa 11: 2 And the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;from-yochananjohn&#34;&gt;From Yochanan/John&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While we can&amp;rsquo;t be 100% certain, most conservative scholars believe this is John the Apostle (see the introductory lesson for more background)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whichever John this was, we might say &amp;ldquo;he needed no introduction.&amp;rdquo; We are given no further background than &amp;ldquo;John,&amp;rdquo; indicating that he was well-known to his audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several early church writers believed the letter was a forgery and argued that the book should not become part of the New Testament canon.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They based this view partly because the Greek of Revelation is borderline substandard quality, particularly compared to the Gospel of John.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This may be explained. The Gospel was composed with a translator, someone learned in Greek, which John was not. On Patmos, John was left with his limited Greek skills.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;seven-communitieschurches&#34;&gt;Seven communities/&amp;ldquo;churches&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/49f033022fe7e954bd6946926032fbc0.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immediately there is underlying tension we might miss.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are in Asia. Modern Turkey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jews aren&amp;rsquo;t supposed to be outside Eretz Israel (the land of Israel)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a big clue that things are out of order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the end of the book, they will be back in the Land&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We talked about this anachronism of the word &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; during the introduction.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The church, either an institution or a gathering of people, did not exist when John wrote.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is hard not to call them &amp;ldquo;the seven churches.&amp;rdquo; If we do, we need to be aware of the anachronism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number &amp;ldquo;seven&amp;rdquo; is a fingerprint of the Holy Spirit and speaks of completeness and fulfillment. It can also carry a sense of holiness/set apartness-the Shabbat (7th day) is a time to be set apart from the other six days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whatever other interpretations of Revelation may be plausible, we must remember first and foremost it was written to actual first-century congregations with real struggles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we look at a map&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, the seven cities are in relative proximity. We can easily imagine the letter starting in Ephesus and traveling clockwise to Smyrna, using the Roman road system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, there were many more than seven congregations in Asia (one received a letter from Paul, Colossians).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t exactly know why these seven were called out
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indeed, these seven had real problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problems are likely typical of what other fellowships were going through at the time.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each letter will end with &amp;ldquo;hear what the Spirit says to the church&lt;em&gt;es&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; (i.e., the words are directed to all fellowships, not just the specific one addressed).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster speculates that many fellowships likely existed in each town. In other words, there was probably not merely one assembly in Ephesus.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He says that although it is unlikely there were separate fellowships for Gentiles (as the Jew/Gentile split in Christianity had not yet occurred, or at best was only in its infancy), there may have been separate meetings for Believers in Messiah that were distinct from other Jewish fellowships.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This could explain why some believers had been arrested and martyred, but others in the same town had not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;grace-and-shalom-peace&#34;&gt;Grace and Shalom (Peace)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This could be a combination of the Greek &lt;em&gt;Charis&lt;/em&gt; (grace) and the Hebrew &lt;em&gt;shalom&lt;/em&gt; (peace)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr Bolen writes: &amp;ldquo;the greeting seems to combine a common formulaic openings in Greco-Roman and Semitic letters.&amp;rdquo; Grace&amp;quot; (Gk. charis, χάρις) is related to the common Greek word &amp;ldquo;greetings&amp;rdquo; (Gk. chairein, χαίρειν) as seen in Acts 15:23, 23:26, and James 1:1 (cf. Matt 26:49, Mark 15:18, Luke 1:28, and John 19:3). &amp;ldquo;Peace&amp;rdquo; (Gk. eirēnē, εἰρήνη; Heb. shalōm, שָׁלוֹם) is a common Semitic greeting as seen in Luke 10:5, 24:36, and John 20:19.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potentially, both meanings are encompassed by the rich Hebrew word &lt;em&gt;shalom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dan Stolebarger says that when we wish someone &amp;ldquo;shalom,&amp;rdquo; we are wishing them &amp;ldquo;peace as it was before the Fall.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;True Shalom comes when God makes everything right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-trinity&#34;&gt;The Trinity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verses 4-5 are widely and correctly viewed as &lt;strong&gt;the Trinity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this case, the order is Father, Spirit, Son, which is consistent with John&amp;rsquo;s overall view that Jesus is (somehow) subordinate to the Father. It is the Spirit who empowers the Son.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Father – John uses an identical phrase as the Septuagint translation of Exodus 3:14.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Hebrew, this is unmistakable. “I am who I am” אֶֽהְיֶ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶֽהְיֶ֑ה (ehyeh asher eheyh).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general terms, God is transcendent. Missler says, &amp;ldquo;Time is a physical property subject to mass acceleration and gravity. God&amp;rsquo;s not subject to those. God is not someone with lots of time. He&amp;rsquo;s outside our time domain altogether. He knows the end from the beginning.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that the &amp;ldquo;Father&amp;rdquo; is also described as One who…&amp;quot; is coming&amp;quot; – we usually think of Jesus, the Son, as the One who is coming again. Still, in some sense, the Father is also coming.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Zechariah 14:4, Adonai will set His foot upon the Mount of Olives. The text doesn&amp;rsquo;t say, &amp;ldquo;Messiah will set foot upon the Mount of Olives.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In some places in Scripture, we see some distinction among the roles.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus sits at the right hand of the Father (Acts 2:33)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus doesn&amp;rsquo;t pray to Himself or the Spirit, but to the Father, and says His job is to glorify the Father. (John 17:1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In others, we see a blurring of roles.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both Adonai, whom we usually view as &amp;ldquo;The Father,&amp;rdquo; and Jesus say, &amp;ldquo;I am the first and the last.&amp;rdquo; (Father in Rev 1:8, Son in Rev 1:17).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul says the Spirit caused Jesus to rise from the Dead (Rom 8:11), and he also says it was the Father (Gal 1:1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In several locations, Jesus says He is the &amp;ldquo;I AM&amp;rdquo; of our Old Testament.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lizorkin and Shir phrase it like this: &amp;ldquo;The Son and the Father are distinct, but somehow so connected that they cannot always be distinguished.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the better comparisons I&amp;rsquo;ve heard to describe the Trinity is as three partners in a corporation. Each partner may act independently, but legally the corporation is one unit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All models are clumsy because we are trying to describe the infiniteness of God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bottom line is the more we can remain flexible in our concepts of the Trinity, the less befuddling Revelation will be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sevenfold-spirit&#34;&gt;Sevenfold Spirit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This could also be rendered &amp;ldquo;seven spirits.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number seven represents completeness. Therefore &amp;ldquo;sevenfold Spirit&amp;rdquo; is likely simply describing the Spirit as the complete and perfect Spirit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewish tradition sees seven archangels.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster and Lizorkin/Shir dive into this in their commentaries and believe this is potentially in John&amp;rsquo;s view, given his Jewish background. They connect this verse with the seven angels that repeatedly appear in the book.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster notes the parallel in the description of the person giving the revelation between Revelation 1:9-18 and Daniel 10.  In Daniel 10, the messenger is clearly a supernatural angel, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a member of the Trinity.  We will discuss this further in the next lesson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lizorkin and Shir are also skeptical of the connection to Isaiah 11:2, which is often cited as a parallel passage. &amp;ldquo;This does not explain why there are seven spirits mentioned in Revelation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They caution that we may be force-reading our view of the trinity into this passage when that may not be what John intended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Seven angels&amp;rdquo; appear repeatedly in Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;td&gt;5. and from Yeshua the Messiah, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead and the ruler of the earth&amp;rsquo;s kings. To him, the one who loves us, who has freed us from our sins at the cost of his blood,  6. who has caused us to be a kingdom, that is, Cohanim for God, his Father—to him be the glory and the rulership forever and ever. Amen.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1:5 Gen 49: 11 Binding his foal to the vine and his donkey&amp;rsquo;s colt to the choice vine, he has washed his garments in wine and his vesture in the blood of grapes. Psa 89:27 And I will make him the firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.   1:6 Ex 19:5-6 Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; 6 and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&amp;rsquo; These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel.&amp;quot; Isa 61:6 but you shall be called the priests of the LORD; they shall speak of you as the ministers of our God; you shall eat the wealth of the nations, and in their glory you shall boast.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;firstborn-of-the-dead&#34;&gt;Firstborn of the dead&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not to say that Jesus was the first ever to be raised from the dead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Judaism, &amp;ldquo;firstborn&amp;rdquo; is a title of inheritance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The firstborn would receive a double-portion.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While usually, this was the eldest son, the eldest son could forfeit the title of firstborn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joseph was the 11th of Jacob&amp;rsquo;s 12 sons, yet was the titular Firstborn who received a double portion of Jacob&amp;rsquo;s inheritance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Jewish feast of firstfruits is also in view (always on Sunday after Passover).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This title is synonymous with victory .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because Jesus conquered death, we can (and will!) too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ruler-of-the-earths-kingsone-who-loves-usfreed-uscaused-us-to-be-cohanim-priests&#34;&gt;Ruler of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s Kings/One who loves us/Freed us/Caused us to be Cohanim (priests)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1 Corinthians 15 (the &amp;ldquo;resurrection chapter&amp;rdquo;), Paul connects the dots – since Jesus is the firstborn of the dead, He will come again and &amp;ldquo;hand over the Kingdom to God the Father, after having put an end to every rulership, yes, to every authority and power.&amp;rdquo; (1Co 15:24)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To an audience fearful of persecution, these words remind them who is truly in charge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversely, the challenge for us is whether we have indeed submitted to his kingship, or are we still telling Him, &amp;ldquo;I got this&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we submit to Him, it&amp;rsquo;s good to know that He loves us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation tells the outcome for those who tell God, &amp;ldquo;I got this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exodus 19:5-6: Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&amp;rsquo; These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of this has to do with how we spend our time in this life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Seven components to the description of Messiah&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is the faithful witness (or &amp;ldquo;the faithful martyr&amp;rdquo;; see Rev_2:13).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is the firstborn (or &amp;ldquo;foremost, chief&amp;rdquo;) of those who get raised from the dead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is the ruler of the earth&amp;rsquo;s kings, the &amp;ldquo;King of Kings&amp;rdquo; (Rev_17:14, Rev_19:16) who will one day subject to himself even the most unbridled and oppressive governments (1Co_15:24-25).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He loves us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He causes us to be freed from our sins at the cost of his blood (that is, by his bloody, sacrificial death; see Rom_3:24).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He causes us to be a kingdom, a community subject to him who loves us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He causes us to be cohanim (&amp;ldquo;priests&amp;rdquo;) for God, his Father.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern notes that the first three attributes would have brought immediate comfort to the faithful. Because He loves us, we gain the final three &amp;ldquo;benefits&amp;rdquo; as we might call them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Sevens: &amp;lsquo;Amen!&amp;rsquo;&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen is a Hebrew word that connotes &amp;ldquo;truth&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;may it be so.&amp;rdquo; Every time you say &amp;ldquo;amen,&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;re speaking Hebrew! Yay you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who has caused us to be a kingdom, that is, cohanim for God, his Father—to him be the glory and the rulership forever and ever. &lt;strong&gt;Amen&lt;/strong&gt;. (Rev 1:6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look! He is coming with the clouds! Every eye will see him, including those who pierced him; and all the tribes of the Land will mourn him. Yes! &lt;strong&gt;Amen&lt;/strong&gt;! (Rev 1:7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Laodicea, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the &lt;strong&gt;Amen&lt;/strong&gt;, the faithful and true witness, the Ruler of God&amp;rsquo;s creation: (Rev 3:14)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The four living beings said, &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Amen&lt;/strong&gt;!&amp;rdquo; and the elders fell down and worshipped. (Rev 5:14)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Amen! &amp;ldquo;Praise and glory, wisdom and thanks, honor and power and strength belong to our God forever and ever! &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Amen&lt;/strong&gt;!&amp;rdquo; (Rev 7:12)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The twenty-four elders and the four living beings fell down and worshipped God, sitting on the throne, and said, &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Amen&lt;/strong&gt;! Halleluyah!&amp;rdquo; (Rev 19:4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The one who is testifying to these things says, &amp;lsquo;Yes, I am coming soon!&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;Amen&lt;/strong&gt;! Come, Lord Yeshua! (Rev 22:20)
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7. Look! He is coming with the clouds! Every eye will see him, including those who pierced him; and all the tribes of the Land will mourn him. Yes! Amen!  8. &amp;ldquo;I am the &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;Z,&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; says Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, the One who is, who was and who is coming.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1:7 Dan 7:13-14 &amp;ldquo;I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. &lt;br&gt;Zech 12:10-14 &amp;ldquo;And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and pleas for mercy, so that, when they look on me, on him whom they have pierced, they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only child, and weep bitterly over him, as one weeps over a firstborn. 11 On that day the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning for Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo. 12 The land shall mourn, each family by itself: the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves; 13 the family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself, and their wives by themselves; 14 and all the families that are left, each by itself, and their wives by themselves. &lt;br&gt; 1:8 Isa 41:4 Who has performed and done this, calling the generations from the beginning? I, the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;look-behold-he-comes&#34;&gt;Look! Behold He comes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hebrew word for &amp;ldquo;behold&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;hinei&amp;rdquo; and it frequently appears in the Old Testament
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may have learned that the word &amp;ldquo;therefore&amp;rdquo; is a clue, particularly in Paul&amp;rsquo;s writings. The saying goes, &amp;ldquo;whenever you see a &amp;rsquo;therefore,&amp;rsquo; you always want to ask, &amp;lsquo;what is it there for?&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conceptually the same is true for &amp;ldquo;behold&amp;rdquo; in the Old Testament. The author is calling something to our attention in the narrative. We want to make sure we know what is we are beholding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Hineini!  הִנֵנִי&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely related to the word &amp;ldquo;hinei&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;heneini.&amp;rdquo; In Genesis 22, when God calls out,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Avraham! Avraham!&amp;rdquo; Abraham answers in Hebrew, &amp;ldquo;Hineini!&amp;rdquo; – translated as &amp;ldquo;here am I&amp;rdquo; but also the purpose of Behold, me! In the sense of &amp;ldquo;I am available, pick me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah also says &amp;ldquo;Hineini&amp;rdquo; in Isaiah 6:8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an expression that God values your &lt;em&gt;avail&lt;/em&gt;ability more than he values your ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a great Hebrew prayer, just tell God, &amp;ldquo;Hineini!&amp;rdquo; Look! I&amp;rsquo;m available!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;clouds&#34;&gt;Clouds&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare Acts 1:11 – He will return very similar to how He ascended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel 7 talks about the Messiah emerging from clouds and going before the Ancient of Days. There the Father gives the Son all things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A minor note that whoever is speaking switches to the 3rd person in verse seven, and then God will take over in Verse 8. Figuring out who is speaking is not nearly as important as the truth of the words spoken. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to notice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-tribes-will-mourn&#34;&gt;The tribes will mourn&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protestant/Pre-tribulation theology holds that once these events happen, there may be little, if any, hope for any unbeliever to repent, least of all traditional Jews who are cursed for rejecting their Messiah and forfeited all of their promises to the Church. This view stems from Replacement Theology. See the callout note below for additional information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zechariah 13:11 tells a different story. They will mourn him but that not the end of the story.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The people specifically from the House of David will be cleansed from their sins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore a &amp;ldquo;terminal&amp;rdquo; judgment may not be what John is communicating in verse 7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mourning may be that of a repentant heart; the same heart we should have when we ponder the price He truly paid for us. Through his sacrifice, all the families of the Earth shall be blessed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Replacement Theology&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a personal note, ever since my first trip to Israel in 2010, my eyes have been more open to the fact that we hold in our hands a single book, which in the hands of gentile church leaders all but stripped it of its Jewishness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, come to find our Messiah/Christ is Jewish. All the writers of the New Testament were Jewish. As best we can tell, Luke was a gentile convert to Judaism. The Bible, first and foremost, is about the redemption of Israel and the coming Messianic Kingdom; Revelation is the culmination of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roman 11 says the Gentiles have been grafted in and should not boast about our superiority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a nasty theory that goes by the name of Replacement Theology, which says that because Israel rejected and crucified her Messiah, all the promises meant for Israel in the Old Testament now have their spiritual fulfillment in the Church. Other components include the beliefs that Jesus and Paul forsook their Judaism and founded a gentile religion. It is said that Jesus was a sabbath breaker and Paul disregarded the dietary laws. All of these are provable as false if we do Acts 17:11 research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with this general theory is it makes God an untrustworthy liar, the Old Testament irrelevant, the law as opposite of grace, and causes us to see Jews as enemies. Replacement Theology is a tare that the enemy has planted, which has grown up alongside the nutritious kernels of solid doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must guard against Replacement Theology as this violates the two great commandments. If we view God as able to break His promises, how can we say we &amp;ldquo;love the Lord our God with our whole hearts, minds, and strengths?&amp;rdquo; If we ascribe the evil deeds of what may have been less than 20 corrupt religious leaders and blame an entire race of people, how can we say we &amp;ldquo;love our neighbors as ourselves?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Replacement Theology is a lie that has been repeated so often for the last 1500 years that it seeps into otherwise educated and insightful men writing contemporary commentaries. I may agree with 90% of everything else a given commentator says but if there is even a hint of Replacement Theology, I&amp;rsquo;m going to do my best to call it out and correct the errant conclusion.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;td&gt;1:8 Isa 41:4 Who has performed and done this, calling the generations from the beginning? I, the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;alpha-and-omegaa-and-zaleph-and-tav&#34;&gt;Alpha and Omega/A and Z/Aleph and Tav&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We typically think of Jesus as saying He is the Alpha and the Omega, but note here, we would say it is &amp;ldquo;God the Father&amp;rdquo; speaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phrase also appears in Rev 21:6 and Rev 22:13.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Hebrew, the first and last letters are Aleph א and Tav ת.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The word אֵת (et) has a unique function in Hebrew. See the callout box if you are interested in learning more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note again that the Father says He &amp;ldquo;is coming.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another one of God&amp;rsquo;s names in the Hebrew Bible is El Shaddai - which is God almighty in the sense of the protector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;The Aleph and the Tav&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word אֵת is most often used as a grammatical marker in the Bible. It is used to indicate a definite direct object. When used this way, it has no direct translational value. It is spelled with Aleph (א) and tav (ת).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional Jewish exegesis (a fancy word for &amp;ldquo;Bible study&amp;rdquo;) sees four layers of meaning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The literal surface meaning – we always start here, and the deeper interpretations must never contradict the base meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is called a &amp;ldquo;hint of something deeper.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A comparative meaning often drawn from the conclusion of similar words/phrases among passages.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 19:18 contain the exact phrase, &amp;ldquo;and you shall love.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus was employing this level of interpretation when He linked these two verses as &amp;ldquo;the greatest commandment&amp;rdquo; – &amp;ldquo;and you shall love the Lord your God…&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;and you shall love your neighbor…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An esoteric mystical meaning (obviously, we use this one with caution).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a &amp;ldquo;hint of something deeper,&amp;rdquo; several verses in Hebrew can take on an added deeper meaning when we consider that Jesus called Himself the &amp;ldquo;Aleph and the Tav.&amp;rdquo; Let&amp;rsquo;s look at just three of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genesis 1:1 – the very first verse in the Bible:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים &lt;strong&gt;אֵת&lt;/strong&gt; הַשָּׁמַיִם &lt;strong&gt;וְאֵת&lt;/strong&gt; הָאָרֶץ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curiously there are also precisely seven Hebrew words. In the beginning (all one word) created God (et) the heaven (et) the earth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could we also say that in the beginning, God, &lt;strong&gt;the Aleph, and Tav&lt;/strong&gt;, created the heavens, and &lt;strong&gt;the Aleph and Tav&lt;/strong&gt; created the world? I believe we could.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genesis 1:4
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;וַיַּ֧רְא אֱלֹהִ֛ים &lt;strong&gt;אֶת&lt;/strong&gt;־הָא֖וֹר כִּי־ט֑וֹב&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And God saw the light, and it was good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And God saw &lt;strong&gt;the Aleph and Tav&lt;/strong&gt;, the Light, and it was good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zechariah 12:10
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;והביטו אלי &lt;strong&gt;את&lt;/strong&gt; אשׁר־דקרו&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They will look upon me whom they have pierced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They will look upon me, &lt;strong&gt;the Aleph and Tav,&lt;/strong&gt; whom they have pierced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Seven &amp;lsquo;LORD, God Almighty&amp;rsquo;&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the literal phrase used in the Old Testament (אֱלֹהֵֽי־צְבָא֖וֹת which sometimes gets translated as &amp;ldquo;God of Hosts&amp;rdquo;, and commonly, but &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; poorly transliterated as &amp;ldquo;Jehovah Sabaoth&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am the &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;Z,&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; says Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, the One who is, who was and who is coming. (Rev 1:8)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each of the four living beings had six wings and was covered with eyes inside and out; and day and night they never stop saying, &amp;ldquo;Holy, holy, holy is Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies the One who was, who is and who is coming!&amp;rdquo; (Rev 4:8)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;saying, &amp;ldquo;We thank you, Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, the One who is and was, that you have taken your power and have begun to rule. (Rev 11:17)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They were singing the song of Moshe, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb: &amp;ldquo;Great and wonderful are the things you have done, Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies! Just and true are your ways, king of the nations! (Rev 15:3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I heard the altar say, &amp;ldquo;Yes, Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, your judgments are true and just!&amp;rdquo; (Rev 16:7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I heard what sounded like the roar of a huge crowd, like the sound of rushing waters, like loud peals of thunder, saying, &amp;ldquo;Halleluyah! Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, has begun his reign! (Rev 19:6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I saw no Temple in the city, for Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, is its Temple, as is the Lamb. (Rev 21:22)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why &amp;ldquo;Adonai&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many of our English Bibles, when translators came across what is called the &amp;ldquo;Tetragrammaton&amp;rdquo; (The Hebrew word for God&amp;rsquo;s name spelled yod-hei-vav-hei), they typically render it as &lt;small&gt;LORD&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, they are preserving a Jewish custom that was in place during the time of Jesus&amp;rsquo; ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observant Jews will never attempt to pronounce this name. Instead, they will say &amp;ldquo;Adonai&amp;rdquo; if in a formal/religious setting or &amp;ldquo;Hashem,&amp;rdquo; Hebrew for &amp;ldquo;The Name,&amp;rdquo; if in a less formal setting. This purposeful avoidance of using God&amp;rsquo;s sacred Name is called a &amp;ldquo;circumlocution.&amp;rdquo; Jesus used circumlocutions many times and NEVER pronounced the Name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage our students to use a circumlocution such as &amp;ldquo;Lord&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Adonai.&amp;rdquo;. It shows similar honor as not calling your parents by their first name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, &amp;ldquo;Jehovah&amp;rdquo; is a made-up word. Some Hebrew Bibles add the vowels from &amp;ldquo;Adonai&amp;rdquo; to the Tetragrammaton. This is to remind readers to say &amp;ldquo;Adonai.&amp;rdquo; When some non-Hebrew speaker mistakenly tried to pronounce this non-word, he came up with &amp;ldquo;Jehovah.&amp;rdquo; Don&amp;rsquo;t call God &amp;ldquo;Jehovah.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s not a real word!
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;El Shaddai&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever been to a Jewish home, you may have noticed something long and narrow attached to an outer door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/e5d1e7831cd11a6b9ef323c77f8d1a18.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;33%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is called a Mezuzah and it comes from a command in Deu 6:9 You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Referring to the Shema, you shall love the Lord with all your heart, all your soul and all your might.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inside the Mezuzah will be a scroll with the Shema and other passages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the outside of the Mezuzah will be the Hebrew letter Shin, the W looking character you can see on this mezuzah. The shin is short for Shaddai.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Mezuzah serves as a reminder that God almighty is the great protector and in return He asks for our love and obedience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll say this a lot but remember John&amp;rsquo;s original audience was under a death sentence for practicing their faith. They neeed to be reminded of God&amp;rsquo;s almighty-ness and His protection and provision. God&amp;rsquo;s army is WAAAAY more powerful than the Roman army.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I, Yochanan, am a brother of yours and a fellow-sharer in the suffering, kingship, and perseverance that come from being united with Yeshua. I had been exiled to the island called Patmos for having proclaimed the message of God and borne witness to Yeshua.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 10:2-4 In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three weeks. 3 I ate no delicacies, no meat or wine entered my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, for the full three weeks. 4 On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river (that is, the Tigris)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;exiled-to-patmos&#34;&gt;Exiled to Patmos&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/4ba61b20eea37afb7fb8d31162fcbb1a.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John is positioning himself as an equal, not a superior; an empathizer not a sympathizer.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We discussed how John came to be at Patmos during our background lesson.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patmos is a relatively small Greek island (17.5 sq mi) about 35 miles off the coast of Turkey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were two levels of Roman exile&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first was actual deportation (&lt;em&gt;deportatio in insulaim&lt;/em&gt;), in which the prisoner lost all rights; this was permanent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second was what we might call a relegation (&lt;em&gt;relegation ad insulam&lt;/em&gt;), which was a temporary banishment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It appears John fell into the second group. In any case, the Romans did not want the Gospel going out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surrounded by water, it is no surprise that the sea is a dominant image throughout the book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the fifth century, the &amp;ldquo;Cave of the Apocalypse&amp;rdquo; has been venerated to mark the site where John received visitation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Photo credit:&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;proclaimed-the-message-of-god&#34;&gt;Proclaimed the message of God&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This will be a recurring theme as many believers will be martyred for this reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We believe John wasn&amp;rsquo;t directly martyred but died of natural causes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, if we believe the tradition, Domitian ordered John boiled in oil, yet John was spared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Jewish mind would say that John &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; martyred, and then he was delivered by God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;daniel-10-as-parallel-passage&#34;&gt;Daniel 10 as parallel passage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a parallel of Revelation 1:9-20 and Daniel 10, which we will explore next lesson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For now, note the similarities of 1:9 to Daniel 10:2-4.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They both have a &amp;ldquo;double&amp;rdquo; introduction for emphasis (&amp;ldquo;I, John&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;I, Daniel&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both can be said to be physically suffering for God (John externally and Daniel internally through a three-week fast).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both are in exile (John at Patmos, Daniel on the bank of the Tigres in Babylon).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-110-in-the-spirit-on-the-day-of-the-lord&#34;&gt;Rev 1:10: In the Spirit on the Day of the Lord&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;I came to be, in the Spirit, on the Day of the Lord; and I heard behind me a loud voice, like a trumpet&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;i-came-to-be-in-the-spirit&#34;&gt;I came to be in the Spirit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three primary options, each of which is a conjecture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John&amp;rsquo;s received a vision but was not physically transported anywhere, like a dream (and it was not uncommon for people to receive messages from God via dreams)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John had what we might call an &amp;ldquo;out of body experience&amp;rdquo;; his body remained on Patmos, but he was otherwise transported to the heavenly throne&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John was physically present&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2 Corinthians 12:2, Paul says, &amp;ldquo;whether in the body or out of the body, I do not know.&amp;rdquo;  Maybe John himself didn&amp;rsquo;t know either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;day-of-the-lordlords-day&#34;&gt;Day of the Lord/Lord&amp;rsquo;s Day&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was this a weekday or a moment in time? The possibilities discussed below are conjecture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Sunday
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While this is the day we honor the resurrection, there is no biblical evidence that the first day of the week was ever referred to as &amp;ldquo;The Lord&amp;rsquo;s day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Saturday
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Genesis 2, Exodus 16, and Exodus 20, if there is one day of the week that God holds holy, it&amp;rsquo;s Saturday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a direct connection between the Sabbath and the kingdom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, the Bible never refers to Shabbat as &amp;ldquo;the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Day&amp;rdquo; either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This view is further rendered unlikely since John was told to write, a creative activity widely considered prohibited on Shabbat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John was not referencing a specific day of the week, but a particular moment in time: &lt;strong&gt;the fulfillment and restoration of all things.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are NUMEROUS biblical references for the &amp;ldquo;Day of the Lord&amp;rdquo; to support this view: (Is. 2:12; 13:6-9; Ezek. 13:5, 30:3; Joel 1:15; 2:1-31; 3:14; Amos 5:18-20; Obad. 15; Zeph 1:7-14; Zech 14:1; Mal 4:5).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is where I tend to land.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John wasn&amp;rsquo;t telling us the day of the week so much as he told us the moment in time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As Stern comments, for John to note the day of the week would be a minor if not an entirely insignificant detail. For John to say he was present for the final judgment is monumentally significant.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-loud-voice-like-a-trumpet&#34;&gt;A loud voice like a trumpet&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hebrew for loud voice &lt;em&gt;kol gadol –&lt;/em&gt; this is also how the Bible describes thunder or a deafening noise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Daniel 10:6, &amp;ldquo;the sound of his words were like the sound of a multitude.&amp;rdquo; (photo credit&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). John hears the same sound, but it is &amp;ldquo;loud voice, like a trumpet&amp;rdquo; to him.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Greek does not indicate whether the trumpet is a &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt; (a ram&amp;rsquo;s horn made into a trumpet) or a brass trumpet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A brass trumpet would connote a call to battle, while a shofar would connote a call to worship. Either may be applicable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later in chapter 1, John will more clearly describe a &lt;em&gt;menorah&lt;/em&gt;, so precisely, a &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt;, also used in the Jewish Temple service, looks likely here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In any case, when a Jew such as John heard a trumpet, he knew it was a call to assemble and prepare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;th&gt;OT Allusions&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11. saying, &amp;ldquo;Write down what you see on a scroll, and send it to the seven Messianic communities—Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1:11 Isa 30:8 And now, go, write it before them on a tablet and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come as a witness forever.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John wrote the vision down right away not just to remember it but also so it would function as a testimony.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The person receiving an apocalypse was often told to &amp;ldquo;seal up&amp;rdquo; the words. Not so with John. This is to be an &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Photo credit: &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will discuss the background of the seven cities when we get to chapters 2-3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Seven First and Last?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The KJV adds, &amp;ldquo;I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last&amp;rdquo; before the instruction to write.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This phrase is not contained in the newer translations (NIV, ESV, NLT, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As familiar as the phrase &amp;ldquo;First and Last&amp;rdquo; is, it only occurs three times in Isaiah and then, according to KJV, four times in Revelation for a total of seven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this instance, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t surprise me if the KJV is correct and the other translations were mistaken in omitting &amp;ldquo;I am the first and the last&amp;rdquo; from verse 11.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah 41:4 Who has performed and done this, calling the generations from the beginning? I, the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah 44:6 Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: “I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah 48:12  “Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel, whom I called! I am he; I am the first, and I am the last.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revelation 1:11&lt;/em&gt; (disputed) Saying, &lt;em&gt;I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and,&lt;/em&gt; What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation 1:17 And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation 2:8 And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation 22:13  I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 12 will begin a very unusual description of Jesus (or perhaps a blurring of the entire Godhead). We will pick this up next time, but there is one crucial point to make. The picture of Jesus in our minds may be quite different from the Jesus of Revelation. We must be conformed to his image and not force God to conform to our image. As we have been saying, we need not cling too tightly to any preconceptions. Revelation may challenge a lot of them. Part of the blessing from reading Revelation comes with our own unveiling; that is, when our biases and bloodspots are exposed and resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One tell-tale sign of this in the Gospels is when people pick up stones to stone Jesus. We may miss what is going on, but in the people&amp;rsquo;s minds, Jesus had just committed blasphemy by equating Himself to God (or as Christians would say, &amp;ldquo;God the Father&amp;rdquo;). The penalty for blasphemy is death by stoning.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GENEALOGIES demonstrates to us that Jesus is of the &amp;ldquo;house and lineage&amp;rdquo; of King David. Once, when Jesus was passing through the streets, some blind men called out to Him, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!” Why did they call Him “Son of David”? What does that title mean, and what is Jesus’ relationship to King David? In this chapter we explore the family tree of the Messiah.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The book of the generations (genealogy) of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen 5:1&lt;/sup&gt; This is the book of the generations of Adam. When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Son of Abraham = means a Jew. Matthew wants us to know that Jesus is Jewish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Son of David is a clear Messianic title. Matthew wants us to know that Jesus is the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew presents his genealogy in the Hebraic style of Genesis 5:1, which reads “this (is the) book of the generations of Adam” (although it is Luke, not Matthew, who presents us the lineage back to Adam).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genealogies were important legal documents to demonstrate lineage for the purposes of inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically records were kept in the temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was destroyed in 70 CE so were most of the records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, ANYONE after 70 CE could claim to be descended from David and there would be no way to prove or disprove it. A few would-be messiahs in history even tried to fabricate their lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the claim for Jesus’ lineage was made when it could still have been checked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen 17:7&lt;/sup&gt; And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2Sa 7:16&lt;/sup&gt; And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a candidate for Messiah is not a descendant from David AND Abraham, he is to be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God made eternal and unconditional covenants with both Abraham and David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 1:1 is the most important verse of the chapter as it establishes Jesus in both David’s line and Abraham’s line (with the remainder of the genealogy used to support the assertion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:2.60856in;height:1.95614in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Deu 17:15&lt;/sup&gt; you may indeed set a king over you whom the LORD your God will choose. &lt;strong&gt;One from among your brothers you shall set as king over you. You may not put a foreigner over you, who is not your brother&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any king, including, and especially the Messiah had to be Jewish by law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have an interesting Juxtaposition between Jesus, the rightful king, and King Herod, the presently reigning king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dichotomy is accented by geography. Above is a picture of Herod’s palace called Herodium (of course he named it after himself). Herodium is about 3 miles from Bethlehem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To varying degrees, all of the gospels portray Jesus the rightful king, messiah, and Son battling against the usurping forces, be they Herod, the political/religious establishment or the forces of spiritual darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herod, was NOT BORN King of the Jews, in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. He’s wasn’t Jewish by birth. He was an Idumean, which is to say an edomite, descended from Esau not Jacob. If you know anything about the history, the Edomites and the Israelites didn’t get along at all. During the period of the Maccabees, Herod’s family was forced to convert. Forced conversions, whether done by the greeks under Antiochus IV, the Jews under the Maccabeans, or the Christians and Muslims in later years, never seem to work out very well for both the converted and those forcing the conversions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. He therefore was not qualified to be King. In fact, he approached the Roman Senate to grant him that title, which they did in 39 BC. And in an irony of History, Rome didn’t even control the area at the time. The Parthians did. Herod pushed them out and secured the area for Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This adds some possible intrigue to &lt;sup&gt;Mat 2:1-2&lt;/sup&gt; Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, [2] saying, “Where is he who has been &lt;strong&gt;born king of the Jews&lt;/strong&gt;? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Magi approach Herod and ask, “where is he who has been BORN KING OF THE JEWS?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck Missler sees this as an intentional dig at Herod. In other words, “Not you, turkey. Where’s the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; king of the Jews?” Which of course sends Herod off in a fit of rage and we know from Matthew 2:4-5, Herod inquired of the birthplace of Messiah and was told it would be in Bethlehem. Eventually, he orders the execution of all males 2 years and younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, before this episode, the Talmud records that Herod once approached his leaders for the qualifications of a Jewish leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Sanhedrin explained Deuteronomy 17:15 to Herod, telling him that one must be naturally born Jewish, Herod naturally, was not pleased with the explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He ordered the execution of all of the Sanhedrin except one (b. Bava Batra 3b), which tells you all about Herod. “don’t shoot the messenger” was not in his vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster notes that Herod then sought to destroy all such records and people of the Davidic Royal line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This likely forced any direct descendant of David to flee from Bethlehem, just a stone’s throw away from Herod’s palace at Herodium, to the relative obscurity in Nazareth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far from being a boring list of names, the fact that Matthew’s genealogy is preserved may be the first recorded miracle in his gospel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.32569in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 1:1 establishes Jesus in David’s line and also in Abraham’s line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אדם  &lt;/span&gt;= Abraham, David, Messiah according to the sages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;matthew-12-6--abraham-to-solomon--luke-3138-adam-to-nathan&#34;&gt;Matthew 1:2-6 – Abraham to Solomon &amp;amp; Luke 31:38 Adam to Nathan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 1:2-6 ↓&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luke 3:38-31 ↑&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah and his brothers, Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Hezron, Ram, Amminadab, Nahshon, Salmon, Boaz by Rahab, Obed by Ruth, Jesse, David the king. And David was the father of &lt;strong&gt;Solomon&lt;/strong&gt; by the wife of Uriah…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Adam the Son of God, Seth, Enosh, Cainan, Mahalalel, Jared, Enoch, Methuseleh, Lamech, Noah, Shem, Arphaxhad, &lt;em&gt;Cainan&lt;/em&gt;, Shelah, Eber, Peleg, Reu, Serug, Nahor, Terah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, Perez, Hezron, &lt;em&gt;Arni, Admin&lt;/em&gt;, Amminadab, Nashon, Sala, Boaz, Obed, Jesse, David, &lt;strong&gt;Nathan&lt;/strong&gt;…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew is very much like an Old Testament genealogy that runs from oldest to newest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke follows the style of a Greco-Roman ancestry that runs from newest to oldest – Luke’s order is flipped above to make comparisons easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew is interested in presenting Jesus as the Jewish Messiah, so his genealogy goes back to Abraham the first Jew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke is interested in presenting us the ancestry of the son of Man, so he’s going to go all the way back to Adam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to Abraham, EVERYONE was a “gentile” (if you’ll pardon the anachronism).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke, which was widely circulated in Gentile regions, wanted gentiles to know Jesus is their Messiah too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he stresses in Luke Volume II (the book we know as Acts), he wants us to know Gentiles are included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam to Noah is the same list as Genesis 5, and Shem to Terah, is roughly the same list as Genesis 11:10-25 (see discussion on potential discrepancies below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Gospels are basically the same from Abraham to David (see potential discrepancies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will touch on the women in Matthew’s gospel in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential discrepancies in this section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew omits some names in this section and omits a LOT of names in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener notes this is not unusual for ancient genealogies, and we may have an element of the Holy Spirit blotting out certain names from the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew conspicuously skips three kings of Judah: Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah (compare 1 Chronicles 3:10-16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was interested in preserving 14 generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke inserts someone named “Cainan” inbetween Arphaxhad and Shelah in Abraham’s line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cainan is not mentioned in Genesis 11l&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this is the identical name to the Cainan in Noah’s line, this is possibly a copyist’s error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note this is why we say the Bible is inerrant &lt;strong&gt;in the original manuscripts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several known copyist errors, most notably in John 5:3-4;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These do not detract from the overall inerrancy of Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke inserts Arni and Admin, which are not included in the Old Testament accounts of David’s lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arni is potentially a variant spelling of Ram, we don’t know where Admin came from. Perhaps it’s an &lt;em&gt;admin&lt;/em&gt;istrative error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big thing to note is that Matthew’s list runs through Solomon, the first surviving son of David and the wife of Uriah, while Luke’s runs through Nathan, the second surviving son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note also that Bathsheba is referred to only indirectly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In fact, she is never named in the Bible after she dies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nothing is accidental in the Bible. The Holy Spirit engineers and orchestrates every letter. For her not to be named is a “dis” from the Holy Spirit!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Far from being an innocent victim, perhaps she was the instigator of the entire episode. She did seem to relish her position as Queen Mother in 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Kings 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In contrast, Rahab repented, Tamar was declared righteous by Judah himself, and if you know anything about Ruth and Boaz, there was nothing inappropriate about their relationship.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bad-girls-of-the-bible&#34;&gt;Bad Girls of the Bible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was highly unusual for an ancient genealogy to include women&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All five women listed, including Mary in verse 16, were tainted by scandal (real or suspected).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster posits that by including the first four women, Matthew sought to make any scandal regarding Mary irrelevant to Jesus’ claim to be the Messiah. The ancients held a much wider view of “mother” and “father” than we do today, so if David had a few less than reputable “mothers” in his line and is still regarded as the greatest King of Israel, how much more should Jesus be regarded as one greater than David even though there are some questions regarding His lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tamar&#34;&gt;Tamar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamar relies on the Levirate Marriage law: &lt;sup&gt;Deu 25:5-6&lt;/sup&gt; If brothers dwell together, and one of them dies and has no son, the wife of the dead man shall not be married outside the family to a stranger. Her husband&amp;rsquo;s brother shall go in to her and take her as his wife and perform the duty of a husband&amp;rsquo;s brother to her. And the first son whom she bears shall succeed to the name of his dead brother, that his name may not be blotted out of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamar was the daughter in law of Judah. We can read the complete story in Genesis 38.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She married one of Judah’s sons a guy by the name of Er, but he was wicked and was struck down by the LORD before they had children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In accordance with the law of the Levirate marriage, Judah was REQUIRED to have Tamar marry the next available male, Onan, to marry Tamar and have a child in the name of the deceased son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judah did this but THAT son was also wicked and was struck down (a very R-rated story- the Bible tells it like it is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re getting an idea that maybe Judah was a less than stellar father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judah had a third son, Shelah, but Judah feared He would die along the others, as if it was Tamar who was the bad news causing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judah promised to give Shelah to Tamar but told her to wait until he was older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judah was likely hoping Tamar would go off and find someone else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this is now the Royal line of Judah that is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamar realizes Judah is going to renege on his word so she takes matters into her own hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She KNOWS that Judah’s line must continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She dresses up as a harlot and entices none other than Judah, her father-in-law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judah doesn’t have cash on hand so he leaves his staff, cord and signet ring as a down payment. The next day he goes to collect but Tamar has vanished. He asks around but is told “there is no harlot here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three months later Tamar is showing. When Judah learns of it, he is incensed at the shame she has brough on the family (seriously?) and orders her burned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen 38:24-26&lt;/sup&gt; About three months later Judah was told, “Tamar your daughter-in-law has been immoral. Moreover, she is pregnant by immorality.” And Judah said, “Bring her out, and let her be burned.” As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law, “By the man to whom these belong, I am pregnant.” And she said, “Please identify whose these are, the signet and the cord and the staff.” Then Judah identified them and said, “She is more righteous than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah.” And he did not know her again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says “She is more righteous than I.” which is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamar is untimately proclaimed righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She thwarted the attack on the Royal Line and had twins, Perez and Zerah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see how these seemingly obscure laws in the Torah like the Law of the Levirate Marriage are actually critical to the Lines of David and Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another interesting tidbit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Deu 23:2&lt;/sup&gt; “No one born of a forbidden union may enter the assembly of the LORD. Even to the tenth generation, none of his descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being “righteous” it was still a forbidden union according to the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God apparently means what He says when He says “10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; generation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perez by Tamar, Hezron, Ram, Amminadab, Nahshon, Salmon, Boaz, Obed, Jesse, David – 10 Generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rahab&#34;&gt;Rahab&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Jos 2:12-13&lt;/sup&gt; Now then, please swear to me by the LORD that, as I have dealt kindly with you, you also will deal kindly with my father&amp;rsquo;s house, and give me a sure sign that you will save alive my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and deliver our lives from death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahab was an actual harlot in Jericho who ends up protecting Joshua’s men in exchange for protection. You can read the story in Joshua 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tradition holds that she repented and found grace and mercy by following the God of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t say that Grace and Mercy are New Testament concepts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is lauded in the Hebrews 11 Hall of faith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Heb 11:31** **&lt;/sup&gt;By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had given a friendly welcome to the spies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ruth&#34;&gt;Ruth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruth relies on the Kinsman Redeemer Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Lev 25:25&lt;/sup&gt; “If your brother becomes poor and sells part of his property, then his nearest redeemer shall come and redeem what his brother has sold.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the passage that causes many to associate Ruth with scandal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rth 3:7-9&lt;/sup&gt; And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then she came softly and uncovered his feet and lay down. At midnight the man was startled and turned over, and behold, a woman lay at his feet! He said, “Who are you?” And she answered, “I am Ruth, your servant (handmaid). Spread your wings over your servant, for you are a redeemer.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know anything about Ruth and Boaz, you know it was unlikely there was any mischief before marriage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ruth 3, she “uncovers his feet”, which to be fair, in the Bible is often a euphemism for other things and then asks him to “spread your wing or hem/skirt over me (same wing and hem/corner are the same word in Hebrew). Her request was scandalous but not for the reason you may be thinking. As chuck Missler says, “she wasn’t propositioning him, it’s far worse than that. She was asking for his protection. In other words, she was asking him to make good on his duty to be a kinsman redeemer – another Old Testament law that turns out to be critically important to Jesus’ lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scandal part is that Moabites were the sworn enemies of Israel and Boaz was forbidden by law from marrying ruth, but he must make an exception (and I suspect he did so gladly) because of the overriding law of the Kinsman redeemer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that is important to know about the application of Jewish law. Whenever there is a negative commandment that conflicts with a positive one, the positive one wins out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is going to make use of this guideline frequently, particularly with the so-called Sabbath controversies. He’s not overriding the law; he’s following the law strictly and perfectly, much more perfectly than the prevailing attitudes of the day were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case the law said an Israelite was forbidden from marrying a moabitie but the positive command required the nearer kinsman to redeem.Ruth who earlier made the famous proclamation of “where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God my God.” (Ruth 1:16) now says “I am your servant or some translations say handmaid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Luk 1:38&lt;/sup&gt; And Mary said, “Behold, I am the servant (handmaid) of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mary’s words in Luke 1:38 echo ruth’s faithfulness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in Biblical typology Boaz is a type of Jesus and Ruth, a gentile is a picture of us, the gentile church. We are helpless and poor without our Redeemer. With Jesus we are royalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mary&#34;&gt;Mary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve talked and will talk a lot more about her righteousness but this doesn’t keep detractors from raising the appearance of scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Joseph appears initially ready to believe the scandal (not without reason of course)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mat 1:18-19&lt;/sup&gt; Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. [19] And her husband Joseph, being a just man and &lt;strong&gt;unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that Jesus’ questionable lineage was used by His detractors in John 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Joh 8:18-19&lt;/sup&gt; I am the one who bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about me.” [19] They said to him therefore, &lt;strong&gt;“Where is your Father?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although I just said to give others the benefit of the doubt, we can tell by the context of the passage that they are being absolutely nasty here!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psalms appear to speak of Jesus’ childhood struggles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Psa 69:8-12&lt;/sup&gt; I have become a &lt;strong&gt;stranger to my brothers, an alien to my mother&amp;rsquo;s sons&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;For zeal for your house has consumed me&lt;/em&gt;, and the reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me. When I wept and humbled my soul with fasting, it became my reproach. When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them. &lt;strong&gt;I am the talk of those who sit in the gate, and the drunkards make songs about me&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s hard to imagine growing up and having Jesus as a half-brother. I’m sure James, Jude and the others were none too thrilled at being told “why can’t you be more like Yeshua?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-wife-of-uriah-bathsheba&#34;&gt;The wife of Uriah (Bathsheba)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:3.77014in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a familiar story but 2 Samuel 11 says it was the time when the Kings should have been on the battlefield but David stayed back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He eyes Bathsheba bathing and the rest as they say his history&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2Sa 11:4-5&lt;/sup&gt; So David sent messengers and took her, and she came to him, and he lay with her. (Now she had been purifying herself from her uncleanness.) Then she returned to her house. And the woman conceived, and she sent and told David, “I am pregnant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He next tries to cover up by having Uriah lay with his wife, which he refused to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The army (again, where David SHOULD have been) was supposed to be in a state of ritual purity, specifically abstaining from marital relations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David then has Uriah eliminated so he can openly marry his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great example of the difference between the “vertical” and the “horizontal” realms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the vertical- our relationship with God– David repented and was forgiven. In acts 13, David is still referred to as a man after God’s own heart and Psalm 51 is a beautiful expression of repentence and forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horizontally – our relationship with others - there are still consequences when we sin. This episode resulted in David’s family life becoming an absolute train-wreck&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture above is inside the same archaeological park we talked about with David’s harp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists think David’s palace was at the top, and you can see how steep the incline is with the houses below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would have been quite easy for the king to walk out and look down into the houses below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some speculation as to whether this was a sexual assault by David. I tend not to see this and we get a clue why in Matthew 1:6. Notice Bathsheba is not named.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact she is NEVER named in the Bible after she dies, and only once during the episode in question is she named as “Bathsheba”, otherwise it’s the “wife of Uriah” or some other pronoun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some scholars see this as a “dis” from the Holy Spirit which to me suggests she knew exactly what she was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew continues this trend of not uttering her name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the other four women who are named either engaged in or had the appearance of scandal only without doing anything wrong. The contrast suggests to some commentators that Bathsheba never repented of her role in all of the drama. That is a speculation but we can see in 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Kings 2, Bathsheba seems to relish her power and position as the Queen Mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet through it all, God orchestrated the messianic line through the sons of David and Bathsheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

After the deportation, Jeconiah, Shealtiel, Zerubbabel, Abiud, Eliakim, Azor, Zadok, Achim, Eliud, Eleazar, Matthan, &lt;strong&gt;Jacob&lt;/strong&gt; the father of Joseph the &lt;strong&gt;husband&lt;/strong&gt; of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Messiah.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;↓ &lt;sup&gt;Luke 3:23&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age, being &lt;del&gt;the&lt;/del&gt; son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew goes from Solomon through Jacob&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He clearly says Joseph is the husband of Mary of whom Jesus was born; he does not say Joseph is the father of Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke goes from Nathan through Heli&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In everyday language, the fact that Luke adds, “as was supposed” implies that Jesus is not actually the son of Joseph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the original Greek, there is no “the” before “son (supposed) of Joseph”, which further distinguishes Joseph from Jesus’ direct ancestors. “By the omission of the article, Joseph’s name is separated from the genealogical chain and accorded a place of its own” (&lt;em&gt;Rienecker&lt;/em&gt; as cited in Stern’s commentary).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler and other commentators see far more going on with the word ενομιζετο, which has as its root &lt;em&gt;nomos&lt;/em&gt;, meaning “law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They speculate that there was a legal adoption (relying completely on the Torah’s rulings) of Jesus by Joseph which gives Jesus claim to the Davidic line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other potential discrepancies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall Luke has 76 names while Matthew has 41 names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew omits Ahaziah, Joash and Amaziah (compare 1 Chronicles 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought is they were so bad they were blotted out according to Deuteronomy 29:20 -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deu 29:20 The LORD will not be willing to forgive him, and the LORD will blot out his name from under heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, Keener notes that omitting some names is not unexpected with ancient genealogies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I’ve said before, of all the Gospel writers Luke is the one most interested in chronology. Matthew is more interested in symbolism and the number 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew’s math doesn’t add up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t get from 586, the main deportation to Babylon and the destruction of Jerusalm to 5 BC and the birth of Jesus with only 14 generations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew lists Jeconiah twice and counts him in both groups of 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler suggests a copyists error with the second Jeconiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last two kings before the deportation were Jehoakim, the direct descendant of Josiah and Jehoiachin, called Jeconiah or Coniah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke and Matthew apparently have some overlap in the lines with Shealtiel and Zerubabbel or it could be just a coincidence with the same names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-deportation-to-babylon&#34;&gt;The deportation to Babylon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:3.92857in;height:2.84318in&#34; alt=&#34;C:\Pictorial Library of Bible Lands\Israel Museums\Tower of David Museum, Jerusalem\Babylonian exile imaginative depiction, tb042403502.jpg&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Babylon” is a recurring theme in the Bible, particularly the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BCE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern mural depicts Israel’s deportation to Babylon. The words in the upper right say “Galut Bavel,” Exile (to) Babylon&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to place ourselves in the shoes of the Jews of that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve been promised that you’re God’s people through the Mosaic Covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve been promised the land forever through the Abrahamic Covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve been promised that David’s throne will endure forever through the Davidic Covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerusalem was thought to be impregnable, particularly after the Assyrians failed (2 Kings 19:31-36).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet all that is lost on the 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of Av in -586.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had God’s promises failed? Maybe He’s not really all-powerful or all-good. Maybe we sinned. bad that we’re now beyond His reach. Maybe we misread the promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the question many ask today in the face of tragedy or evil is, “How could a good God let this happen?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then what do you do next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sing the blues (Lamentations)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn your back on God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reinvent/reapply/spiritualize the Bible passages pertaining to the promises&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fall on your knees in repentance and draw near to God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we do today, the people back then did all those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as Gettysburg, Pearl Harbor, the JFK assassination, or 9/11 is are those critical moments in history for Americans, the Babylonian captivity is such a moment for Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And a few years later in 70 CE, another such moment will occur: the Roman destruction of Jerusalem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jeconiah&#34;&gt;Jeconiah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew includes Jeconiah in the Royal Line of Messiah, but there’s a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jeremiah 22, God is so fed up with Jeconiah, he puts a curse on him AND his offspring, saying no offspring of his will ever rule in Judah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Jeconiah is in the Line of Jesus. So how can Jesus rule as King Messiah if that very same Royal Line is cursed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chuck Missler says, we can imagine Satan and his demons rejoicing in the halls of hell – they finally polluted the royal line and prevented Messiah. All those attacks on the royal line from Adam and Eve, to Cain and Abel, to Judah and Tamar to David and Bathsheba, to the countless other times Satan tried to wipe out the line, finally worked! We’ve finally prevented the Messiah from ruling!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we need to imagine God turning to the Angels and saying “Watch what I do next!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the fine print! No OFFSPRING of Jeconiah’s shall sit on the Throne of David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image5.png&#34; style=&#34;width:3.95053in;height:3.9826in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s put this all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we note that this is only a speculation, but it’s the one that appears to be held by most (but not all) Protestant commentators, though it’s not without its complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion is Matthew is presenting Joseph’s Genealogy and Luke is giving us Mary’s line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presents Jesus as the Jewish King/Messiah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genealogy begins with Abraham, the father of the Jewish people,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;presents the Legal/Royal Line through Joseph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his gospel, Matthew focuses much more on Joseph than on Mary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE VIRGIN BIRTH directly circumvents the blood curse on Jeconiah, yet through an adoption procedure (hinted at by the word enomiZETo), Jesus has every right to David’s Royal Line JUST AS IF he were Joseph’s natural son&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the “HOUSE OF DAVID”, the Royal line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the virgin birth also avoids the original sin that happens anytime a human x and a human y chromosome merge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presents Jesus as the perfect man/last Adam/savior of all humanity,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genealogy begins with Adam, the first man,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enomiZETO suggests Joseph adopted Jesus (or potentially some other similar adoption leveraging either the Daughters of Zelophehad (Numbers 27) or the Levirate Marriage (Deut 25) rulings in the Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presents the Blood line through Mary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his gospel, Luke focuses much more on Mary than on Joseph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the LINEAGE OF DAVID, the blood line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Joseph is both of the House and Lineage of David (Luke 2:4), he contains the curse of Jeconiah and can never rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is also both of the House and Lineage of David, but He does NOT contain the curse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why the Virgin Birth is more than a simple sign of the Messiah, it is critical to Jesus’ claim to be the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-reconciliation-theories&#34;&gt;Other Reconciliation theories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, as Stern points out “The Genealogies of both Matthew and Luke employ unusual language in connection with Yeshua/Jesus and with good reason. Both assert Yeshua had no human father in the ordinary sense of the word but that the virgin Mary was caused to bear Him by the holy spirit in a supernatural way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other suggestions over the years (some with very strong traditional support) include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that Jeconiah repented so the need to circumvent the blood curse is null and void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commentaries note that Jeconiah was NOT “Childless” as the Bible records his offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a counter-argument, we would say that none of those children reigned as KING of Judah. Some were lower-level administrators of the region but that’s not the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the line of David continued, but his descendants no longer possessed the throne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew is Mary’s line by birth through Solomon and Luke is Joseph’s through Nathan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matthew directly mentions Mary and the other women, while Luke does not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph’s father Jacob died, and Heli was his adopted father prior to Mary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heli died and his widow remarried Jacob&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew and Luke recorded the same genealogy differently because they had different sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes either Matthew or Luke in error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This commentator would reject that premise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skeptic would say, “See? The Bible is full of contradictions and can’t be trusted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our opinion this is an intellectually dishonest answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless a witness gives us a reason to think they are lying or delusional, we give them the benefit of the doubt that what they are recounting is the truth as they see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOWEVER God choose to authenticate Jesus’ claim to be the Messiah, we’re very thankful He did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Heb 11:6&lt;/sup&gt; And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that &lt;strong&gt;He rewards those who (diligently) seek Him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Tit 3:9&lt;/sup&gt; But &lt;strong&gt;avoid foolish controversies, genealogies&lt;/strong&gt;, dissensions, and quarrels about the law, for they are &lt;strong&gt;unprofitable and worthless&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us strive to be diligent seekers but not engage in foolish and worthless controversies!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;matthew-112-17-jeconiah-to-jesus&#34;&gt;Matthew 1:12-17: Jeconiah to Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And after the deportation to Babylon: Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel, and Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, and Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor, and Azor the father of Zadok, and Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud, and Eliud the father of Eleazar, and Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ. . all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a problem with Jeconiah, which we’ll discuss after we look at Luke’s genealogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew demonstrates that the line of David continued through Jesus even though David’s descendants no longer possessed the throne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The math doesn’t work – you can’t get 14 generations from -586 to -5, the time of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more puzzling is Matthew has to count Jeconiah twice to get 14 from David to Babylon and also from Babylon to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous theories have emerged such as counting Joseph and Mary separately, but these are all speculation and not really pertinent to our purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew is more interested in the pattern of 14, which someone with a Hebraic mindset would have noticed right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew spelling of David adds up to 14:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ד&lt;/span&gt; = D = 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ו&lt;/span&gt; = V = 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ד&lt;/span&gt; = D = 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4+6+4 = 14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another prominent theory is based on the moon phases and their connection to the House of David:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 89:35-37 Once for all I have sworn by my holiness; I will not lie to David. His offspring shall endure forever, his throne as long as the sun before me. &lt;strong&gt;Like the moon, it shall be established forever, a faithful witness in the skies&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron Eby speculates that the original audience would have noted the roughly 14 days from New Moon to Full Moon, darkness to light (Abraham to David) and then the roughly 14 days from Full Moon to New Moon, light to darkness (David to Jeconiah and the deportation), with the dark to light pattern repeated from Jeconiah to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew is clearly establishing a link to David and that Yeshua is the rightful descendant of David’s royal line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-323-30&#34;&gt;Luke 3:23-30&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph, the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai, the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda, the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri, the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er, the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim, the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek genealogies were often reverse chronological&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase “as was supposed” has puzzled scholars&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek word is a variation of nomitzo, which can mean “reckoned as by law” (&lt;em&gt;nomos&lt;/em&gt; = law).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One theory is that Luke is communicating Jesus is not the natural son of Joseph but an adopted son, just like adoptive parents go through a legal process today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we would call Eli the “father in law” of Joseph, but that type of terminology likely didn’t exist in 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century Judaism. According to this interpretation, Eli is Mary’s father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus a common interpretation is that Matthew is giving us the &lt;strong&gt;royal&lt;/strong&gt; line of Jesus through David and Solomon, while Luke is giving us the &lt;strong&gt;blood&lt;/strong&gt; line of Jesus through David and Nathan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus can be said that Jesus is of the house** (royal) and &lt;strong&gt;lineage&lt;/strong&gt; (blood) of David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about Jeconiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jeconiah-and-the-blood-curse&#34;&gt;Jeconiah and the blood curse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jer 22:24-30 “As I live, declares the LORD, though Coniah (i.e. Jeconiah) the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were the signet ring on my right hand, yet I would tear you off [25] and give you into the hand of those who seek your life, into the hand of those of whom you are afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans. [26] I will hurl you and the mother who bore you into another country, where you were not born, and there you shall die. [27] But to the land to which they will long to return, there they shall not return.” [28] Is this man Coniah a despised, broken pot, a vessel no one cares for? Why are he and his children hurled and cast into a land that they do not know? [29] O land, land, land, hear the word of the LORD! [30] Thus says the LORD: “Write this man down as childless, a man who shall not succeed in his days, for none of his offspring shall succeed in sitting on the throne of David and ruling again in Judah.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the promise made to David, Jeconiah was apparently so evil that God pronounced a curse on his line in verse 30: “none of his offspring shall succeed in sitting on the throne of David and ruling again in Judah.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have a problem. The Messiah is supposed to come from David’s royal line yet God just pronounced a blood curse on that line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can imagine Satan and his demons rejoicing, thinking God boxed Himself into a corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we can imagine God saying, “watch what I do next!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leading conjecture is that Matthew establishes Joseph as the &lt;strong&gt;legal father&lt;/strong&gt; through his marriage to Mary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, Jesus is legally entitled to be in David’s Royal line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Jesus is not Joseph’s biological son, Jesus does not carry the blood curse of Jeconiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke establishes Jesus as being from the non-cursed blood line to David through Nathan and Mary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In other words, The ONLY way around the curse is through a virgin birth and adoption.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that doesn’t make you go “wow” you’ve either heard the story before, or you weren’t paying attention!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other conjectures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some scholars reverse this and say Matthew is Mary’s and Luke’s is Joseph. If so, a problem is that Mary is in Jeconiah’s line and would carry the blood curse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that Jeconiah repented and God accepted his contrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus it is later written that Jeconiah had offspring who ruled Judea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The counter argument to this is they were local govenors of Judah under Persian rule, they were not monarchs. &lt;em&gt;The line of David may have continued, continued but his descendants no longer possessed the throne.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Study: The Samaritans

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/T4iBXTQ_Lfo&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of Jesus&amp;rsquo; most famous encounters involve Samaritans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first in John 4 is His discussion with the Samaritan woman at Jacob&amp;rsquo;s well, where, among other things, Jesus correct the Samaritan misconception about the God they are worshipping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second is in Luke 10.  This one isn&amp;rsquo;t directed &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; a Samaritan, but it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; a Samaritan.  A Torah scholar wants to know how far he needs to take this &amp;ldquo;love your neighbor&amp;rdquo; thing.  Again, Jesus corrected his thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the Samaritan woman and the Jewish man had strayed off course.  We run the same risk, if we don&amp;rsquo;t let Jesus correct our courses.  Let&amp;rsquo;s explore the backround of the Samaritans and see what they can teach us about staying on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;
Synopsis - Eve gives birth to two sons, Cain and Abel. Cain quarrels with Abel and murders him, and becomes a rootless wanderer with wicked descendants. A third son, Seth, is born to Adam. Enoch, the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; from Adam walked with God, then was taken up without dying. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/246609/jewish/The-Story-of-Noah-and-the-Ark-in-the-Bible.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the tenth from Adam, is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chabad.org/multimedia/video_cdo/aid/4633395/jewish/Was-Noah-Truly-Righteous.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the only righteous man&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in a corrupt world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;genesis-4&#34;&gt;Genesis 4&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-41-5-the-birth-of-cain-and-abel&#34;&gt;Genesis 4:1-5 THE BIRTH OF CAIN AND ABEL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, “I have gotten a man with the help of the LORD.” And again, she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a worker of the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground, and Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering, but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his face fell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam and Eve believed Cain was the promised seed of the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course he forfeited any hope of this by his unholy actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it like us to expect prophecy to be fulfilled in our day and age?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until this point, no offerings were documented as being required, although there could have been such a requirement that wasn’t written down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is reasonable to assume this is not the first time they offered something – at some point, they must have been taught the right way and the wrong way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that Adam went to Jerusalem after being banished from the Garden and built the first altar on Mount Moriah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, tradition says that all of this took place on Mount Moriah, the place we know today as the Temple Mount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First documented religious service; first competition; first murder. These three things are interconnected. When the irreligious see the bad behavior of believers, they naturally want no part of it.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been said that Christianity is not a religion, it’s a relationship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A personal relationship with God and Jesus – Deuteronomy 6:5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A personal commitment to love our neighbors as ourselves – Leviticus 19:18&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abel accepted and Cain rejected&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it because Cain didn’t offer blood?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. This may be an example of Christians knowing just enough about the Levitical sacrificial system to be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both grain and meat offerings are later commanded by God, and the Torah explicitly allows a person to bring a grain offering instead of an animal sacrifice for a sin offering.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the word used in Genesis 4:3-5 is &lt;em&gt;mincha&lt;/em&gt;, which is most closely associated with the grain offering in Leviticus 2.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cain’s occupation was a worker of the ground – he would be expected to bring an offering from the produce grown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tithe in dollars not pounds, because my income is in dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone in England would not be expected to tithe in dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the position that Abel’s meat offering was favored solely because it was a meat offering may have some typological merit in that foreshadows Jesus’ sacrifice, but it has little basis in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should always let the Bible be our first go-to reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Apostolic writings often provide more detail than we are given in the Hebrew Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this situation, John and the writer to the Hebrews tell us exactly why Cain’s offering was rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heb 11:4 By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, through which he was commended as righteous, God commending him by accepting his gifts. And through his faith, though he died, he still speaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Jn 3:12 We should not be like Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother&amp;rsquo;s righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biblical answer to why Abel’s sacrifice was accepted Is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abel’s offering was accepted because he was a righteous person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cain’s offering was rejected because he was a wicked person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, we can reasonably conclude that Cain had something in his heart that polluted his gift to God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 29:13 And the Lord said: “Because this people draw near with their mouth and honor me with their lips, while their hearts are far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment taught by men,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God would rather not have any offering than one made with a polluted heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the same with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 5:23-24 “So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First, be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t required to bring any offers, such as a tithe, but if we do we should never do it begrudgingly or if we are holding a grudge against someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus makes this point in Matthew 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scary thing is we aren’t told whether our gifts are accepted or not. Sure, the church cashes our checks but that’s not the same thing as an offering pleasing to God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this same sermon, Jesus also teaches in Matthew six that if we don’t give in secret, then any accolades we receive from men may be our reward. So the end of year tax deduction letter I get may not accrue any reward in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say, God looks at the heart as He says in 1 Samuel 16. Our offering is just what man sees. The heart was the difference between Cain’s offering and Abel&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-46-7-god-give-cain-a-second-chance&#34;&gt;Genesis 4:6-7 GOD GIVE CAIN A SECOND CHANCE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Cain, “Why are you angry, and why has your face fallen? If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is contrary to you, but you must rule over it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-48-15-cain-murders-abel&#34;&gt;Genesis 4:8-15 CAIN MURDERS ABEL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cain spoke to Abel his brother. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD said to Cain, “Where is Abel your brother?” He said, “I do not know; am I my brother&amp;rsquo;s keeper?” And the LORD said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother&amp;rsquo;s blood is crying to me from the ground. And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother&amp;rsquo;s blood from your hand. When you work the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.” Cain said to the LORD, “My punishment is greater than I can bear. Behold, you have driven me today away from the ground, and from your face I shall be hidden. I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.” Then the LORD said to him, “Not so! If anyone kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.” And the LORD put a mark on Cain, lest any who found him should attack him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do well&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above conclusion that Abel’s gift was accepted because he was a good person presents a problem if our “New Testament” theology holds that “all our righteousness was as filthy rags and we can’t bring any good work before the Lord.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches that our works matter – here God is imploring Cain to repent and do good deeds if he wants to be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not just an “Old Testament” teaching because, as we’ve just seen, the Apostolic authors affirm it, as does Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note also that Hebrew says Abel was righteous by faith (Heb 11:4 By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you may be asking which is it? By faith, or by works? The answer is “yes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is no difficulty here. Abel’s deeds were righteous because he was a man of faith.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have faith, we should be displaying good works. We don’t do good works to get saved; we do good works because we are saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sin croucheth at the door&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note immediately after the promise of a Messiah from Eve in Genesis 3:15, there is an immediate satanic attack on Eve’s firstborn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s warning to Cain went ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have an enemy who tempts us to sin but we must rule over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the moment-by-moment choice to sin or not to sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cain angry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 5:21-22 “You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.’ [22] But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the hell of fire. So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cain committed the murder in his heart in verse 5 and with his hands in verse 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abel as first martyr&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mat 23:34-35 (Luke 11:49-51) Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from town to town, [35] so that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No words of Abel are documented&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was he killed strictly because of his right standing position with the Lord?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So within a few minutes, his good deeds were earning him favor with God and those good deeds would also get him martyred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there someone else who was killed for who He was without opening His mouth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In opposition to “name it and claim it,” Jesus promises us the same kind of tribulation and hatred by the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense, if the world doesn’t hate us, we might be doing something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blood speaks out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 6:10 They cried out with a loud voice, “O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before you will judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heb 12:24 and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that Abel’s soul still speaks condemning every murder and every time an innocent drop of blood is shed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a lot more going on with our blood than we realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tradition also says that Cain’s “fugitive and wandering” soul has no rest.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark of Cain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, there were now more than three people living since Cain is worried about a relative of Abel acting as the “Avenger of blood.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t know what the mark was – it was unlikely to be a tatoo or some type of mutilation since both of these are later prohibited in the Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word is “ot” which means a literal or figurative sign (and is even the word for “letter” as in “a”, “b”, “c”…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah’s rainbow is another “ot” (Gen 9:12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s words are to be an “ot” on the right hand and they shall be as frontlets between the eyes (Deut 6:8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the “sign” could simply be a promise from God, who knows the end from the beginning, that Cain was not to be touched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In His Dust&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cain’s sin had long-term consequences. In Jewish thought if you kill a life, you have killed a generation. If being evil has severe negative consequences in this life, how much more is the opposite true? How much more will our righteous acts be a blessing to others in this life as well as be credited as “gold silver and precious stones” in the next! If we teach a young person to follow Yeshua and take his or her Bible seriously, we are impacting not only that person’s life but who knows how many people in future generations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-416-24-the-children-of-cain-and-a-godless-civilization&#34;&gt;Genesis 4:16-24 THE CHILDREN OF CAIN AND A GODLESS CIVILIZATION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Cain went away from the presence of the LORD and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden. Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he built a city, he called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch. To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech. And Lamech took two wives. The name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock. His brother&amp;rsquo;s name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe. Zillah also bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah. Lamech said to his wives: “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, listen to what I say: I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me. If Cain&amp;rsquo;s revenge is sevenfold, then Lamech&amp;rsquo;s is seventy-sevenfold.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enoch and Lamech – Cain’s descendants Enoch and Lamech are not the same as the Enoch and Lamech in Seth’s line in Genesis 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common “newbie” question is “where did Cain get his wife?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is in Genesis 5:4, “The days of Adam after he fathered Seth were 800 years; and he had other sons and daughters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 930 years, Adam and Eve could have had a lot of kids, and they would have had a lot of kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cain married his sister or his niece – there really was no other option at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the first mention of polygamy and it’s very much in a negative context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamech was a bad dude and he is recorded as being the first polygamist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical reasons for polygamy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women may have outnumbered men&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don’t know this, but it wouldn’t be surprising given what was likely a high rate of maternal as well as infant mortality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polygamy resulted in being fruitful and multiplying the earth faster than monogamous relationships would have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More workers allowed farming and hunting efforts to be more productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But God clearly said “TWO shall become one flesh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is wrong to use our circumstances around us as a rationale to violate God’s commands, which is what Lamech and the Biblical polygamists (including the venerated patriarchs) did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple partners led to big trouble for Abraham and Jacob!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears Cain’s line is bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition hold that Lamech killed Tubal-cain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feinberg notes the contrast between the detail we get of Seth’s line in Genesis five with the rather limited detail of Cain’s line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t told explicitly but it’s a reasonable inference that Cain’s line was wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jude refers to the “way of Cain”: Jud 1:11 Woe to them! For they walked in the way of Cain and abandoned themselves for the sake of gain to Balaam&amp;rsquo;s error and perished in Korah&amp;rsquo;s rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do know that everyone apart from Noah was evil and the world was not a good place to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen 6:5 The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamech’s sons were pioneers in the areas of technology and the arts, and apparently were celebrated for their achievements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t told anything to the effect of these kids not walking in the ways of their father, so we can conclude that Lamech did not raise his sons to know the Lord and that they used their talents for self-serving purposes, turning their back on the one in whose Image they were created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We too are blessed with diverse talents, skills, and creative abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we using these for our own glory or for his?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Godless progress is not progress.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventy times seven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s safe to say, Lamech had “an overdeveloped sense of vengeance. It’s going to get (him) into trouble one day.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn’t hesitate to murder at the slightest offense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin to see how bad the days of Genesis 6:5 were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster writes, “Jesus corrects Lamech’s sadistic mathematics by turning the same equation around and applying it to forgiveness.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 18:21-22 Then Peter came up and said to him, “Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?” [22] Jesus said to him, “I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time we are injured or offended, we should remember Lamech’s position and then immediately substitute that with Jesus’ instruction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-425-26-the-birth-of-seth&#34;&gt;Genesis 4:25-26 THE BIRTH OF SETH&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Seth, for she said, “God has appointed for me another offspring instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. At that time people began to call upon the name of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Appointed”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve, no doubt still hopeful that her direct offspring would be the promised Messiah named Abel’s replacement “Seth”, which in Hebrew is &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;שׁת&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is linguistically connected to Genesis 3:15: &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אשׁית&lt;/span&gt; = “I will put” or “I will appoint”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve hoped that Seth would be the appointed Messiah who would come to correct the evil state the world was in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:3 tells us that Adam was 130 when Seth was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, a lot of bad stuff happened in those 130 years and in the remaining 800 years of Adam’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine knowing Eden and now seeing the thoughts and deeds of his offspring focused on “only evil all the day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enosh means man but in the sense of mortal man, not in the sense of Adam, mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Call upon the name of the Lord”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many Hebrew verbs, the word here for “call”, Qara, can have a wide range of meanings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have this in English too. Calling by name has a very different meaning than “name-calling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unnuanced reading might suggest men who had previously forgotten about God now began to invoke His name once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other scholars note man’s general descent into evil and would read this as “men began to &lt;em&gt;profane&lt;/em&gt; the name of the LORD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-51-20-adams-genealogy&#34;&gt;Genesis 5:1-20 Adam’s Genealogy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the book of the generations of Adam. When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God. Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them Man when they were created. When Adam had lived 130 years, he fathered a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth. The days of Adam after he fathered Seth were 800 years; and he had other sons and daughters. Thus all the days that Adam lived were 930 years, and he died. When Seth had lived 105 years, he fathered Enosh. Seth lived after he fathered Enosh 807 years and had other sons and daughters. Thus all the days of Seth were 912 years, and he died. When Enosh had lived 90 years, he fathered Kenan. Enosh lived after he fathered Kenan 815 years and had other sons and daughters. Thus all the days of Enosh were 905 years, and he died. When Kenan had lived 70 years, he fathered Mahalalel. Kenan lived after he fathered Mahalalel 840 years and had other sons and daughters. Thus all the days of Kenan were 910 years, and he died. When Mahalalel had lived 65 years, he fathered Jared. Mahalalel lived after he fathered Jared 830 years and had other sons and daughters. Thus all the days of Mahalalel were 895 years, and he died. When Jared had lived 162 years, he fathered Enoch. Jared lived after he fathered Enoch 800 years and had other sons and daughters. Thus all the days of Jared were 962 years, and he died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Genealogy in Matthew begins identical to Genesis 5:1 and Jesus’ genealogy in Luke is identical to Genesis 5 (Luke goes in descending order)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 1:1 (KJV) The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luk 3:36-38 the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan, the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition regarding Adam says he died in Jerusalem and was buried on Mt. Moriah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-521-24-mysterious-enoch&#34;&gt;Genesis 5:21-24 Mysterious Enoch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Enoch had lived 65 years, he fathered Methuselah. Enoch walked with God after he fathered Methuselah 300 years and had other sons and daughters. Thus all the days of Enoch were 365 years. Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Genesis 5, Enoch is only mentioned one other time in the Hebrew Bible (1 Chr 1:3 as part of a Genealogy), but by virtue of his mysterious ending, he is the subject of a large body of work in Jewish mysticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He might be largely forgotten about by Christians were it not for two mentions, one in Hebrews and one in Jude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heb 11:5-6 By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God. [6] And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Septuagint uses the Greek word for “pleasing” in Genesis 5:24 where it says “walked with God.” In greek the thought is “Enoch was pleasing to God.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does the Book of Revelation bear a striking resemblance to the book of 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Enoch, Jude directly quotes from 1 Enoch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jud 1:14-16 It was also about these that Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, “Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his holy ones, to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all their deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him” (quoting 1 Enoch 1:9). These are grumblers, malcontents, following their own sinful desires; they are loud-mouthed boasters, showing favoritism to gain advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early believers expected Enoch and Elijah to return prior to the second coming of the Messiah.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early church father Tertullian wrote, “Enoch was translated and so was Elijah. They did not experience death; it was postponed, and only temporarily. They are most certainly preserved for the purpose of suffering of death so that, by their blood, they may extinguish Antichrist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Tertullian and others suggest that Enoch and Elijah are the two witnesses of Revelation 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 11:3-5 And I will grant authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.” These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth. And if anyone would harm them, fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes. If anyone would harm them, this is how he is doomed to be killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish Midrash states that Enoch was a shoemaker (perhaps because of all the walking with God he did).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the evil world around him, Enoch stitched each shoe with care and perfection in order to give his customers pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, “his main motivation was to help others rather than merely to sell shoes for a living.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that his heart was 100% on God, but that did not detract from his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No matter how mundane one’s vocation may be, it can be elevated by keeping in mind that one is helping others.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-525-32-enoch-to-noah&#34;&gt;Genesis 5:25-32 Enoch to Noah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Methuselah had lived 187 years, he fathered Lamech. Methuselah lived after he fathered Lamech 782 years and had other sons and daughters. Thus all the days of Methuselah were 969 years, and he died. When Lamech had lived 182 years, he fathered a son and called his name Noah, saying, “Out of the ground that the LORD has cursed, this one shall bring us relief from our work and from the painful toil of our hands.” Lamech lived after he fathered Noah 595 years and had other sons and daughters. Thus all the days of Lamech were 777 years, and he died. After Noah was 500 years old, Noah fathered Shem, Ham, and Japheth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, they knew Noah was going to be a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A boat captain wasn’t on their radar, so they naturally assumed he might be the messiah who will set things straight and remove the curse of painful toil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methuselah had the longest recorded life of anyone in the Bible – 969 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His name means “his death sends” or “his death brings” – Mot is death and selach means to send.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we do the math, we see the Flood came in the very year Methuselah died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus his name is a prophecy – his death shall bring the judgment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that he has the longest life also suggests God’s mercy –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Pe 3:9 The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grace – getting what you don’t deserve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercy – not getting what you DO deserve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we shall see in chapter 6, God’s mercy does not last indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gospel-message-in-hebrew&#34;&gt;The Gospel Message in Hebrew&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name Approximate Meaning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam - Man&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seth - is appointed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enosh - A (mortal) man of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cainan - sorrow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mahalalel - The Glory of God/the blessed God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jared - shall come down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enoch - instructing/teaching&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methuselah - his death shall bring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamech - those sinking down in despair&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah - comfort/rest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOSPEL MESSAGE &amp;ldquo;HIDDEN&amp;rdquo; IN GENESIS 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Man is appointed mortal sorrow, but the blessed God shall come down teaching that His death shall bring the despairing comfort and rest.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

His head and hair were as white as snow-white wool, his eyes like a fiery flame, 15. his feet like burnished brass refined in a furnace, and his voice like the sound of rushing waters. 16. In his right hand he held seven stars, out of his mouth went a sharp double-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in full strength. 17. When I saw him, I fell down at his feet like a dead man. He placed his right hand upon me and said, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid! I am the First and the Last, 18. the Living One. I was dead, but look!—I am alive forever and ever! And I hold the keys to Death and Sh&amp;rsquo;ol. 19. So write down what you see, both what is now, and what will happen afterward. 20. Here is the secret meaning of the seven stars you saw in my right hand, and of the seven gold menorahs: the seven stars are the angels of the seven Messianic communities, and the seven menorahs are the seven Messianic communities.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The so-called &amp;ldquo;Vision of the Risen Christ&amp;rdquo; in Revelation 1:12-18 has several similarities (and key differences) with Daniel 7 and Daniel 10. It is beneficial to read the Daniel passages before we begin a verse-by-verse study of the remainder of Revelation 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Daniel passages, focus on the depictions of the &amp;ldquo;Ancient of Days&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Son of Man&amp;rdquo; in Daniel 7:9-14, and then the description of the unnamed angel in Daniel 10:5-10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-2&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;(1) In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head as he lay in his bed. Then he wrote down the dream and told the sum of the matter. (2) Daniel declared, &amp;ldquo;I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea. (3) And four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another. (4) The first was like a lion and had eagles&amp;rsquo; wings. Then as I looked its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and the mind of a man was given to it. (5) And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side. It had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, &amp;lsquo;Arise, devour much flesh.&amp;rsquo; (6) After this I looked, and behold, another, like a leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back. And the beast had four heads, and dominion was given to it. (7) After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns. (8) I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them &lt;mark&gt;another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(9) &amp;ldquo;As I looked, thrones were placed, and the &lt;mark&gt;Ancient of Days took his seat&lt;/mark&gt;; his &lt;mark&gt;clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool&lt;/mark&gt;; his throne was fiery flames; its wheels were burning fire. (10) A stream of fire issued and came out from before him; a thousand thousands served him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the court sat in judgment, and the books were opened. (11) &amp;ldquo;I looked then because of the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking. And as I looked, the beast was killed, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire. (12) As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time. (13) &amp;ldquo;I saw in the night visions, and behold, &lt;mark&gt;with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man&lt;/mark&gt;, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. (14) And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed. (15) &amp;ldquo;As for me, Daniel, my spirit within me was anxious, and the visions of my head alarmed me. (16) I approached one of those who stood there and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of the things.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(17) &amp;lsquo;These four great beasts are four kings who shall arise out of the earth. (18) But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, forever and ever.&amp;rsquo; (19) &amp;ldquo;Then I desired to know the truth about the fourth beast, which was different from all the rest, exceedingly terrifying, with its teeth of iron and claws of bronze, and which devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet, (20) and about the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn that came up and before which three of them fell, the horn that had eyes and a mouth that spoke great things, and that seemed greater than its companions. (21) As I looked, this horn made war with the saints and prevailed over them, (22) until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High, and the time came when the saints possessed the kingdom. (23) &amp;ldquo;Thus he said: &amp;lsquo;As for the fourth beast, there shall be a fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be different from all the kingdoms, and it shall devour the whole earth, and trample it down, and break it to pieces. (24) As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise, and another shall arise after them; he shall be different from the former ones, and shall put down three kings. (25) He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time. (26) But the court shall sit in judgment, and his dominion shall be taken away, to be consumed and destroyed to the end. (27) And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; his kingdom shall be an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.&amp;rsquo; (28) &amp;ldquo;Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly alarmed me, and my color changed, but I kept the matter in my heart.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One suggestion is that Daniel was alarmed in verse 15 because this was a paradigm shift.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the prevailing view of his day, Messiah was not necessarily a deity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet in verse 13, Daniel sees the Ancient of Days (whom we might call &amp;ldquo;the Father&amp;rdquo;) giving the kingdom, the power, and the glory – where have we heard that phrase before? – to the one like a Son of Man, whom we might identify as Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walton (et al.) notes that Jewish writings from before Jesus viewed the &amp;ldquo;son of man&amp;rdquo; as the Jewish Messiah.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John would have been familiar with these documents, particularly &lt;em&gt;1 Enoch&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, the earliest Christians saw the &amp;ldquo;Son of Man&amp;rdquo; as Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel 10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walton estimates Daniel 7 was 552-549 BCE (Babylonian reign of Belshazzar), and Daniel 10 was 537-536 BCE (Persian reign of Cyrus). He notes Daniel 10 is &amp;ldquo;very close to the time when the first wave of Jews are returning from captivity and beginning the rebuilding of the (second) temple.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Again, note the description of the angelic messenger and Daniel&amp;rsquo;s reaction in verses 5-12 compared with Revelation 1:12-18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;(1) In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a word was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar. And the word was true, and it was a great conflict. And he understood the word and had understanding of the vision. (2) In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three weeks. (3) I ate no delicacies, no meat or wine entered my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, for the full three weeks. (4) On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river (that is, the &lt;mark&gt;Tigris&lt;/mark&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(5) I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, &lt;mark&gt;a man clothed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist. (6) His body was like beryl, his face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; (7) And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great trembling fell upon them, and they fled to hide. (8) So I was left alone and saw this great vision, and no strength was left in me. My radiant appearance was fearfully changed, and I retained no strength. &lt;strong&gt;(9) Then I heard the sound of his words, and as I heard the sound of his words, I fell on my face in deep sleep with my face to the ground. (10) And behold, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees. (11) And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;O Daniel, man greatly loved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for now I have been sent to you.&amp;rdquo; And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up trembling. (12) Then he said to me, &amp;ldquo;Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand and humbled yourself before your God, your words have been heard, and I have come because of your words.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(13) The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days, but Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I was left there with the kings of Persia, (14) and came to make you understand what is to happen to your people in the latter days. For the vision is for days yet to come.&amp;rdquo; (15) When he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground and was mute. (16) And behold, one in the &lt;mark&gt;likeness of the children of man&lt;/mark&gt; touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke. I said to him who stood before me, &amp;ldquo;O my lord, by reason of the vision pains have come upon me, and I retain no strength. (17) How can my lord&amp;rsquo;s servant talk with my lord? For now no strength remains in me, and no breath is left in me.&amp;rdquo; (18) Again one having the appearance of a man touched me and strengthened me. (19) And he said, &amp;ldquo;O man greatly loved, fear not, peace be with you; be strong and of good courage.&amp;rdquo; And as he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, &amp;ldquo;Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.&amp;rdquo; (20) Then he said, &amp;ldquo;Do you know why I have come to you? But now I will return to fight against the prince of Persia; and when I go out, behold, the prince of Greece will come. (21) But I will tell you what is inscribed in the book of truth: there is none who contends by my side against these except Michael, your prince.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;12. I turned around to see who was speaking to me; and when I had turned, I saw seven gold menorahs;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Exodus 37:23 And he made its seven lamps and its tongs and its trays of pure gold. Zec 4:2 And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;What do you see?&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember back in verse 10, John heard a great voice behind him. Here he turns to look.
&lt;img src=&#34;images/f37a1158a991a6a4d9acb4a8284cc1ff.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your Bible may say, &amp;ldquo;lampstands or candlesticks,&amp;rdquo; but what John sees is unquestionably a menorah, as Stern translated in the CJB.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He renders as &amp;ldquo;seven menorahs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A menorah has seven branches; this is one Menorah with seven lights. To the right is a photo I took of the Temple Institute Menorah in2013.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later, we will find out that each &amp;ldquo;candlestick&amp;rdquo; is a congregation with Jesus in the midst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Menorah is also reminiscent of a tree or a vine with branches.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus is the vine, and we are the branches (John 15).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus is also the light of the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, the tabernacle/temple menorah was made of gold, which fits with verse 12.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Missler, this scene should remind us of the Tabernacle.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The robe and gold band in verse 13 may allude to the High Priest (Exodus 28:4).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The high priest was the one who tended the Menorah, including snuffing out and correcting if unsatisfactory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lizorkin says, &amp;ldquo;the presence of the Temple menorah would signal to John&amp;rsquo;s audience that his visionary experience took place in the vicinity of the Temple. And more precisely in the inner section of the Temple.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Temple/Tabernacle Menorah also testifies to God&amp;rsquo;s presence.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seven fellowships are supposed to live in such a way that their communities see God&amp;rsquo;s light and presence.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Num 7:89 And when Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with the LORD, he heard the voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim; and it spoke to him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-113-one-like-a-son-of-man&#34;&gt;Rev 1:13: One Like a Son of Man&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Revelation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13. and among the menorahs was someone like a Son of Man, wearing a robe down to his feet and a gold band around his chest&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Exo 28:4 These are the garments that they shall make: a breast piece, an ephod, a robe, a coat of checker work, a turban, and a sash. They shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother and his sons to serve me as priests.  &lt;br&gt;Dan 7:13 &amp;ldquo;I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came &lt;mark&gt;one like a son of man&lt;/mark&gt;, and he came to the &lt;mark&gt;Ancient of Days&lt;/mark&gt; and was presented before him. Dan 10:5 I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, a man clothed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist. &lt;br&gt;Dan 10:16 And behold, &lt;mark&gt;one in the likeness of the children of man&lt;/mark&gt; touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke. I said to him who stood before me, &amp;ldquo;O my lord, by reason of the vision pains have come upon me, and I retain no strength.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is often called the &amp;ldquo;vision of the Risen Christ.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that John noted one dressed as a priest in the &amp;ldquo;midst&amp;rdquo; of the Menorah may suggest he was witnessing Jesus as High Priest in heavenly Tabernacle (Heb 9).
&lt;img src=&#34;images/0fab3a7bee3b9b8d1fbc99ce645b1a4a.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The photo shows the &amp;ldquo;Holy Place,&amp;rdquo; where the Menorah was located. In the foreground is the Table of Showbread. By the curtain leading to the Holy of Holies is the Altar of Incense. (Ex 26:33)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is from a Tabernacle replica that one can visit near Eilat, Israel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, John does NOT identify Jesus but says &amp;ldquo;one like a Son of Man.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John and Jesus were very close during Jesus&amp;rsquo; earthly ministry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presumably, He would have said, &amp;ldquo;and among the Menorahs was Jesus wearing a robe…&amp;quot;…but he didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We know from 1:1 and 22:8 that John is not talking directly with Jesus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This angelic divine being is at the same time Jesus but not quite Jesus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we saw from some of the parallel passages, the description of the one like a Son of Man is inherited from the Ancient of Days.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Baruch Korman writes, &amp;ldquo;This is a depiction of Messiah taking on the mantle of God the father.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Lizorkin writes, &amp;ldquo;The garments are highly symbolic, showing that Jesus is the heavenly priest, fully prepared and qualified to carry out His duties.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Keener writes, &amp;ldquo;the cumulative impact of these images is to present the risen Jesus as the greatest conceivable figure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are numerous parallels among Revelation 1:12-18, Daniel 7, Daniel 10, and to a lesser extent, Ezekiel 1 and even Matthew 17 and the Transfiguration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will compare Revelation 1 and Daniel 10 towards the end of the lesson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus physically is seated at the Right Hand of the Father
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This may explain why it appears to be an Angel and not Jesus directly who speaks with John.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus is to remain seated at the Right Hand until the appointed time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In either case, Jesus is also spiritually amid our fellowships and us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember also that the earthly fellowships were undergoing intense persecution. Perhaps they felt abandoned by God, but here we see God is right in their midst.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

And they sparkled like burnished bronze. &lt;strong&gt;24&lt;/strong&gt; And when they went, I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of many waters, like the sound of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of an army. When they stood still, they let down their wings. &lt;strong&gt;Eze 43:2&lt;/strong&gt; And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east. And the sound of his coming was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone with his glory.&lt;/td&gt;

But your friends be like the sun as he rises in his might.&amp;rdquo; Isa 49:2 He made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand he hid me; he made me a polished arrow; in his quiver he hid me away. Heb 4:12 For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We occasionally see drawings, some quite grotesque in my opinion, of Jesus with a literal sword coming out of His mouth. This misses the point entirely. Obviously, the sword is symbolic. As Lizorkin says, &amp;ldquo;this being is powerful enough to destroy with his voice alone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early Jewish believers saw the two edges as two aspects of the Word of God
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either the &amp;ldquo;law and the prophets&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Moses and Jesus.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, Reformation theology sees &amp;ldquo;Law&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Gospel&amp;rdquo; as opposites. They are not. The opposite of &amp;ldquo;law&amp;rdquo; is not &amp;ldquo;grace&amp;rdquo; but &amp;ldquo;lawlessness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If this is the model, here we see that Law and Gospel are not opposed to each other but are two sides of the same sword&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both bring judgment for the wicked and life for the righteous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Baruch pointed out that a sword also divides and separates, in the sense that in Genesis 1:4, God divided the light from the darkness.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I saw a meme recently that the light never flees in the face of darkness. It is the darkness that runs when confronted by light. For darkness to prevail, the light source must be removed. John 3:19 has more about this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Dan 8:17-18 So he came near where I stood. And when he came, I was frightened and fell on my face. But he said to me, &amp;ldquo;Understand, O son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end.&amp;rdquo; 18 And when he had spoken to me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground. But he touched me and made me stand up.  Dan 10:9-10,12,15 followed by Dan 10:19 And he said, &amp;ldquo;O man greatly loved, fear not, peace be with you; be strong and of good courage.&amp;rdquo; And as he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, &amp;ldquo;Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a common reaction when people in the Bible are given a glimpse of God – even if it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; an angel, they are terrified!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The drawing on the right illustrates Abraham bowing before angelic visitors, one of whom is the &amp;ldquo;Angel of the Lord.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of our Bibles have from 1:17 through the end of chapter 3 in red text; the translators assume Jesus is speaking. It&amp;rsquo;s a fair assumption; however, if we&amp;rsquo;re faithful to the text, John does not record who is speaking.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 1:1 and Rev 22:8 tell us John received the vision from an Angel, not from Jesus directly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuming this is John the Apostle, he knew Jesus better than anyone. Was he afraid because this incredible and terrifying being wasn&amp;rsquo;t Jesus?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if we assume it was Jesus, there is a lesson.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No matter how well you know Jesus, He&amp;rsquo;s still God. We can&amp;rsquo;t get too casual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CS Lewis captures this beautifully in &amp;ldquo;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.&amp;rdquo; Susan Pevensie is talking to Mr. Beaver. &amp;ldquo;Aslan is a lion- the Lion, the great Lion.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Ooh,&amp;rdquo; said Susan. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d thought he was a man. Is he-quite safe? I shall feel rather nervous about meeting a lion&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;strong&gt;Safe&lt;/strong&gt;?&amp;rdquo; said Mr. Beaver &lt;strong&gt;&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;Who said anything about safe? &amp;lsquo;Course he isn&amp;rsquo;t safe&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;But he&amp;rsquo;s good&lt;/strong&gt;. He&amp;rsquo;s the King, I tell you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In any case, the angel has the authority to speak for Jesus and God the Father in the 1st person.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we look back in Genesis, the &amp;ldquo;Angel of the LORD&amp;rdquo; in the Old Testament has the authority to speak for the Father in the first person. It&amp;rsquo;s as if Abraham is communicating with God Himself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe that is the case with John. The text tells us John is not speaking with Jesus directly, but he might as well be since He&amp;rsquo;s the only One who purchased our life with His death&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The safest avenue is to say John is speaking with an Angel of the God of Israel, acknowledging some elasticity in our definitions of the Father, Spirit, and Son.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-118-i-was-dead-but-behold-i-am-alive&#34;&gt;Rev 1:18: &amp;ldquo;I was dead but behold, I Am alive!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Isa 25:8 He will swallow up death forever; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from all faces, and the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for the LORD has spoken.  Hos 13:14 I shall ransom them from the power of Sheol; I shall redeem them from death. O death, where are your plagues? O Sheol, where is your sting?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1 Corinthians 15:54, Paul says, &amp;ldquo;the saying will come about as it is written, &amp;ldquo;Death is swallowed up in victory!&amp;rdquo; He was quoting Isaiah 25:8. The words spoken to John appear linked to this passage also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the great find of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1948 in a cave by the Dead Sea: a complete and relatively intact scroll containing the book of Isaiah. Before this, the most recent full copy of the Hebrew Bible we had was from the 9th or 10th century CE. This scroll dates to 1000 years prior, the 1st Century before Christ, or before the Common Era. There are minor differences only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Conservative scholars tend to see this as an Outline of the book, though this is debated:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you see: the Vision of the Risen Christ – chapter 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The things which are: the seven assemblies/churches - chapters 2-3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The things that shall be after – chapters 4-22&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Greek phrase for &amp;ldquo;after these things&amp;rdquo; is μετα ταυτα meta tauta.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meta tauta acts as a signpost throughout Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Rev 1:19 Write therefore the things that you have seen, those that are and those that are to take place &lt;mark&gt;after this&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 4:1 &lt;mark&gt;After this&lt;/mark&gt; I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 4:1 And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place &lt;mark&gt;after this&lt;/mark&gt;.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 7:1 &lt;mark&gt;after this&lt;/mark&gt; I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, that no wind might blow on earth or sea or against any tree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 7:9 &lt;mark&gt;after this&lt;/mark&gt; I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 9:12 The first woe has passed; behold, two woes are &lt;mark&gt;still to come&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 15:5 &lt;mark&gt;after this&lt;/mark&gt; I looked, and the sanctuary of the tent of witness in heaven was opened&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 18:1 &lt;mark&gt;after this&lt;/mark&gt; I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was made bright with his glory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 19:1 &lt;mark&gt;after this&lt;/mark&gt; I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, crying out, “Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 20:3 and threw him (Satan) into the pit, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he might not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were ended. &lt;mark&gt;After that&lt;/mark&gt; he must be released for a little while.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Tens in the Bible&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are not seven but 10 μετα ταυτα phrases in Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Hebrew Gematria, specific numbers that reappear throughout the Bible are assigned concepts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gematria means that scholars, both ancient sages and modern academics, have studied these patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where they see seven, they notice a general theme of completion or perfection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using this method, 10 represents divine order or law,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most obvious examples are the 10 commandments and the 10 plagues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were also 10 generations from Adam to Noah, where we saw the flood restoring order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were also 10 generations from Noah to Abraham where we received the Abrahamic covenant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Ruth 4, there is a strange prophecy given to Ruth and Boaz, followed by a list of 10 generations from Perez to King David.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ruth 4:12 and may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring that the LORD will give you by this young woman.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you know the story of Tamar and Judah, it&amp;rsquo;s sordid. If you received this &amp;ldquo;blessing,&amp;rdquo; you might be inclined to think &amp;ldquo;same to you, fella!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perez was the product of a &amp;ldquo;forbidden union&amp;rdquo; between Tamar and Judah, her father in-law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deuteronomy 23:2 - &amp;ldquo;No one born of a forbidden union may enter the assembly of the LORD. Even to the &lt;em&gt;tenth&lt;/em&gt; generation, none of his descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The backstory is Tamar&amp;rsquo;s previous husbands (Judah&amp;rsquo;s other sons) had died without issue, and it was Judah&amp;rsquo;s responsibility to see that his line continued.  He failed to do this, so Tamar posed as a prostitute and went into to Judah.  Of course, she became pregnant by him.  When Judah found out that his daughter in law had played the harlot, he was furious.  He was about to have her executed when she presented evidence that he was the father of the child.  Oops.  The son&amp;rsquo;s name was Perez.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The end of Ruth connects the dots for us by listing 10 generations from Perez to David the King.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a spiritual perspective, this was yet another attempt by Satan to sabotage the lineage of Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tamar perhaps unknowingly, saw to it that the line continued, and indeed she is one of the four women noted in Jesus&amp;rsquo; genealogy (Matthew 1:3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;20. Here is the secret meaning of the seven stars you saw in my right hand, and of the seven gold menorahs: the seven stars are the angels of the seven Messianic communities, and the seven menorahs are the seven Messianic communities.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Zech 4: 2 And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;What do you see?&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/06d103558029ba8fd995cd8e7e4bea39.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A topic of debate is whether the seven stars/angels are natural or supernatural&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About all the &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; camp has going for it is our western minds can understand it better.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this view, the angels of each congregation are human.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More than likely, the messenger would be the pastor of each community or a designated reader in the synagogue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, no church leadership position is ever called an angel or messenger anywhere else in the New Testament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In favor of the supernatural angel view, the entire book of Revelation has angels everywhere, so why not in Chapters 2 and 3?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewish texts often portray angels as stars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this view, churches/fellowships have designated angels just like nations do.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Daniel 10, the angelic messenger had to do battle with the spirit of Persia and then had to go back to do battle with the spirit of Greece.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, there is a heavenly counterpart to an earthly reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Admittedly it is foreign to think of a fellowship having a &amp;ldquo;guardian angel.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If our churches had such an angel, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it keep false teaching and division out of the church?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protestants tend to deemphasize angels, which is odd given that &amp;ldquo;angels&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;angel&amp;rdquo; appears over 180 times in the New Testament- about 80 times in Revelation and the other 100 in the rest of the New Testament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is probably much more going on in the supernatural angelic community than most of us realize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In both Hebrew and Greek, the meaning could be either a supernatural angel or a natural messenger. However, only about six times out of the 180 can we be certain that the word references only a human messenger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This certainly raises several questions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do churches today have designated angels?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was this a 1st-century phenomenon?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was it ONLY these seven specially designated congregations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who knows!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By having the stars in his right hand, the hand of power, John is possibly communicating, &amp;ldquo;Christ is Lord over the universe including Lord over the angels who guide the churches as well as the nations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keener also notes given the tensions between non-messianic and messianic branches of Judaism in that day, &amp;ldquo;by identifying the churches as (a menorah), John claims that the Jesus movement is the true form of Judaism.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One thing we do know: a menorah&amp;rsquo;s purpose is to give off light in a dark place
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is what our churches should be doing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is what we as disciples should be doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a postscript, let&amp;rsquo;s do a quick side-by-side of Revelation 1 and Daniel 10. In this way, we can see how the book we hold in our laps or in our smart devices is ONE book with one consistent message from beginning to end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The being&amp;rsquo;s clothing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5 clothed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13 clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash around his chest.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Head/face&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6 his face like the appearance of lightning, (Dan 7:9 the hair of his head like pure wool)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14 The hairs of his head were white, like white wool, like snow.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Eyes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6 his eyes like flaming torches&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14 His eyes were like a flame of fire,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Arms &amp;amp; Legs/Feet&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6 his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15 his feet were like burnished bronze, refined in a furnace,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Voice&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6 the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15 and his voice was like the roar of many waters.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Reaction&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt; as I heard the sound of his words, I fell on my face in deep sleep with my face to the ground.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17 When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Commission&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; And behold, a hand touched me&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17 But he laid his right hand on me,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Assurance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt; Then he said to me, &amp;ldquo;Fear not, Daniel,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17 saying, &amp;ldquo;Fear not, I am the first and the last, 18 and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In NATIVITY focuses exlusively on Joseph.  He is fully prepared to do the thing expected of a Tzadik who has been wronged - seek no shame or revenge, but divorce her quietly.  Through this painful process, Joseph learns a lesson about how the light of Messiah can shine unexpectedly out of personal disappointments.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 2:1-38 (coming soon!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;matthew-118-19-marys-condition-and-josephs-dilemma&#34;&gt;Matthew 1:18-19 Mary&amp;rsquo;s Condition and Joseph&amp;rsquo;s Dilemma&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;th&gt;Matthew 1:18&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Heb 7:26&lt;/sup&gt; For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen 3:15&lt;/sup&gt; I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until now, miraculous births in the Bible still required a male/female union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek traditions (as well as Genesis 6) speak of gods impregnating women but nothing about the text indicates Mary’s conception was in any way sexual.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God spoke the universe into existence. He created Eve from Adam’s rib.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He could have achieved Mary’s pregnancy by speaking it or any number of other “contactless” ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a minimum, The Virgin Birth removes the stain of sin (often called original sin) that occurs whenever a human x and human y chromosome merge. Hebrews 7 reminds us that Jesus is “holy, innocent, unstained and separated from sinners.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tidbit about the Virgin Birth. In Genesis 3:15 God says to the serpent, “I will put enmity between your seed and HER seed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “seed of the woman” is one of the many names of the Jewish Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a seemingly biological contradiction. The seed is in the man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way back in Genesis, many scholars believe we have a hint of the virgin birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wells and Caves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:3.29028in;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eastern tradition (Greek, Russian orthodox, etc.) holds that the annunciation occurred at this well, in keeping with the rich tradition of momentous events happening at wells or springs throughout scripture. Abraham, Jacob, Gideon, and even Jesus in John 4 has the famous meeting with the Samaritan woman at the well.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western (Roman Catholic) tradition holds that the annunciation was in a cave that today is venerated at the Catholic Church of the Annunciation in Nazareth.
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:3.29028in;float:right&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caves are also prominent in the Bible with Abraham purchasing the cave at Machpelah in Hebron as a burial place, David establishing his superiority over Saul in a cave (though he later regretted it), Elijah, before he killed the priests of Baal, he found them hiding in caves,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John the Baptist traditionally lived in caves, and it is widely believed that both the birth of Jesus and the events described in the Garden of Gethsemane both took place in caves. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col style=&#34;width: 50%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&#34;width: 50%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;large&gt;Matthew 1:19&lt;/large&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;And her husband Joseph, &lt;u&gt;being a just man&lt;/u&gt; and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tzadik – &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;צַדִּיק&lt;/span&gt; – righteous one; not sinless but in the sense of Michah 6:8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Micah 6:8&lt;/sup&gt; He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you? but to do justice, and to love kindness (mercy), and to walk humbly with your God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Deu 22:23-24&lt;/sup&gt; “If there is a betrothed virgin, and a man meets her in the city and lies with her, then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones, the young woman because she did not cry for help though she was in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbor&#39;s wife. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mat 5:32&lt;/sup&gt; But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rom 12:7&lt;/sup&gt; Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as the Spirit wanted us to know that Zechariah was righteous, He wants us to know that Joseph was righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the Hebrew word for a righteous one is tzadik. Abraham was a tzadik, Boaz was a Tsadik and here Joseph is a Tzadik&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you read proverbs and it says the righteous do such and such but the wicked do such and such, the word for righteous is almost always tsadik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be a tzadik does not require sinless perfection, but it essentially means the person is living out Deuteronomy 6:5, love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, might and Leviticus 19:18 Love your neighbor as yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these are restated in Micah 6:8, He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you? but to do justice, and to love kindness (mercy), and to walk humbly with your God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus gives us all the power to be tzadikim (pl), just like Joseph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we weren’t acting like a tsaddik yesterday, today is a new day in the Lord who makes each of us a new creation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling Joseph a Tzadik rules out Joseph being the biological father (at least not in the usual sense – see speculation below); a just man wouldn’t have had relations before marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The angelic visitation is confirmation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph did have a decision to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Joseph&amp;rsquo;s No Good Options&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike today, the engaged couple entered into a marriage covenant upon the announcement of the betrothal (today we only enter into such a contract after the wedding ceremony).
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:4.41111in;float:right&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract is called a Ketubah and today at Jewish weddings, they are often done as beautiful artwork such as the one pictured.[^6]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To break an agreement of betrothal required a legal divorce&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources indicate divorce in this situation was REQUIRED (if the child was not his)[^7]; Jesus even affirms that divorce is appropriate in the scenario of adultery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to the Mishna, adultery during a betrothal period was &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; serious than that done after the wedding.[^8]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph, as the injured party, had full control over what happened to Mary in terms of judicial punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1&lt;/strong&gt;: She could have been subject to the death penalty for adultery, which is death by stoning (Deuteronomy 22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that she was obviously pregnant probably would have been enough for such a conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way it worked, was the injured party (for example the next of kin in a murder case) would be the one to cast the first stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember this nugget when we get to John 8 and the woman caught in adultery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commentators are split on whether Mary had a chance to plead her case to Joseph or whether Joseph assumed what to him was obvious. They would not have been allowed to be alone together but this does not exclude a conversation between Mary and Joseph with another adult present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can infer that Joseph loved her. If they had discussed if any part of him wanted to believe her; this would make it nearly impossible for him to be the one to cause her death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although some of the reasons the Bible gives for the death penalty may sound harsh by our standards, in practice the death penalty was rarely carried out. The Mishna records the following: “Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says a Sanhedrin that executes a transgressor once in seventy years (is considered a bloodthirsty tribunal)”[^9]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on what we know about Joseph, he was very unlikely to consider this option, and Matthew confirms this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2&lt;/strong&gt;: public divorce followed by public shame followed by exile – she would not be welcome in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Honor and Shame” was very strong in the ancient world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have honor and shame too, but we get it backwards; we &lt;strong&gt;encourage&lt;/strong&gt; shame (Netflix, Reality TV) and &lt;strong&gt;discourage&lt;/strong&gt; honor. It’s supposed to be the other way around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She and her child would have to fend for themselves in a society that did not take kindly to single mothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tzadik doesn’t seek revenge or seek to cause harm to another, even when he is wronged; therefore, #2 is also an unlikely option for Joseph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 12:17 reminds us that we should never repay evil for evil. This is a verse we must consider carefully whenever we are considering a legal remedy in response to a financial or physical injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it wasn’t written in Romans yet, Joseph modeled this behavior. He took door #3, which was the only option left to him (so he thought).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 3&lt;/strong&gt;: “Divorce her quietly” likely means Joseph was prepared to pay the fee to the father of the bride to break the engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is somewhat like a legal settlement where neither side admits any wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph is not going to press the issue of infidelity, and in so doing, HE would not directly bring any shame on Mary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, her condition would eventually be obvious and Mary would suffer the consequences of her actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without an accuser, there would be no judicial punishment, but she and her newborn would likely have been exiled from the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 4?&lt;/strong&gt;: As we mentioned above, the one thing he did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have the option to do was to marry her. At least not prior to verse 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law forbade it, so he would be sinning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing so would be an admission that He fathered the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such an admission would be (and as best we can tell, ultimately WAS) treated accordingly by the small, tight-night, and religiously observant community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes the sacrifice Joseph is about to make even MORE remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Since Joseph didn&amp;rsquo;t divorce Mary, why bother mentioning that he was thinking about it? Could there be a significant truth?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of being a disciple is asking questions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original &lt;em&gt;talmidim&lt;/em&gt; were frequently asking questions to make sure they understood what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Timothy 3:16-17 tells us that all scripture is profitable…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we read the text, we want to begin to question everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At various points, we want to ask, “why does the Spirit want me to know this?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically in this case, given that Joseph ultimately did NOT divorce Mary, why is it “profitable” for us to know that he was considering it even though he didn’t go through with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes all we can do is speculate, but as long as our loosely held theory doesn’t contradict Scripture or is refuted by historical facts we can continue to pursue it. We are very likely to learn something (or at least understand why our theory is false); either way, we grow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given what we discussed in the last lesson about the apparent extraordinary lengths God went to assure Jesus had the right credentials to be the Messiah, verse 19 potentially represents a momentary crisis point in the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had Satan enticed Joseph to follow through with the divorce, is it possible Jesus would have no connection or claim to the Royal line of David, and the whole messianic plan would have fallen apart?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put this another way, Jesus would have gone on to be the sinless Son of God with or without Joseph’s parenting. Why was Joseph’s NOT divorcing Mary worthy of mention?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can infer &lt;strong&gt;having Joseph involved must be extremely significant&lt;/strong&gt; somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence the very reasonable theory that the adoption by Joseph as the legal father is a required precondition to Jesus’ Messiahship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, with God&amp;rsquo;s plan momentarily in jeopardy, God must directly intervene once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;matthew-120-21-josephs-course-correction&#34;&gt;Matthew 1:20-21 Joseph&amp;rsquo;s Course Correction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.&#34;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is 51:7 “Listen to me, you who know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear not the reproach of man, nor be dismayed at their revilings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“conceived” = γεννάω, literally “begotten”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 49:5 And now the LORD says, he who formed me from the womb to be his servant…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given all we’ve discussed, the command to take Mary as his wife is staggering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angel reminded Joseph that he is a Son of David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joseph is not just in the bloodline of King David, he’s in the much more exclusive royal line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph then receives supernatural confirmation that Mary is not an adulteress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted previously, in any other circumstance, Joseph would be sinning if he married Mary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angel tells him that he’s not sinning by marrying her&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this introduces another problem. By proceeding with the wedding, Joseph was communicating that the child was his &lt;em&gt;and that he had acted less than honorably before marriage. No one at the time was going to believe their story about an immaculate conception&lt;/em&gt;. Not very many believe it today for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, we have a contradiction –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The baby’s not his, so he can’t marry her; he’s a tsadik and a tsadik doesn’t willfully break the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, he DOES marry her even though the baby’s not his (or is it?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster speculates that among the infinite number of ways God could have engineered the pregnancy, we can’t rule out that Joseph’s DNA was not &lt;em&gt;somehow, someway,&lt;/em&gt; a part of the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this is speculation, but such a move resolves any legal quandaries, namely the requirement for Joseph to divorce Mary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This move would also assure the royal Davidic line continued to be blood-based but would (again, somehow, some way) not have the stain of the curse.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, think about the ramifications for Joseph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us not overlook his sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph, Mary, and Jesus all had to live with the stigma of a crime they didn’t commit (and back then it was a crime) and for which the folks in a small town would have presumed their guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This perhaps adds new context to the angel’s encouragement to “do not fear”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 51:7 says “do not fear the reproach of men.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek word &lt;em&gt;genneas&lt;/em&gt; does not imply sexual conception;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is more along the lines of being miraculously formed in the womb as with Isaiah 49:5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more, it could be understood as miraculously placed in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nicene Creed attempts to deal with this by saying Jesus is “begotten not made, of one essence with the father by whom all things were made.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ Hebrew/Aramaic name is Yeshua, which means salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is wordplay, albeit highly significant wordplay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אֶת־שְׁמוֹ יֵשׁוּעַ כִּי הוּא יוֹשִׁיעַ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew likely meant “His people” denotatively (literally). His people were the Jewish people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jews are His natural born people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gentiles that are His are His by adoption (Romans 8:15, Galatians 4:5) and grafting (Romans 11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;matthew-122-23-jesus-fulfills-isaiah-714&#34;&gt;Matthew 1:22-23 Jesus Fulfills Isaiah 7:14&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: “Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel” (which means, God with us).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 7:13-&lt;/sup&gt;14 And he said, “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also? [14] Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1Pe 3:15&lt;/sup&gt; but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mat 28:20&lt;/sup&gt; And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew is using a literary device called &lt;em&gt;inclusio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inclusio&lt;/em&gt; is using the same or similar wording at both the beginning and the ending of a paragraph, passage, or in this case an entire book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we consider the genealogy a preamble, he’s essentially beginning his gospel with “God with us”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew ends his gospel with “I AM with you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the first of the statements on fulfilled prophecy cited by Matthew.
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:5.68403in;float:right&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The photo is from the “Great Isaiah Scroll” one of the Dead Sea scrolls which dates to the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; century BC that was discovered in 1947.  The bottom two lines are Isaiah 7:14.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;answering-common-challenges-to-matthew-123&#34;&gt;Answering Common Challenges to Matthew 1:23&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with more conservative theological beliefs would contend Matthew was inspired by the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Through this lens, we contend Matthew supernaturally saw that Isaiah’s prophecy regarding the birth of &lt;code&gt;Immanuel&lt;/code&gt; had messianic fulfillment by the virgin birth of Yeshua.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, theological conservatives have less of a problem taking Matthew (and indeed the entire Bible) at face value than do those with a more liberal Christian worldview or a non-Christian worldview.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-missionaries&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and other critics/skeptics often cite several problems with Matthew’s hermaneutical methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the most part, these arguments &lt;em&gt;do have some validity&lt;/em&gt;; therefore, we believe such exploration is a worthwhile exercise, even though those of us reading this commentary may be firm in our beliefs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is to our benefit to know and understand common so-called &amp;ldquo;problems&amp;rdquo; with the Bible to have a ready response if asked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Peter 3:15 tells us to be prepared to give every man an answer for the hope that is within us doing so with gentleness and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of discipleship is having that initial conversation with a non-believer, whether that person is a skeptic or has never heard Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are called to provide reasons, and sound, logical arguments, for the hope we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if not checked, seeds of doubt can grow into weeds that impede our own discipleship.  We must be absolutely confident that God&amp;rsquo;s word is true, and we must live like we are confident in it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chuck Missler used to say, &amp;ldquo;if you think you&amp;rsquo;ve found an error in the Bible, rejoice!  There are no errors in the Bible, and the journey you take to confirm that for yourself will result in a blessing.&amp;rdquo;  AMEN!&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times, such a defense may require us to provide refutations to arguments that attack the core fundamentals of the faith (in this case, the inerrancy of the Apostolic writings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of doing so with gentleness and respect, I would say rebutting an argument is ONLY worthwhile if the other person is making a legitimate academic inquiry and seeking an answer in good faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should not pick fights or try to win points in a social media discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending your time and energy answering someone who doesn’t really want to listen to you is an example of “casting your pearls before swine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, let’s look at some of the common challenges, and then we’ll provide some rebuttals and rationales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Challenge #1: Matthew takes the passages out of context. This passage in Isaiah was a sign given to King Ahaz about King Hezekiah’s birth (who many had hoped would be the messiah).&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Response: Yes, he does ignore the original context for the most part. In context, we agree the prophecy was given to King Ahaz 700 years before Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew follows Jewish methods of Scripture interpretation and application of his day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such methods leverage word-play, gematria, and hyper-literal application called &lt;em&gt;Midrash&lt;/em&gt; related to &lt;em&gt;drosh&lt;/em&gt;, to seek out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apostolic era midrash involves the transposition of a biblical text to a different application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no way my professors at Liberty University would let me get away with such methods of hermeneutics today, but they were common and accepted in the first century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many prophecies Matthew will cite have a dual application – one immediate to the time and another to the days of Messiah (and from a Christian perspective, this could either be the first coming or the second).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac Troki&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, one of the earliest published books that today’s anti-missionary groups rely on is called “Faith Strengthened” written in the mid 1500’s by Isaac Troki. Troki first documented most of the arguments we are discussing here in this section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troki is from the Karaite branch of Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an estimated 40,000 followers today (that is to say fairly small), Karaites break with most of traditional Judaism in rejecting the Oral Torah including the midrashic methods of interpretation used by almost every other branch of modern Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it’s easy for him to attack Matthew’s methods of Judaic interpretation because Troki himself didn’t agree with them according to his lens of Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also wouldn’t agree with the hermeneutic traditions of most other traditional Jewish sects, including the beliefs of those today who cite his book to attack Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Challenge #2: Matthew takes the passages &amp;lsquo;hyper-literally.&amp;rsquo; He&amp;rsquo;s reading things into the text that aren&amp;rsquo;t there.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-   Challenge: **He takes the passage hyper-literally.** Nothing about the passage implies a Virgin will still be a virgin when she conceives. It only requires that she be a virgin when the prophecy was given.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-   Response: Also true; but Matthew was also saying the most supernatural part of the prophecy remained unfulfilled in Ahaz’s day: the fact that the virgin will be a virgin when she conceives.

-   While the prophecy was most directly to King Ahaz (who lived 700 years before Jesus), Isaiah also said, “hear then, HOUSE OF DAVID…” – the prophecy can apply to the entire line; not just one man.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Challenge #3: The Hebrew word Matthew says means &lt;code&gt;virgin&lt;/code&gt; could also mean &lt;code&gt;a young woman&lt;/code&gt;, who is not necessarily a virgin.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Response: This complaint is more flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same people just got through arguing that the person need only be a virgin at the time the prophecy was written. For the woman to NOT be a virgin, would be a curse, not a prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six other times the word &lt;em&gt;alma&lt;/em&gt; is used in the Bible; most of the time it is unambiguously a virgin as we think of the word. The other couple of times, it could be ambiguous potentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not much of a sign when a young woman gets pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the nail in the coffin of this complaint is when the Jewish scholars translated the Hebrew Bible into the Greek Septuagint, they used the unambiguous Greek word for virgin, Parthenos, παρθένος&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, 200 years before the birth of Jesus, the Jewish sages believed Isaiah meant “virgin” as we think of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Challenge #4: Judaism never teaches a virgin birth. The Christian concept of the &lt;code&gt;Immaculate Conception&lt;/code&gt; is straight out of Greco-Roman paganism.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Response: as we noted at the beginning of this lesson, pagan conceptions between gods and virgin females were ALWAYS sexual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened to Mary was in NO WAY sexual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we acknowledge that two of the four gospels don’t mention the virgin birth and several apostolic writers including Paul never mentions it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-   An argument as to why this could be that they didn’t find it all that surprising because they knew Jewish tradition, which DOES in fact have several TRADITIONS and LEGENDS of supernatural conceptions and births.[^13]
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible recounts several “closed wombs” that were supernaturally opened by God, making all of those conceptions miraculous works of God. By definition, a virgin’s womb is closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not from the Bible, Jewish legend holds that Isaac, Moses, and David also were supernaturally conceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dead Sea Scrolls written around the time of Jesus contain a fragment of a legend that holds Noah was supernaturally conceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t saying these non-biblical legends are true, and that is not the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that a Jewish supernatural conception of a person God used mightily would have resonated with the early apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they may have initially had their doubts, once they heard the story as authenticated by Matthew and Luke (of whom we have no reason to believe they were being deceitful or delusional), the other Jewish apostles had no reason to doubt any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virgin birth has nothing to do with pagan mythology that anti-missionaries object to.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;matthew-124-25-josephs-revised-decision&#34;&gt;Matthew 1:24-25 Joseph&amp;rsquo;s Revised Decision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Matthew 1:24-25&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Reference&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mishnah Bava Batra 8:6, 134a&lt;/sup&gt; If one says: &amp;ldquo;This is my son,&amp;rdquo; he is believed, as regards the right of inheritance”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern notes, “Joseph’s behavior indicated that he accepted Yeshua as his son.” The Mishnah states, “he is to be believed; thus Yeshua, as a legally acknowledged son, is entitled to inherit the throne of King David from Joseph.” &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps this supports the speculation that (somehow, someway) Jesus WAS Joseph’s son.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a minimum, it appears Joseph married Mary &lt;strong&gt;immediately&lt;/strong&gt; to attempt to minimize her (and now their) shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By doing so, he also created the impression among the 200 or so other townsfolk of Nazareth that he faltered and fathered the child. They probably knew the timing didn’t line up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, to see both sides, there is another line of thought that says the folk in Nazareth, which means “branch town,” i.e., branch of David, believed the messiah would eventually come from their midst, so maybe the situation isn’t as dire as we might imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we go through the gospels, where it may be of value to our own discipleship, we will try to learn to critically question many of the standard conclusions made and passed down by commentators over the years to see if there might not be another equally plausible explanation for what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we will look for examples that allow us to exhibit Leviticus 19:18 better and give others the benefit of the doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, word got out, and Jesus’ detractors learned about Jesus’ seemingly inappropriate conception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several examples of ancient anti-Christian literature claim that Jesus resulted from an affair Mary had with a Roman soldier named Pantera (yes, children of the 80s, you heard that right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only have the one event from Jesus’ childhood where he visits the Temple, so nothing is recorded of any trauma or struggles in His childhood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 8, Psalm 69 and others might indicate the family was subjected to abuse because of the apparent scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew skips over the birth narrative with the shepherds, which we find in Luke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish boys were not named until the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day, at their circumcision&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another subtle hint that the Magi were not there the night of Jesus’ birth but came later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll spoil this and many other of your favorite Christmas traditions when we get to Luke 2!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anti-missionaries are traditional Jews who believe Christianity is a dangerous anti-Jewish cult and work to prevent, refute, and undo any Christian missionary efforts among Jews. “Jews for Jesus” is a messianic missionary group. “Jews for Judaism” is an anti-missionary group.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In NATIVITY part II, Joseph and Mary must travel to Bethlehem to take part in a census. Five miles from Jerusalem, Bethlehem serves as the birthplace of David and King Messiah. Close by at Migdal Eder, a group of shepherds is startled by an angel who announces the birth of the Messiah. The new family makes their first trip to the Temple in Jerusalem, where they encounter a holy man and a prophetess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Videos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;geographic-setting&#34;&gt;Geographic Setting:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 2 is our first encounter where geography plays a significant supporting role in our understanding of the Gospels. In just about every remaining chapter in the Gospels, we will want to pause to understand the geographic background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.875in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This satellite photo shows two possible travel routes from Nazareth to Bethlehem&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The more direct route would take them through Samaria along the Way of the Patriarchs. In other words, this is the same road that Abraham and Jacob traveled frequently. It’s about 70 miles to Jerusalem going this way. While we’re often taught that Jews and Samaritans avoided each other at all costs, it was not unheard of for Jews to use this road. Luke doesn’t tell us which way they traveled, but we know Jesus traveled the shorter route on at least one occasion in John 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way around would take travelers from Galilee, through the Jezreel valley, around Mt. Gilboa, where they would follow the Jordan down to Jericho. At Jericho, they would hang a right to make the grueling climb along the Ascent of Adummim up to Jerusalem. The photo below shows the climb from 800-1200 feet below sea level at Jericho (depending on where you measure) to 2500 feet above at Jerusalem.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Going in this direction added an extra 20 miles to the journey and required fording the Jordan a couple of times. We know for sure Jesus traveled this way as He made His way up to Jerusalem for the final time of His earthly ministry after he met with Zacchaeus and Bartimaeus in Jericho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.875in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several examples Luke paints a very different picture of “the Christmas story” than many of us have grown up with. We call these &amp;ldquo;Christmyth Busters.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christmyth: A December birth for Jesus is unlikely.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One large problem with assuming a December birth is that the dirt roads would have been nearly impassable in early winter because of the snow, rain, and mud. If we assume they took the long route along the Jordan – ~90 miles, the Jordan river would have been swollen and the banks flooded. In short, it is unlikely that a roman administrator in his right mind would have conducted a census at this time of year (think of the alps in Italy and the mountains in Turkey). To be fair, not all Roman emperors were in their right minds although that charge has never been leveled against Augustus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned in &lt;strong&gt;Annunciations&lt;/strong&gt;, there is strong tradition to suggest John the Baptist was born in the spring, which means Jesus would have been borm six months later in the early fall.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luke 2:1-3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;In those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria. And all went to be registered, each to his own town.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Act 5:37&lt;/sup&gt; After him Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and drew away some of the people after him. He too perished, and all who followed him were scattered.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:40%;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Matthew gives us only a brief overview regarding Jesus&amp;rsquo; actual birth – remember his only mention was in Matthew 1:24; everything after that verse is AFTER his birth – Luke will give us a lot more detail. We said in Luke 1 that Luke’s intent is to give us an orderly account. Luke is focused on who Jesus was, so we’re going to get a lot of detail about the human side of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars and skeptics have a problem with Luke’s dating of the Quirinius census to AD 6, which would have been way too late to have occurred at the time of Jesus’ birth. King Herod died in 4 BC, so Jesus’ birth had to be before Herod’s death. The problem is we have no historical evidence of a census that occurred during the later stages of Herod’s life. We must remember that “absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.” This is the fallacy the skeptics are engaging in with their argument. They’re assuming Luke made an error, for which we similarly have no evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Bible itself, Acts 5:37 tells us that Luke knew exactly when the AD6 census was because he references it directly. Again this is one of those instances where the Narrative would have been just fine with “Judas the Galilean rose up and drew away some of the people” but the Holy Spirit adds “in the days of the census.” This, in my opinion, is the Holy Spirit anticipating the Quirinius question and letting us know that Luke was referencing a different census in Luke 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we don’t have any extrabiblical evidence to support a worldwide census around 5 BC, we do have some reasonable clues to suggest Luke is accurate. Of course, I and I presume most watching this video will start with our presupposition that the Bible is inerrant in its original manuscripts. We have no reason to doubt Luke, therefore we contend he’s telling the truth. To be fair, not every person (not even each who professes to be a Christian) has our presupposition; so, it doesn’t hurt to dig deeper to be educated on plausible explanations in case we are asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke mentions Caesar Augustus. Caesar Augustus (63 BC-AD 14) was the first Roman emperor. He reigned as emperor from 27 BC to AD 14.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; One theme of Luke is that in many places, he appears to be “pro-roman.” Centurions are often the “good guys” in Luke’s narrative. In Acts, Luke is careful to say it’s not the Romans causing trouble, but the religious establishment. This gives support to the speculation that Luke wrote Luke and Acts as affidavits for Paul’s trial at Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an executive, Augustus was among the greatest of all the emperors. Although there are no records of him ever ordering a worldwide census, it is not unlikely that he did. We presume this census must have served a needed function in the administration of the Roman Empire. In God’s providence, it was used to bring Joseph and Mary from Nazareth to Bethlehem in order to fulfill the prophecy of the Messiah’s birth in Micah 5:2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:3.95694in;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, archaeology may help us resolve the conundrum. This tombstone doesn’t mention Quirinius by name but it mentions someone who was TWICE legate of Syria and Phoenicia during the time of Augustus.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This presents a couple of reasonable explanations. 1. Quirinus conducted at least two censuses: one in AD 6 for which we have extrabiblical confirmation, and one at the time of Jesus for which we do not. 2. Formen suggests Quirinius may have &lt;em&gt;completed&lt;/em&gt; a census in AD 6 that was started much earlier.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 3. The Greek word “proto” can mean first, but it can also mean before. A prototype is an early model before the final version. This could be the census BEFORE Quirinius. Critics and skeptics like to point to apparent discrepancies in an attempt to cast doubt on the text, but usually all it takes is a little digging to develop alternate plausible theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect that would be good for us to be more comfortable with is certain tensions in the biblical text. They are nothing to be afraid of. When the Jewish sages encountered such matters in the Hebrew Bible, they often write “this is a difficulty,” then go on to postulate on what may be going on. Often there is not agreement between sages on how to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Lencioni wrote a business book called the “five dysfunctions of a team.” A fear of conflict and artificial harmony is one of those disfunctions. Lencioni says that open, candid dialogue and constructive conflict is how teams grow; and I would add it’s how disciples grow too. We don’t fully grow by being spoon-fed a bunch of facts. We grow by challenging and being challenged by the text so that we resolve all conflicts as best we can, and in so doing we thoroughly own and understand the text and make it our own. Discipleship is not always comfortable (ask Peter); following Jesus is not a spectator sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image5.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:1.51389in; float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For forty-five years continuously, I have devoted myself to one great study of the Old Testament, in all of its languages, in all of its archaeology in all of its translations. The critics of the Bible who go to in order to find fault claim themselves as all knowledge, all virtue, all love of the truth&amp;hellip;I can affirm that there is not a page of the Old Testament concerning which you need have any doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert D. Wilson, Ph.D (1856-1930).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would add that the New Testament is equally reliable. Whenever you think you’ve found an error, rejoice. There are no errors. What follows will likely be an exciting journey into deeper understanding that draws you closer to the Author of the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luke 2:4-5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the “Genealogies” lesson, we discussed the theory that Matthew presents Jesus’ line through Joseph and Luke presents His line through Mary. This enables Jesus also to be of the “house” and “Lineage” of David but without the curse on the bloodline documented in Jeconiah 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/luke2-4-jezreel.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned earlier, it was common for Jews in Galilee who were traveling to Jerusalem to bypass Samaria by traveling south through the Jordan Rift. Luke 17:11 mentions that Jesus traveled between Samaria and Galilee on His way to Jerusalem. Mount Gilboa is the northernmost of the mountains of Samaria. Joseph and Mary may have skirted these mountains by passing past Jezreel and through the Harod Valley.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This is one of my more favorite locations in Israel. I have many favorite locations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christmyth: No mention of a Donkey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our next Christmyth buster, neither Luke nor Matthew indicates they made the journey on a donkey or any other animal. In fact, this is unlikely as only the wealthy could afford an animal for travel. We know from the offering they made to redeem Mary’s purification at the temple, that they were poor. See comment at verse 22.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/luke2-6-bethlehem.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; /&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christmyth: Jesus was not born immediately after Mary arrived in Bethlehem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were in Bethlehem for some undetermined amount of time before Mary’s delivery. They did not come into town late at night with a medical emergency only to be met with doors slammed in their faces.  They had plenty of time to find suitable lodging.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luke 2:7&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn (guesthouse).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christmyth: our conceptions about “no room at the inn” are all wrong.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image8.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:50%;float:right&#34; /&gt;We often imagine Mary being rejected by a grumpy innkeeper at the exact moment of an impending medical emergency and all they could find was some stinky animal feeding trough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Luke is clear that Jesus’ birth was unusual, this isn’t quite what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No room at the Inn” is an extremely poor translation. There was no room at the &lt;em&gt;katalyma&lt;/em&gt;, which is a guest room that is part of a private dwelling. Luke uses a different word for a commercial innkeeper – &lt;em&gt;pandocheion&lt;/em&gt; in Luke 10:34 and the Good Samaritan story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a more logical explanation: a &lt;em&gt;katalyma&lt;/em&gt; is simply not an appropriate place for a birth. Guest rooms were likely full because of the census so they were likely sharing sleeping space. A birth is an intimate moment for the family and quite likely Mary made some screams (I don’t think they had epidurals back then), both of which make it uncomfortable and awkward to have others around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no question, however, that Jesus’ entry into the world was humble and lowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they often did do was build their houses so that the basement (if I could use that term) was a cave. They would build the upper levels of the house on top. The custom in that day is that’s where they would keep the livestock. That sounds foreign to us, but that’s what they did. That’s what the picture above is showing (although we’re pretty sure Mary did not have the incandescent light bulb to light her way).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christmyth: Jesus was not born in a stable.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image9.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:35%;float:right&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“(The evidence) suggests Jesus was born in the main quarters of a house which…may have incorporated a cave into its living space.”[^7]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This illustration was drawn in the 1880s and provides another illustration for what the scene might have looked like if Mary gave birth to Jesus in a room in the house where animals were kept.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-cave-tradition&#34;&gt;The Cave tradition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early church tradition places Jesus birth in a cave. One fact about history is the next occupying force was tended not to respect previous folk’s holy places. The fact that the people were able to be conquered was taken as a sign that their gods were weak. In approximately 135, the wicked Emperor Hadrian (yes the same guy with the wall in England) thought he would stamp out Judaism and this weird offshoot that came to be called Christianity by converting all of their holy places to pagan roman shrines. He did this with the Temple and the church of Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem and he did this with a certain Cave in Bethlehem. In other words, he wouldn’t have tried to erase these locations if they weren’t significant; it shows these sites were revered long before Hadrian came along. So far from erasing this history, he actually marked and preserved these locations for posterity. Thank you Hadrian!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-28-15-the-shepherds&#34;&gt;Luke 2:8-15 The Shepherds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luke 2:8-12&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And in the same region, there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.  And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear.  And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.  For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Messiah the Lord. And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.” &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image10.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.30833in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here and verse 15 we know that the shepherds were some distance away from Bethlehem&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words they could not have been there at the moment of Jesus’ birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another strike against a December birth is that it probably would have been far too cold to keep flocks out by night. In fact, it suggests the opposite. When it was warmer, the sheep would pasture by night; when it was cooler, they pasture during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern notes, “shepherding was and is a despised occupation in the Middle East,” and stands in stark contrast with the Magi of Matthew 2, who were at the opposite end of the social scale. “Both came to honor the messiah (because he is the) Messiah of high and low alike.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is already the third “fear not” in Luke (to Zechariah, Mary, and now the Shepherds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image11.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:4.89068in;height:3.5in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“City of David” is a term that is used interchanably for Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Both cities claim King David the way both Abilene, Kansas and Dennison Texas claim Eisenhower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember Yeshua is connected for the words for salvation and savior. In Luke 1:47 Mary’s “spirit rejoices in God (her) Savior.” Here it is clear that the Savior is the Messiah, Yeshua and therefore Messiah = God of Israel. This is one of the dots that Luke is connecting for us gentiles. Think of this the next time you ask whether someone is “saved”? You are REALLY asking “Are you Jesus’d?” Do you have joy in being Jesus’d? Do people look at you and say “he or she is Jesus’d!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Christ” is not His last name. It is His title in Greek. His title in Hebrew is “Messiah” – Jesus the Messiah and Jesus Christ both mean the same thing. Since He ministered to a Jewish culture, we encourage saying Jesus the Messiah. If you’re slightly more daring, you can even call him Yeshua HaMashiach! On a related note some people have websites telling others that Jesus is a pagan name related to Zeus. This is internet folklore. Yeshua to Ieasus to Jesus is a logical progression from Hebrew/Aramaic to Greek/Latin to English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luke 2:13-15&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!” When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 14 is known as the &lt;em&gt;Gloria&lt;/em&gt;, which is short for &lt;em&gt;Gloria in Excelsis Deo et in terra pax homínibus bonae voluntátis.&lt;/em&gt; In Latin or English, Luke 2:14 is a prominent fixture in both Catholic and Protestant liturgies, as well as a U2 single from 1981.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earthly choirs honored the emperor, and the current emperor Agustus is known for instituting the famous &lt;em&gt;pax romana.&lt;/em&gt; Luke is certainly contrasting the worldly king with all his pomp and circumstance with the true king in a lowly manger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image12.png&#34; style=&#34;width:5.12855in;height:4.70935in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shepherds travelled some unstated distance to Bethlehem. Bolen: The traditional location of Shepherds’ Fields to the east of the village of Bethlehem is logical because sheep would graze beyond the area cultivated by farmers. As one goes to the east, the amount of rainfall quickly drops off, making it unproductive for agriculture.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen 37:11&lt;/sup&gt; And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener notes, “Bethlehem was not a large town. The shepherds probably checked the animal stables one by one until they found the one with the baby.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christmyth: Jesus was not univerally rejected at His Birth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the Christmyth that Jesus entered the world rejected and despised, the evidence suggests the opposite. His birth was heralded by the highest angels and praised by lowest shepherds. He was welcomed and celebrated. Next, we’ll see how Jesus was praised in the temple by a devout priest and a humble prophetess. Luke will end the chapter by saying “And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man” (Luke 2:52).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;And at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Luk 1:59&lt;/sup&gt; And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child. And they would have called him Zechariah after his father…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image13.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:35%;float:right&#34; /&gt;As we reviewed at the end of Matthew 1, circumcisions were on the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day as specified in the Torah, and this is when the newborn child was named. Luke 2:21 corresponds with Matthew 1:25. Note the shepherds&amp;rsquo; story comes BEFORE Luke 2:21 and the Magi story comes AFTER Matthew 1:25. Our next Christmyth buster is that the Magi were not there with the shepherds, but came after, apparently as late as two years after, Jesus’ birth. We’ll unpack this more in the next lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;And when the time came for their purification according to the Law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, “Every male who first opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord”) and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord, “a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Exo 13:2&lt;/sup&gt; “Consecrate to me all the firstborn. Whatever is the first to open the womb among the people of Israel, both of man and of beast, is mine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Lev 12:2-4, 8&lt;/sup&gt; “Speak to the people of Israel, saying, If a woman conceives and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean seven days. As at the time of her menstruation, she shall be unclean. [3] And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. [4] Then she shall continue for thirty-three days in the blood of her purifying. She shall not touch anything holy, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying are completed. (8) And if she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves or two pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a purification offering. And the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Num 18:16&lt;/sup&gt; And their redemption price (at a month old you shall redeem them) you shall fix at five shekels in silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ parents fulfill the Jewish Law properly. Jesus had to perfectly keep the law in order to be the Messiah. Even when He is physically unable to do so by His own means, his parents do what is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two different rituals going on here at the same time: the offering of the firstborn and the required ritual purification of a mother after she gives birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering for the firstborn was done after the 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day (traditionally the 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; day), while the purification was done after 40 days. They either did both at the same time or stayed in Jerusalem between the 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; and 41&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; days. If Luke is being fully precise in his chronology, it appears that both offerings may have been on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the text mentions both, it’s curious that the recorded offering in verses 22-24 deals ONLY with the purification procedure, not the firstborn redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;purification-of-mary&#34;&gt;Purification of Mary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While giving birth is not a sin, according to the Torah, it rendered a woman in an unclean state. Being unclean is a temporary status and is not the same as sinning. Many times, an unclean status was not avoidable. Mary and Joseph followed the required offering to purify Mary from her unclean status. Offering two pigeons or two turledoves the provision for those who couldn’t afford a lamb, according to Leviticus 12:1-8. This indicates they were poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;redemption-of-the-firstborn-son&#34;&gt;Redemption of the Firstborn Son&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The redemption of the firstborn is directly tied to the Levitical priesthood. The father typically handed the baby boy to a priest, and say, “This is my firstborn son, and the Holy One, blessed be He, has commanded me to redeem him.” The priest then says, “Which do you prefer, to give away your firstborn son to me, or to redeem him for five shekels as you are required by the Torah?” The father then typically replies, “I wish to redeem my son; I present you with the cost of his redemption.” The father pays, then the priest takes the child in his arms, blesses him, then hands the child back to the father.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s reasonable to conclude Joseph paid the five shekels (or some equivalent provision for the poor), but Luke doesn’t mention this. Another way to look at it is that the Holy Spirit edited that out. During the Genealogies lessons, we learned we want to ask “why” whenever the Holy Spirit includes a seemingly unnecessary detail. Here we need to ask the same question when the Holy Spirit omits a seemingly critical detail. When we dig a little we are rewarded with insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;More &amp;lsquo;Holy Spirit editing&amp;rsquo; in Genesis 22&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The classic example of an obvious &amp;ldquo;omission&amp;rdquo; that results in a deeper spiritual point is Genesis 22:19 &lt;em&gt;So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham lived at Beersheba&lt;/em&gt;. This is immediately after the Angel stopped Abraham from sacrificing Isaac. After the promise given to Abraham in verses 16-18, it’s reasonable to conclude that BOTH Abraham AND ISAAC, descended the mountain and return to Abraham’s young men who were watching the donkeys in 22:5. But Isaac is not mentioned here. He is not mentioned again until after being united with Rebekah in Gen 24:62. If we think in types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abraham is a type of the Father who sacrificed His Son.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaac is a type of Jesus who “disappears” after being “sacrificed.” He remains “hidden” until he is united with His bride. It gets better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rebekah is that gentile bride who agrees to be wed to a groom she has never seen.  She is a type of the Church.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of this is orchestrated by a servant whose name means God’s Helper. The servant is a type of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have the Father, Son, Spirit, and gentile church all in view in Genesis 22 and 24. The typology doesn’t work unless Isaac is somehow edited out of the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Luke’s case, if we look ahead to the end of the story, there are any number of reasonable applications as to why the five shekels “wasn’t paid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus lived His life in service of God, just as if He had been handed to the temple priest for lifetime service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus WILL pay the price to be the “Firstborn of All creation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is the one who will redeem us; He is not the One who needs to be redeemed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is a priest in the order of Melchizedek, not Levi. Heb 7:11 Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, rather than one named after the order of Aaron?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luke 2:25-28&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Christ. And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the Law, he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Act 1:6&lt;/sup&gt; So when they had come together, they asked him, “Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another facet that is logical but isn’t obvious is that according to verse 27, Simeon was the priest officiating the firstborn ceremony. The Holy Family had entered the court of Women in the Temple looking for a priest to officiate. At the same time, Simeon’s eyes were drawn to the family and made himself available for service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is another Jewish person described by Luke as righteous and devout. He also has the Holy Spirit upon him. Here is another Jew who lived in expectation of the coming of Messiah and recognized Him when He arrived. We all should be seeing how the actual words of the Bible are often in conflict with popular New Testament theology concerning the Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll come back to Acts 1:6 when we meet Anna, the prophetess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;“Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace, according to your word; for my eyes have seen your salvation that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel.” And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen 46:30&lt;/sup&gt; Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me die, since I have seen your face and know that you are still alive.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Psa 98:2&lt;/sup&gt; The LORD has made known his salvation; he has revealed his righteousness in the sight of the nations (Gentiles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 42:6&lt;/sup&gt; “I am the LORD; I have called you in righteousness; I will take you by the hand and keep you; I will give you as a covenant for the people, a light for the nations (gentiles),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 46:13&lt;/sup&gt; I bring near my righteousness; it is not far off, and my salvation will not delay; I will put salvation in Zion, for Israel my glory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 2 has the last two of the seven oracles. We looked at the first five in Luke 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annunciation of John - 1:13-17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annunciation of Jesus to Mary - 1:30:37&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blessings of Elizabeth - 1:42-45&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Magnificat - 1:46-55&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Benedictus - 1:68-80&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nunc Dimittis 2:29:32&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary’s Sword - 2:34-25&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars believe the Nunc Dimittis became a part of early church liturgy along with the Magnificat and Benedictus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we see the deliberate pun on salvation and Yeshua. Simeon also revealed that Gentiles were included in the Messianic plan. In this respect, Simeon is possibly a foreshadow of Simon Peter, who, after some convincing, also proclaimed this message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are at least eight references to the Hebrew Bible in this short oracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;oracle-7--marys-sword&#34;&gt;Oracle #7 – Mary’s Sword&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, “Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Num 6:24&lt;/sup&gt; The LORD bless you and keep you;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 8:14-15&lt;/sup&gt; And he will become a sanctuary and a stone of offense and a rock of stumbling to both houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And many shall stumble on it. They shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and taken.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mar 12:10&lt;/sup&gt; Have you not read this Scripture: “‘The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rom 9:33&lt;/sup&gt; as it is written, “Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense; and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blessing in verse 34 is likely the &lt;em&gt;v’arevecha&lt;/em&gt;, the priestly benediction, from Numbers 6. We’re speculating but as this is directed to Mary, potentially, Simeon handed Jesus to Mary instead of Joseph as he spoke these words. This would have been unusual (the baby was supposed to be handed back to the father according to tradition) but this could be a hint that Simeon knew that Joseph was not the father in the usual sense and/or b) giving Jesus to Mary would have underscored the severity of Simeon’s words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After six oracles promising joy and salvation, this seventh turns dark and unsettling.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is the first indication of pain in the Gospel story. Simeon prophecies the division Messiah will cause, leading to His death. Israel’s rejection of Messiah will be nearly overwhelming for Mary. A “sword piercing a soul” is a Talmudic idiom for “wish I were dead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luke 2:36-38&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years from when she was a virgin, and then as a widow until she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day. And coming up at that very hour she began to give thanks to God and to speak of him to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Act 5:42&lt;/sup&gt; And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and preaching that the Messiah is Jesus.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t sure why, but Luke doesn’t record what she said. First, it’s interesting that Luke notes she is from the tribe of Asher. Asher was one of the ten northern tribes that was taken into captivity by the Assyrians in 721 BC. This has led to the so-called “ten lost tribes” myth. Apparently Anna was not lost. When we get to Revelation and the sealing of the 144,000, some wonder how we can take the “12,000” from each of the 12 tribes literally if ten of the tribes are supposedly lost. Luke is telling us that God knows exactly where His people are. If you’re feeling distant from God, God is not the one who moved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anna or channa in Hebrew, means “grace” or “favor,” so whatever she said likely provided some comfort after Simeon’s dark predictions. She was married for seven years, then became a widow. Rather than remarry, she elected to devote her remaining years to the service of the Lord. Her devotion foreshadows the earlier Jewish believers who will meet in the Temple every day to proclaim Jesus after His Ascension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that Simeon, Anna and the Jewish apostles in Acts 1:6 who were expecting Jesus to redeem Israel and Jerusalem weren’t wrong. When we get to Acts 1, we are often taught by well-intended teachers something along the lines of, “those dense apostles. Even after all Jesus taught, they STILL didn’t understand how wrong they were. Once again, Jesus has to set them straight.” As we will be fond of pointing out, Acts 1:7 and 1:8 does not support any type of correction or rebuke. In fact, Jesus doesn’t even disagree with the assumptions behind their question. He merely says, “It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.” (Acts 1:7-8). The Redemption Simeon and Anna were waiting for will happen, but it will be on God’s timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, in Luke’s narrative, the Holy Family returns to Nazareth. Matthew records that they had some other adventures first. We’ll look at those in the next lesson called “the Nazarene.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practically every waking moment of our lives, we are making choices.  What should I do next, or which option should I pick?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these involve mundane tasks.  Should I take out the trash or do the dishes?  Sometimes we artificially limit ourselves.  Which show should I watch?  Well, who says you need to watch anything (unless it’s talmidim way videos)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other choices can have spiritual significance, and some may even have eternal consequences. We need to ask ourselves, “By this choice, am I living for God or living for myself?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a town in the Bible that was the location of many monumental, life-changing decisions. Let’s explore inSIGHTS from the location of one of Jesus’ most famous interactions: Shechem and Jacob’s well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lesson will discuss the structure of each of the Seven Letters.  We will also review several approaches to application including three conjectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our fifth lesson in Revelations backgrounds will introduce the seven letters in chapters 2-3. Each letter follows an intricate and nearly identical outline. Understanding this at the outset will help us as we seek to unpack each letter. Next, we will look at several application layers and the commonly taught &amp;ldquo;church age&amp;rdquo; conjecture. We will also look at the often confusing and misunderstood phrases, &amp;ldquo;the Nicolaitans,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;those who say they are Jews but are not,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the synagogue of Satan.&amp;rdquo; Since these phrases occur in multiple letters, we will deal with them upfront. Ultimately Scripture does not define these. We will strive to leverage what we ARE told from Scripture &amp;ndash; and we do get some clues &amp;ndash; with what was going on in that society at the time to make an educated guess that may be different from what is commonly taught. Acts 17:11 says, don&amp;rsquo;t take my word for it but test these theories to see whether these things could be so. As we mentioned in an earlier lesson, our job is not to tell you WHAT to think. It&amp;rsquo;s to get you TO think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-sevenfold-structure-of-each-letter&#34;&gt;The Sevenfold Structure of Each Letter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will find that the letters follow a sequence of seven elements. 1. Name of the city (addressee), 2. An attribute of the Glorified Messiah from 1:12-20 (addresser), 3. Praise that usually begins with &amp;ldquo;I know…&amp;rdquo;, 4. Judgment, 5. Encouragement, 6. A promise to the overcomer, 7. &amp;ldquo;He who has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener notes: &amp;ldquo;Some scholars have compared the elements of the form to Old Testament and ancient Near Eastern covenant formulas; if they are correct, the prophecies here may act like the covenant lawsuits common in the Old Testament prophets (e.g., in Amos 2–4). They may also function analogously to a series of oracles against the nations common in the Old Testament prophets (e.g., Isaiah 13–23; Jer 46–51; Ezek 25–32; especially the eight brief oracles of Amos 1–2).&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We examine each element in greater detail and describe more about the judgment aspect, as commentators often overlook this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-name-of-the-city&#34;&gt;1. Name of the City&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; (1) &amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Ephesus, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message…&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first element is always addressed to the angel of the assembly at each of the cities. We&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in previous lessons that there is scholarly debate as to whether the angel is supernatural or is a human messenger. For our purposes, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter as the body of each letter deals with the behaviors of the human body of believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning of the city&amp;rsquo;s name often is revealing. For example, Ephesus means &amp;ldquo;darling&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;darling one,&amp;rdquo; yet this is the church that lost its first love, and the Greek word used is Agape, a completely devoted type of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we go through each city in subsequent Revelation Background lessons, we will present some of the background history, enhancing our understanding of what God communicates to the fellowship. Keener writes, &amp;ldquo;Ancient cities were fiercely proud of their own history and culture and would be more sensitive to local allusions than most readers today would be.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-a-specific-attribute-of-messiah&#34;&gt;2. A specific attribute of Messiah&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven gold menorahs: &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second element is a specific attribute of the one who is sending the letter. The speaker is never identified as Jesus, but we&amp;rsquo;ll say it&amp;rsquo;s Jesus the Messiah in his risen and glorified form even though we know John received the revelation through an angel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attributes typically tie back to the description of this heavenly being in Revelation 1:12-20. There is one slight deviation in the letter to Philadelphia where He says He has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens. Revelation 1:18 mentions the Keys to death and hades but not the Key of David. Any deviations should get our attention. We&amp;rsquo;ll unpack this when we get to Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-specific-praise-that-begins-with-i-know&#34;&gt;3. Specific Praise that begins with &amp;ldquo;I know….&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; (2) &amp;ldquo;I know what you have been doing, how hard you have worked, how you have persevered, and how you can&amp;rsquo;t stand wicked people; so you tested those who call themselves emissaries but aren&amp;rsquo;t—and you found them to be liars. (3) You are persevering, and you have suffered for my sake without growing weary. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third attribute in each letter is praise. If I read this like an audit report from my corporate auditing days, this would be an attribute that was tested and found to have met the standard. It is something Jesus approves of and encourages us to keep on doing. In some letters, it is apparent that something they think is wrong, Jesus believes is good. To Smyrna, Jesus writes, &amp;ldquo;I know your poverty, but you are rich.&amp;rdquo; They likely did not see themselves as rich, but Jesus says they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every letter follows this sevenfold structure, and it will get our attention when there are deviations. Two letters are conspicuous because they have no praise. These are the 5th and 7th letters: Sardis and Laodicea. Something is seriously wrong with these churches. We&amp;rsquo;ll find out what those things are when we get to those cities. We also note that the &amp;ldquo;I know&amp;rdquo; beginning now precedes the judgment for these two assemblies.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-judgment&#34;&gt;4. Judgment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; (4) But I have this against you: you have lost the love you had at first. (5) Therefore, remember where you were before you fell, turn from this sin, and do what you used to do before. Otherwise, I will come to you and remove your menorah from its place—if you don&amp;rsquo;t turn from your sin! &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth element of Jesus&amp;rsquo; report card is what we might benignly call an improvement opportunity, although we must note Jesus uses much harsher words. This is God pronouncing a judgment. In the example of Ephesus, their deficiency, loss of the love they had at first, is nothing less than a sin which they must repent of at the expense of losing their light. And since Jesus is in the midst of that light, He&amp;rsquo;s saying he&amp;rsquo;s going to remove Ephesus from his midst. That&amp;rsquo;s serious. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a C on the report card; it&amp;rsquo;s not even an F. It&amp;rsquo;s a zero. It&amp;rsquo;s so severe that many commentators believe a loss of salvation is in view for people who don&amp;rsquo;t repent (or we could say people who don&amp;rsquo;t repent even after Jesus tells them to do not show evidence of saving faith).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are very analogous to the judgment pronouncements in the Old Testament. One of the more familiar of these is Jonah. Jonah was called to go to Nineveh, the hated and brutal regime of the day, and pronounce a judgment. He didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go, which was a whale of a tale. Ba-dum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message Jonah was to deliver was that the all-knowing, all-powerful God of Israel knows what wickedness has been occurring in Ninevah, and His patience is not infinite. Judgment is coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judgments like these usually have an expressed or implied safety valve. If the recipient repents, the Judgment will be withheld. We see that in this letter to Ephesus. &amp;ldquo;Remember where you were, repent, and do what you used to do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonah didn&amp;rsquo;t even get to this part of his oracle to Nineveh. The town&amp;rsquo;s leaders understood that repenting was the only way to avert disaster. Which they did, causing Jonah to pout some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who teach that the God of the Old Testament is vengeful and judgmental while the God of the New is all about grace have apparently never read Revelation 2 and 3. They probably have not read much of the Old Testament either. We see God&amp;rsquo;s grace and mercy at the very beginning in the Garden of Eden. God is most gracious, most merciful, and cannot tolerate sin. All are true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as two churches had no praise, two other churches, Smyrna and Philadelphia, have no deficiency. This is one reason everyone wants to think they are part of the church of Philadelphia (but remember, the difference between how we see ourselves and how Jesus sees us is a significant theme throughout each letter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of personal application, if any of Jesus&amp;rsquo; words of judgment to the seven assemblies pinch us a little, we need to repent and get that corrected. As a talmid, I must serve at His pleasure faithfully. If He tells me I need to improve, I know I better improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-encouragement&#34;&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Encouragement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; (6) But you have this in your favor: you hate what the Nicolaitans do—I hate it too. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5th element is encouragement, or, we might say, additional (or secondary) praise. Jesus will follow up his condemnation with a note of encouragement. In some cases, the secondary encouragement is directed to a specific subset of the congregation where perhaps only a few are doing the thing Jesus approves of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We mentioned Sardis and Laodicea do not have any praise. Sardis still has an encouragement that is extremely limited in its scope. For Laodicea, the encouragement takes a different form of a plea, which we&amp;rsquo;ll get to down the road. Pergamum has praise, but they get no secondary encouragement statement. Again, exceptions to the usual pattern need to get our attention. Something is very wrong at Pergamum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the general rule is a 2:1 ratio of praise and encouragement to deficiencies. If your job involves supervising others, auditing, or parenting, this is great to remember. It indicates the deliverer of the bad news cares about the recipients and is not just being a disciplinarian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-promise-to-the-overcomer&#34;&gt;6. Promise to the Overcomer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; To him winning the victory I will give the right to eat from the Tree of Life which is in God&amp;rsquo;s Gan-`Eden.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many translations have &amp;ldquo;to the overcomer.&amp;rdquo; Stern borrows from Paul and phrases it, &amp;ldquo;to him winning the victory.&amp;rdquo; The book of Revelation is about being an overcomer. The entire Christian walk of discipleship (the &amp;ldquo;talmidim way&amp;rdquo;) is about being an overcomer. Romans 12:2 says, &amp;quot; Do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does raise some interesting theological questions. Most commentators assume the letters are addressed to believers. If so, is Jesus saying that there will be some believers who will NOT be overcomers? If so, in Ephesus&amp;rsquo; case, does that mean there will be believers who do not eat from the Tree of Life?&amp;rdquo; Other commentators see this promise as a forfeit of rewards, not salvation. The counterargument is that eating the tree of life appears to be the only way to avoid the second death. How can one say that one is saved if one can&amp;rsquo;t eat the Tree of Life and avoid the second death? Dr. Fruchtenbaum has what may be a more straightforward rationale. Many assume these letters are written to believers only. Fruchtenbaum points out that these 1st-century fellowships probably had unbelievers alongside believers, just like today&amp;rsquo;s congregations. This may have included some intentional imposters that slipped in as well as people who sincerely believe they are saved, but to whom Jesus will say, &amp;ldquo;depart from me. I never knew you.&amp;rdquo; The overcomers would be those who are genuinely saved, and the non-overcomers would be unsaved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entire debate is easily solved by putting our trust in Jesus. He said, &amp;ldquo;if you love Me, keep my commands.&amp;rdquo; One of His commands is to abide in Him. If we abide in Him and help others do the same, then whether the manmade doctrine of eternal security is true is ultimately relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;7-he-who-has-an-ear&#34;&gt;7. He who has an ear&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;(7) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the Messianic communities.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last component is every letter will have this identical phrase &amp;ldquo;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies or churches&amp;rdquo; This is an exciting statement. Each letter begins directed to a specific congregation, but each ends with an individual application (you and I have ears to hear) and application to all churches. He didn&amp;rsquo;t say here what the spirit is saying to &amp;ldquo;Ephesus&amp;rdquo;; he said Hear what the spirit is saying to the communities. OR your bible probably has &amp;ldquo;what the Spirit says to the churches&amp;rdquo; plural. We&amp;rsquo;ll talk more about the application in the next section. This is a warning for all believers to hear and obey Jesus&amp;rsquo; words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have 6 and 7 flipped intentionally because the promise comes first in the last four letters, and the letter closes with &amp;ldquo;he who has an ear.&amp;rdquo; The first three are like Ephesus; he who has an ear is followed by the promise. We aren&amp;rsquo;t told from the text why this is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of my professional career first auditing then running audit and monitoring programs. These letters read very much like an audit report - you have the &amp;ldquo;to&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;from,&amp;rdquo; and as auditors, we always give our credentials. Credentials are what makes us an expert in the field. Jesus is giving his judgment credentials. We then present those items that met the standard and those deficiencies that require remediation or corrective action (deficiencies noted were judgments of sorts). Those would be sections 3, 4, and 5of each letter. Then there is always a section on the next steps - we&amp;rsquo;ll recommend to the board that you&amp;rsquo;re good to go for another three years, or maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll recommend to operations that if they can&amp;rsquo;t fix the problem, they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be in the business. I see that as roughly equivalent to the promise to the overcomer. (I never said, &amp;ldquo;if you have eyes to see, you must read my report,&amp;rdquo; but I wish I could have).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;application&#34;&gt;Application&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four surface layers of application and another three within the realm of conjecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four obvious levels are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal (he that has an ear…)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The specific local assembly and its attendees (to the assembly at Ephesus)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All seven assemblies and their attendees (hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All congregations throughout history (hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 21st century, the personal application is the most important. We must resist the temptation to say that each judgment is only for that 1st-century church or some other church I’m not attending. We must make it personal. Let&amp;rsquo;s do some introspective digging. What areas might we need to improve or even repent of in our lives to align them with Jesus&amp;rsquo; expectations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe the fourth application is valid because there appear to be components in some of the letters that go beyond the local situation and, in some cases, do not appear to apply to the local situation at all. We will highlight these as we get to the specifics of each letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three additional parallels certain scholars have noted. Some connections can be strained in places but, in general, may have value and hint at supernatural design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pauline letter counterpart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matthew 13 parable counterpart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Church Age theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pauline-letter-counterpart&#34;&gt;Pauline letter counterpart&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul also wrote to seven cities (Rome, Corinth, Galatia, Ephesus, Philippi, Colossae, Thessaloniki). The themes in Paul&amp;rsquo;s letters seem to parallel the Seven Letters of Revelation broadly.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later we will look at a passage from Ephesians that appears to fit what we know about Ephesus and applies to the local situation. Ephesus and Laodicea are mentioned explicitly in Ephesians and Colossians, respectively, so those two are natural parings with Jesus&amp;rsquo; letters to Ephesus and Laodicea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also see that Philippians share some themes with Smyrna&amp;rsquo;s letter regarding suffering. Pergamum talks about a carnal church that&amp;rsquo;s married to the world. Is there a city Paul wrote to that struggled with this? Yep. Corinth. Scholars see connections with Thyatira and Sardis to Galatians and Romans. In some cases, these two can be reversed. Linking Sardis to Romans draws on the Church Age theory discussed below. Philadelphia is the church where everything is going well. Is there a church Paul wrote to where the bulk of the letter is praise and encouragement? That would be Thessalonians. Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s interesting even if they aren&amp;rsquo;t perfect fits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ephesus - Ephesians 4:17-32 parallels Jesus&amp;rsquo; words to Ephesus - Eph 4:14  so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smyrna - Philippians - Joy through suffering - Php 1:29  For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake / Php 4:4  Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pergamum - Corinthians - Married to the world - 1Co 5:1  It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thyatira - Galatians - Religious externalism themes - Gal 1:6  I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sardis - Romans - Don&amp;rsquo;t know they are dead / don&amp;rsquo;t walk the talk - Rom 3:10-12  as it is written: “None is righteous, no, not one;  (11)  no one understands; no one seeks for God.  (12)  All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Philadelphia - Thessalonians - praiseworthy fellowships - 1Th 2:19  For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laodicea - Colossians - Lukewarm/told to exchange letters - Col 3:2  Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;matthew-13-parable-counterpart&#34;&gt;Matthew 13 Parable counterpart&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the parables, it’s the same general thought. Thyatira deals with a woman Jezebel. Is there a woman featured in one of the parables? Yes - it&amp;rsquo;s the woman with the leaven, a type of sin. To Laodicea, Jesus says he will &amp;ldquo;spew&amp;rdquo; them out of his mouth. Is there a parable that deals with rejecting and casting out? That would be the parable of the Dragnet where the good fish are kept, and the rotten fish are cast away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the Pauline letter counterparts, some connections may be strained. If nothing else, doing Acts 17:11 diligence will cause us to look into Paul&amp;rsquo;s letters and Matthew&amp;rsquo;s parables to see whether these things be so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ephesians - Four soils - identify believers from unbelievers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smyrna - Tares and the wheat - Suffering by the children of the wicked one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pergamum - Mustard Seed - Becomes something it was never intended to be; the birds of the air (ministers of Satan) can nest inside&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thyatira - Woman with Leaven - Only letter/parable that mentions a woman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sardis - Treasure in the field - a few in Sardis will have treasure in heaven&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Philadelphia - Pearl of Great Price - A pearl is an item of adornment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laodicea - Dragnet - spew/cast out the unwanted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;church-age-theory&#34;&gt;Church Age Theory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some scholars make a big deal about the church age theory, but it&amp;rsquo;s not without issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outset, the most common version of the theory holds that all types of churches were always present and, for the most part, are present today. The church assigned to the age happens to be the dominant or at least the predominant church of that given period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ephesus - Apostolic - 70-170&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smyrna - Persecuted - 170 -312&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pergamum - Compromised/Licentious (married to the world) - 312 - 606
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What Satan couldn&amp;rsquo;t destroy by persecution, he tried to kill by erosion from within&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christianity became the state religion under Constantine II - went from pacifist to conquering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byzantine period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thyatira - Papal (Catholic) Church - 606- Present
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boniface II first universal Pope in 606&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tolerate Jezebel - pagan/non-biblical practices infiltrate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medieval period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sardis - Protestant Church - 1517-Present
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NAME (deNOMination) that they are alive but are dead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reformation/Enlightenment period (95 Theses 1517)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Philadelphia - Missionary/Faithful - 1750-Present
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A time when doors were open to the spread of the Gospel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, it corresponds to freedom movements in America, France, and elsewhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It tends to be &amp;ldquo;The church I am attending&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laodicea - Comfortable/Lukewarm - 1900-Present
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short sermons and comfy chairs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sincerely half-hearted believers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conforms to society&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It tends to be &amp;ldquo;The church someone I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with is attending&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we can say that all churches were always present. We know for a fact that Laodicea was present in the apostolic age; Jesus said so! Also, today, which would be the Laodicean age, many Christians worldwide are persecuted the way Smyrna was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unquestionably, this interpretation would not have occurred to John or the original audience, so we need to tread lightly. One issue is it is only limited to the western/European church (to be precise, the churches founded in lands occupied by the western part of the Roman empire and its successors). The eastern faith traditions are not present, many of which are very different from ours. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to find a slot for the Egyptian Coptics, Armenian Orthodox, or African variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the theory applied today results in a bit of &amp;ldquo;us and them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every believer sees him or herself as part of the church of Philadelphia (the missionary and faithful church) and anyone they disagree with as part of the church of Laodicea (the apostate church).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the themes of the letters is how we see ourselves and how Jesus sees us are not necessarily aligned - so many who think they are Philadelphia may not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if every church today is either Laodicea or Philadelphia, we would have only needed two churches in Revelation, not seven. We&amp;rsquo;ll touch on this but hold to it lightly as we go through each city. It&amp;rsquo;s much more vital that we look ourselves in the mirror as we read each letter than categorize different churches according to the Church Age Theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In THE NAZARENE, Joseph and Mary return to the remote village of Nazareth overlooking the Jezreel Valley and Mount Tabor. The transition from cosmopolitan Alexandria to backwater Nazareth allows them to live out their own personal exodus from Egypt. Every year at Passover, the family joins other Galileans to make the pilgrimage to Jerusalem for the festival. Twelve-year-old Yeshua is reluctant to leave His Father’s house in the holy city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:75%; float:right&#34; /&gt;Matthew’s narrative includes the visit of the Magi from the “east” – scholars think it’s either Parthia/Persia or Arabia. In general, the Euphrates separated the Parthian from the Roman empire. Frankincense and Myrrh are associated more with Arabia, but this doesn’t mean the Magi had to come from Arabia, although they certainly could have. We’re going to see that Herod and all Jerusalem was in an uproar, which to some suggests Herod may have thought a Parthian invasion was imminent. (Three guys on camels would not cause an uproar, but we’ll bust that Christ myth a bit later!). After the Magi’s visit, the Holy Family flees to Egypt. We aren’t told where, but Alexandria is a fair assumption because of the significant Jewish population there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.png&#34; style=&#34;width:60%; float:right&#34; /&gt;In a sense the whole bible is about usurpers, starting back in Genesis 3 with the serpent tricking man into thinking that our way is better than God’s way. That deception still continues, not only in the geopolitical world around us but also within us individually. Herod is the phony king of the Jews who isn’t even Jewish, while Jesus is the rightful one who is BORN king of the Jews. Herod represents darkness while Jesus represents light. At this point in Matthew 2, the evil king is hunting down Yeshua, who must relocate to safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe Old Testament Joseph traveled along the Via Maris, the way of the sea, while Jacob and his family traveled along the way of the Patriarchs to Beersheba and then on down to Egypt. Given that Bethlehem lies along the way of the patriarchs, it’s reasonable to suspect the Holy Family used the same road as Jacob when they fled to Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Magi are said to depart from Bethlehem a different way, which is to say they did not go back through Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herod died in 4 BC. After the sojourn in Egypt, the text appears their first choice would have been to go back to Bethlehem however the political situation – and the holy spirit – directed them back to Nazareth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archelaus, who was now over Judea and Samaria (including Jerusalem) was every bit as ruthless as his father Herod was. He was so awful that Rome replaced him in AD 6 with the procurators. The procurator we know best is Pontius Pilate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archelaus’ brother Antipas was over Galilee and Perea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Matthew 2, whenever we read “Herod” or “Herod the Tetrarch” without further designation, that is referring to Herod Antipas. Antipas is the Herod at the end of Jesus’ life who asks for a miracle. When Jesus stays silent (Refusing to acknowledge his authority), Antipas mocks him and sends him back to Pilate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, “Where is he who has been born king of the &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt;? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Num 24:17&lt;/sup&gt; I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near: a star shall come out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel; it shall crush the forehead of Moab and break down all the sons of Sheth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen 3:15&lt;/sup&gt; I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 2:6&lt;/sup&gt; For you have rejected your people, the house of Jacob, because they are full of things from the east&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magi were gentile/ pagan astrologers whose divinatory skills were widely respected in the Greco-Roman world; astrology had become popular through the “science” of the East. According to Keener, “everyone agreed that the best astrologers lived in the East.” Isaiah acknowledges this in Isa 2:6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have mentioned, there is a possible dig at Herod when they ask, “where is He that is BORN king of the Jews?”. Herod was appointed by Rome. They could be saying “where is the REAL king?” Even if they didn’t mean it as an insult, it is likely Herod took it as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That messiah would be signified by a star goes back to Numbers 24 and a prophecy by Balaam, also a gentile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Matthew’s points is that gentiles who would otherwise have no interest in a Jewish messiah make the trek across the lands to come bow to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Him, while in verse 5, the religious who should worship the messiah do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we move through the Gospels, we’ll encounter a terminology problem with the word translated as “Jews” in our Bibles. For us 2000 years later, it can be difficult without additional context. Sometimes the Jews are all Jewish people in the first century and other times they are a specific subset, such as the corrupt political elite. Some speculate it would only take as few as 20 or 30 people to engineer the plot to arrest and kill Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use “Americans” the same way, but we usually understand the meaning from the context. “The Americans invaded Afghanistan” versus “Americans have specific rights outlined in the constitution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remind us that we need to ask ourselves this question and not immediately assume all Jews, I will use the Greek term &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt;. In this context in Matthew 2, &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; means all Jews. In the next lesson, we will see that this term refers to a very small subset of temple-establishment types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 2:3-4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, &lt;strong&gt;and all Jerusalem with him&lt;/strong&gt;; and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:60%; float:right&#34; /&gt;As we said earlier, it could have been a threat of military incursion from Parthia or it could simply be a situation of “if Herod isn’t happy, then ain’t nobody happy,” While Herod provided many jobs with his building projects, overall it is safe to say he was hated. Rumors of a prophesied new king could have spread quickly throughout Jerusalem&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and many would have been ready to join a political incursion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve looked at Bethlehem in the Annunciations video so this is just a refresher. Bethlehem is about 4-5 miles from Jerusalem. The main road in the centre of the slide is roughly the same road since antiquity, the Way of the Patriarchs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeshua was born&lt;/strong&gt; between 8 and 4 B.C.E&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The reason he was born &amp;ldquo;B.C.&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;Before Christ&amp;rdquo;) is that Dionysius Exiguus, the sixth century monk who set up the modern calendar, made a mistake in determining the date which was not corrected till later.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Though he died in the early days of the New Testament period, King Herod left a significant mark on the land of Israel for decades to come. His structures at Masada still cause visitors to marvel.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herod was paranoid about his power and was known to eliminate any potential threats, including those of his own family. He built palaces such as Masada in case he needed to flee in the event of a revolt. Ironically Masada has become a symbol of Jewish freedom and independence similar to what the Alamo in Texas means to Texans. Near the very end of the first Jewish Revolt (66-72) a band of Jewish rebels made this their last stand against the Romans. As the Romans were about to breach the walls, Josephus records that they committed mass suicide instead of becoming slaves (well the men would have been killed and the women and children would have been slaves.) To this day one of the mottos of the Israeli Defense Forces is “Masada shall never fall again.” Several IDF units hold their swearing-in ceremonies at Masada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one of Herod’s grand construction projects was the city of Caesarea. Here he constructed a palace, theater, temple, and harbor. Caesarea is the location where the Gospel first went out to the Gentiles. Acts 12 records that Herod Agrippa died in the theater&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have several issues with our traditional representation of the wise men versus what the Bible actually says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bible does not record that the shepherds and the wise men visited Jesus at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time the wise men show up, they are in a House in Bethlehem, not a manger. Judging by the decree to kill the boys 2 years and younger, this visit could have happened up to two years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shepherds did not see a star, the Magi did&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the time of year is not mentioned and December is an unlikely month to bring a caravan across the desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Bible does not say there were three wise men. In fact, &amp;ldquo;all Jerusalem was in an uproar.&amp;rdquo; It is highly unlikely that three guys on camels could have caused this. The people possibly were fearing a Parthenian military incursion which means this could have been an entire entourage, such as one sent in advance to spell out the terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magi were pagan astrologers; in that day, “astrology” was more of a “hard science” than we consider it today. Even though these Magi were Pagan, God had chosen to reveal himself to them. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a tradition that Daniel put all this in motion when he was placed in an executive leadership role in Daniel 6. That they saw “his star” could be a reference to Numbers 24:17, where Balaam, also a gentile like the Magi were, said “There shall come forth a star out of Jacob.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;They told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet: “‘And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.’”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mic 5:2&lt;/sup&gt; But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2Sa 5:2&lt;/sup&gt; And the LORD said to (David), ‘You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over Israel.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener notes that the scribes had head knowledge that Messiah was to be born in Bethlehem and received a potential sign from God that this birth had occurred, yet they did nothing with it (either positively has the Magi did or negatively, as Herod will do in verse 16). There’s a huge difference in knowing about Jesus and knowing Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve talked in previous videos about Matthew’s editing, very loose paraphrasing, and broad interpretation of Old Testament prophecies, to the point where he is clearly taking them out of context. “You will shepherd my people Israel,” which is found in 2 Samuel 5:2, isn’t even a prophecy but more of a commission to David. While it seems strange to us and would not be acceptable by today’s academic standards of exegesis, it was very consistent with rabbinic exegesis of the day. Matthew is using the text of 2 Samuel 5:2 as what is called a “midrash” which serves to expand on Micah 5:2, Lancaster rephrases this as, “The ruler coming forth from Bethlehem is Messiah, Son of David who will shepherd Israel just as David of Bethlehem did.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a fair question to ask why the Magi went to Jerusalem if the Messiah was prophesied to be born in Bethlehem. It’s logical for the Magi to assume the messiah would have been born in Jerusalem, and possibly been one of Herod’s sons. Also, Bethlehem and Jerusalem are only a few miles apart. When they go to Bethlehem Luke records that a star will guide thim; this is reminiscent of the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night that guided the children of Israel in the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;th&gt;Matthew 2:7-8&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared. And he sent them to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bethlehem, saying, “Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 2:6 For you have rejected your people, the house of Jacob, because they are full of things from the east and of fortune-tellers like the Philistines, and they strike hands with the children of foreigners.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of reacting favorably to the news the Messiah was born, Herod, like most other pagan rulers of his day attempted to divine from the stars things pertaining to the fate of his kingdom. The problem is such divination was forbidden for Jews in Deuteronomy 18. Here Isaiah makes an interesting statement that God’s people look to “things from the east and of fortune tellers.” this is exactly what Herod does even though He’s just been read Micah 5:2. The ancients thought comets and falling stars predicted the fall of rulers; some emperors even banished from Rome astrologers who issued such predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: Herod has no intention of Worshipping Jesus. He never hesitated to murder anyone whom he saw as a threat to his throne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Magi traveled six miles (10 km) south from Jerusalem to Bethlehem. Since some time had apparently passed (up to two years), and verse 11 mentions the “house” where Jesus’s family was staying, it is likely that they had moved from the place where Jesus was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col style=&#34;width: 50%&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;After listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And going into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh. And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to &lt;strong&gt;Egypt&lt;/strong&gt;, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 60:5-6&lt;/sup&gt; The wealth of the nations shall come to you. A multitude of camels shall cover you, the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all those from Sheba shall come. They shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall bring good news, the praises of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Psa 45:8&lt;/sup&gt; your robes are all fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen 37:28&lt;/sup&gt; Then Midianite traders passed by. And they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. They took Joseph to Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three gifts are likely where we get the tradition of “three wise men”. Although we often picture treasure troves of gold being presented, Scripture doesn’t tell us how much gold was provided to them or what happened to it. We know that the offering of the two pigeons at the temple indicates Mary and Joseph were poor (although the Maji visit could have happened after Luke recorded that event at the temple). We get no indication that the family had any significant wealth either during Jesus’ childhood or after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myrrh had a number of uses, including incense (Exod 30:23), perfume (Ps 45:9), cosmetic (Esth 2:13), anesthetic (Mark 15:23), and embalming (John 19:39).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the main road in and out of town would have taken them directly through Jerusalem, they had to find another way. We don’t really know which way they went. Again, they likely had a large entourage, making clandestine travel difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to &lt;strong&gt;Egypt&lt;/strong&gt;, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen 37:28&lt;/sup&gt; Then Midianite traders passed by. And they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. They took Joseph to Egypt.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are literally over 100 different ways that the lives of Jacob’s son Joseph and Jesus are connected. Both not only had a sojourn in Egypt but both were also carried off at the hands of Ishmaelites. Edomites and Ishmaelites are interrelated. Joseph was carried by Ishmaelites while Jesus fled the hand of Herod the Edomite. In Gen 37:28 we also see that both were lowered and lifted out of a pit (Jesus when He was imprisoned by Caiaphas) and both were sold for pieces of silver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, “Out of Egypt I called my son.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Hosea 11:1-5&lt;/sup&gt; When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son. The more they were called, the more they went away; they kept sacrificing to the Baals and burning offerings to idols. Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk; I took them up by their arms, but they did not know that I healed them. I led them with cords of kindness, with the bands of love, and I became to them as one who eases the yoke on their jaws, and I bent down to them and fed them. They shall not return to the land of Egypt, but Assyria shall be their king, because they have refused to return to me.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect we can miss is when Jesus, Matthew or Luke references a small segment of one verse, the original audience would more than likely have understood the entire passage. To further complicate matters, sometimes the snippet the apostolic writer quotes may be relatively innocent sounding, but the underlying passage has an entirely different complexion. Such is the case here. First of all, Matthew is taking Hosea entirely out of context. That is not even up for debate. The point is that Jesus epitomizes and fulfills Israel’s history. Keener writes, “Isaiah narrows down the mission of Israel as a whole to the one who can ultimately fulfill that mission and suffer on behalf of the whole people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, there is nothing the slightest bit messianic about Hosea 11. We would be hard-pressed to call verses 1-4 prophecy. It is more of a lamentation. In verse 1, We can see it specifically refers to the nation Israel. Matthew is making a larger point. Just as Israel fled to and was called out from Egypt, so too it is with Messiah. Israel is God’s son; Messiah is God’s Son. Matthew was following common methods of Rabbinical interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part we miss is the entire passage of Hosea. Notice the sadness God has for his people who reject him despite his constant calling, healing, lovingkindness and provision. By the way, this is not just national Israel but you and me when we act ungrateful and stiff-necked. In context Hosea was written to the northern kingdom – because they refuse to serve the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and follow other gods, they will be forced to live under a despotic ruler, Assyria, just as generations before were slaves in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck Missler subtitled his verse-by-verse commentary on Hosea, “Hosea can you see.” His point was the warnings and lamentations God had for the northern kingdom apply to His people living in the United States who reject Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image5.png&#34; style=&#34;width:60%; float:right&#34; /&gt;Bolen notes that Joseph and Mary likely traveled west out of the hill country from Bethlehem and down to the Elah Valley shown in the photo&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. They may have followed a route running similar to the modern road that travels west through the valley. In this case, they would have traveled by the scene where David killed Goliath, perhaps considering that the child with them was the “son of David” who would defeat all of the enemies of God’s people in order to permanently establish the Lord’s kingdom on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other option is heading south through Hebron and down to Beersheba. In this case, I like to imagine the Holy Family thinking of Genesis 22, when God came through in a big way after Abraham nearly offered Isaac. Genesis 22:19 says that Abraham and his men returned to Beersheba. Either way, they would have recalled something miraculous that God did, just as he was doing in their own lives. This is the benefit of visiting Israel for us today. These stories jump off the black and white pages and seem more real somehow. A trip to the Holy Land strengthens our faith in a way that nothing else can.&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image6.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:60%; float:right&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This modern mosaic&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in the courtyard of the Hanging Church depicts Joseph, Mary, and baby Jesus traveling along the Nile River bank with the Great Pyramids of Giza in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very large Jewish community was in Egypt, particularly in Alexandria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Exo 1:22 Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, “Every son that is born to the Hebrews you shall cast into the Nile, but you shall let every daughter live.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t have any extrabiblical documentation of what is known as the slaughter of the innocents. “Following the Messiah” episode 1 has some interesting speculation on this if you are interested. Even biblical skeptics concede that this behavior of flying into a rage and ordering executions is entirely consistent with everything we know about Herod. Possibly the reason it escaped notice from historians is that we estimate the number of children killed was probably less than 30. This number is shocking to our ears, but Herod and the Romans who followed him didn’t hesitate to have hundreds executed at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, the parallel is there with Pharaoh who gave a similar command only to have God’s appointed deliverer miraculously escape the decree. Just as Moses was saved in the waters of the Nile, so too did Jesus escape across the Nile to safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The First century Jewish Historian Josephus records a legend, “One of the pharaoh’s sacred (astrologers) told the king that a child was about to be born to the Israelites, who, if allowed to live, would humble the kingdom of Egypt and exalt the Israelites. The King was so frightened that he commanded they should cast every male child born to the Israelites into the river and kill it.” Lancaster writes, “Matthew’s readers would have known this legend about the astrologers and the birth of Moses. They would have seen that the birth of Jesus followed the pattern set by Moses.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah: “A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be comforted because they are no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, “Rise, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child&#39;s life are dead.” And he rose and took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jer 31:15 Thus says the LORD: “A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted for her children, because they are no more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Exo 12:39&lt;/sup&gt; And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough that they had brought out of Egypt, for it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt and could not wait, nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bolen: “Archaeologists discovered the remains of Herod’s tomb in 2007. Most of it was destroyed, but experts were able to reconstruct it based upon the fragments found.” &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herod knew he was hated by the people who were likely to be very happy when he died. There’s a famous story that when Herod was about to die, he had several prominent and popular Jewish sages arrested. He gave orders that as soon as he died, the sages were to be murdered, thus causing the people to mourn “as such as never had any king before him; the nation would mourn from their very soul.” After he died, His sister Salome hurried to the prison and lied that Herod had ordered the sages released. All Israel now had two reasons to rejoice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of Galilee. And he went and lived in a city called Nazareth, so that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, that he would be called a Nazarene.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And when they had performed everything according to the Law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom. And the favor of God was upon him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 11:1&lt;/sup&gt; There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Zec 3:8&lt;/sup&gt; Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who sit before you, for they are men who are a sign: behold, I will bring my servant the Branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Jer 23:5&lt;/sup&gt; “Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface this prophecy by Matthew is puzzling. There is no passage in the Old Testament that says “He shall be called a Nazarene.” Therefore people conclude matthew was either misinformed or he fabricated the whole story. The key is understanding that the root word for Nazareth is Netzer, which means branch or sprout. This word is used in Isaiah 11:1. In Zechariah 3:8 and Jer 23:5 a synonym is used, Tzemach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In other words, Matthew is not referring to just one prophecy when he says “He shall be called a Nazarene,” nor is he quoting a particular passage. This is why he says “spoken by the prophet&lt;strong&gt;S”&lt;/strong&gt; In every other citation he uses prophet, singular but here he communicates the substance of several prophets.” COM 131&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image7.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:60%; float:right&#34; /&gt;As the holy family was in Egypt Jerusalem descended into chaos. Rome had ordered that her image of a golden eagle be hoisted above the Temple gates, which was a deliberate offense to the Jews who considered Herod complicit in the deed. Curiously this was a fulfilment of prophecy. Hosea 8:1: Hos 8:1 Set the trumpet to your lips! One like a vulture is over the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant and rebelled against my law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several devout believers scaled the Temple walls and threw down the eagle. Herod reacted with mass arrests and executions. Since we’ve been talking about omens, Josephus records that night following the executions, there was a full moon and Herod’s health started failing. Herod knowing the people hated him had grew concerned more of the most popular sages arrested and imprisoned in Jericho. He gave the order that as soon as he died, the sages were to be murdered, thus causing the people to mourn “as such as never had any king before him; the nation would mourn from their very soul.” After he died, His sister Salome hurried to the prison and lied that Herod had ordered the sages released. All Israel now had two reasons to rejoice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archelaus was what we might call a train-wreck. Keener: Archelaus exhibited his father’s worst flaws. The romans ultimately deposed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph opted instead for the territory of Antipas, who was slightly less dangerous than Archaleous. Antipas is the Herod who has john the Baptist executed and who will mock Jesus just before His crucifixion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jesus’s day, the population of Nazareth was probably only a few hundred people but archaeologists believe many people moved here from near Bethlehem, David’s town. Since Netzer means “branch” perhaps these were the original branch davidians. (if you’re not old enough to understand that joke, consider yourself blessed!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luke 2:41-45&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover. And when he was twelve years old, they went up according to custom. And when the feast was ended, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it, but supposing him to be in the group they went a day&amp;rsquo;s journey, but then they began to search for him among their relatives and acquaintances, and when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching for him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord commanded Israelite men to appear before him three times a year (Deut 16:16). Today, 2,000 years after the time of Jesus, Jewish families continue to “go up” to Jerusalem for the three annual feasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern notes that in that day, the tradition made allowances for folks far away, including granting an exception to the Torah requirement for those who would have had to travel long distances. Despite this, note that Joseph and Mary went to Passover every year.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was considered to have “come of age” when He reached twelve, but it is not known if a custom similar to today’s bar mitzvah was practiced in the 1st century AD. A bar mizvah as we know it today was first recorded not until the middle ages, but it appears to have roots in whatever was practiced in that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, many Jewish boys celebrate their bar mitzvahs at the Western Wall prayer plaza. In the photo above, the 13-year-old is wearing phylacteries and reading from the Torah Scroll. Overall it’s a joyous occasion, socially similar to a baptism in the church today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. And when his parents saw him, they were astonished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and I have been searching for you in great distress.” And he said to them, “Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father&#39;s house?”  And they did not understand the saying that he spoke to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Exo 20:12&lt;/sup&gt; “Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are probably not appreciating the non-verbal cues in verse 48-51. In no way is Jesus being snotty or disrespectful. The commandment to honor one’s father and mother was one of the most important – we will see this in verse 51 where Jesus is “submissive” to them. Stern notes that in light of what had already been revealed to them back when he was born, they should have known where to look. Another thought is Joseph and Mary likely would have been very proud of their oldest son involved in an adult-level discussion with elite sages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most visitors are surprised today at the expansive size of the Temple Mount. At about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;35 acres (14 ha), the Temple Mount would fit a total of 25 football fields. Joseph and Mary could have spent several hours looking before they found Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may find that answering a question with another question is irritating, but in that day asking intelligent questions was a way of demonstrating that you understand the material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; Timothy 2:15&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Study&lt;/strong&gt; to show yourself &lt;strong&gt;approved&lt;/strong&gt; to God, a &lt;strong&gt;worker&lt;/strong&gt; who has no need to be &lt;strong&gt;ashamed&lt;/strong&gt;, rightly handling the &lt;strong&gt;word&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;truth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus respectfully but unapologetically explained to His parents that the study of the Word took priority at that moment. Jesus would later use His knowledge of Scripture to fend off the devil’s attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we grow as talmidim, disciples, we want to be just like Jesus, which means, among our other necessary priorities such as work and tending to our families, we need to be consistently setting aside time for the serious study of His word. We have no idea when our time of temptation will come but the one thing we can do now is to be as prepared as possible by having a deep relationship with Jesus and His word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luke 2:51-52&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was submissive to them. And his mother treasured up all these things in her heart. And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not exactly true to say we know nothing of Jesus childhood outside of the Temple incident. Verse 52 tells us a lot, that Jesus increased with wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Dehut, concludes “Even without very many details of Jesus’ upbringing, you can clearly see the rural influence in how He taught. In the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7) He will spoke about Salt and Lamps, birds, lilies and grass, grapes, figs and trees. His parables had a rural focus, using seeds, weeds, leaven, fields, merchants and fishing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The time Jesus spent growing up in the rustic town of Nazareth with the humble family of Joseph and Mary provided the familial influence and upbringing that God wanted His son to have.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s going to lead in to our application for this lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;application&#34;&gt;Application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No one would have been attracted to Jesus because of his education or his zip code.If anyone was attracted to Jesus it was for what He taught, what He did, and who they believed Him to be. Are we attracted to Jesus for the right reasons?” – Jeremy DeHut&lt;/p&gt;

While there is a degree of being non-offensive, at least this way we can’t say Jesus was born Before Christ. I personally don’t have a problem with C.E and B.C.E. As for being non-offensive, Romans 12:18 says we should be at peace with all men; it’s not like we’re denying a critical doctrine of the faith by saying “CE” instead of “BC”&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Genesis 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;
God instructs Noah—the 10th from Adam and the only righteous man in a world consumed by violence and corruption—to build a large wooden ark, coated within and without with pitch. God decrees that a great deluge will wipe out all life from the face of the earth; but the ark will float upon the water, sheltering Noah and his family, and two members (male and female) of each animal species (and 7 of the &amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo; species).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;When man began to multiply on the face of the land and daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw that the daughters of man were attractive. And they took as their wives any they chose.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2 Peter 2:4 For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word for “hell” in 2 Peter 2:4 is “&lt;em&gt;Tartarus&lt;/em&gt;”, it is the only time the word is used in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homer notes Tartarus is as far below hades as the earth is below heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not someplace we want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Then the LORD said, “My Spirit shall not abide in man forever, for he is flesh: his days shall be 120 years.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Galatians 5:14-17 For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another. But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;td&gt;The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Num 13:33 And there we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim), and we seemed to ourselves like grasshoppers, and so we seemed to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jude 6 And the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 17:27 They were eating and drinking and marrying and being given in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plain reading of the first four verses indicates that angelic beings, “sons of God,” descended to earth and had relations with human women, creating a half-breed race called the Nephilim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, this is bizarre to conceptualize and awkward to discuss in polite company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, several alternate theories have arisen in order to have the text mean anything other than what it actually says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter, Jude, and likely all of the apostles, followed the plain text reading, which is also recorded in the book of 1 Enoch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nephilim means the fallen ones, as in fallen angels. Heiser covers this topic extensively in his book “The Unseen Realm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numbers 13:33 indicates the Nephilim were giants and Jewish tradition says they committed all types of violence and sexual abominations and even became cannibals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Greek the term is gigantes, which makes us think of “giants” but the root word is actually &lt;em&gt;gigas&lt;/em&gt;, which means “earth-born.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the Nephilim were on the earth “After that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14, 15 Rephaim&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numbers 13:33 Anakin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deut 3:11 Og, King of Bashan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Samuel 17 Goliath (and his four brothers) the Philistine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, Bashan is the Golan Heights at the foot of Mt. Hermon and Philistia was roughly where the Gaza Strip is today. These are two areas where Joshua failed to exterminate the inhabitants. (Joshua 15:14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might make more sense why God gave the otherwise disturbing order to Joshua to wipe out every man, woman and child in Cannan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;td&gt;The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And the LORD regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. So the LORD said, “I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rom 3:23-24 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rom 7:18-19 For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt 24:37-39 For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages teach that Cain spread his evil throughout the earth infecting his children and everyone else with his wickedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to guard the company we keep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we associate with righteous people, we will likely be righteous ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we associate with wicked people, we will likely become corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing has changed with the thoughts of our hearts. If we are given the opportunity to sin, the odds are high that we will. (Romans 3:23, 7:18-19).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That God was sorry He made man is quite a statement. Our sin grieves Him in ways we can’t imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Him to leave humanity unpunished would have been a miscarriage of justice, like when a jury acquits a murderer based on something other than the facts of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD. These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation. Noah walked with God. And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 Peter 2:5 if he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a herald of righteousness, with seven others, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lam 1:16 “For these things I weep; my eyes flow with tears; for a comforter is far from me, one to revive my spirit; my children are desolate, for the enemy has prevailed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Jn 2:1 My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an &lt;strong&gt;advocate&lt;/strong&gt; with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah was the lone exception to the wickedness around him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were indeed difficult times to remain blameless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah means comfort, comforter, or rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His parents said, “This one will give us rest from our work and from the toil of our hands.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, they expected Noah to be the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Lamentations 1:16, the “Comforter” becomes a title of the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1 John 2:1, the Greek word translated as “advocate” is &lt;em&gt;paraclete&lt;/em&gt;, which can also mean “comforter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Righteous and blameless do not mean sinless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul (Romans 3:23) and John (1 John 1:8) teach that no one is sinless other than Jesus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word for blameless denotes an animal that is acceptable for a sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They mean he had a heart to seek God and he lived his life in accordance with God’s standards of morality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah was a man of integrity; he was doing his job as an Image-bearer of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can read 2 Peter 2:5 as “a preacher of righteousness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By modern standards, Noah was the least successful preacher ever. Not a single person repented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether anyone is listening or not, godly people should stick out from the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you and I sticking out in a good way, or are we blending in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the “walking with God” phrase again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our discipleship journey is this kind of walk, path, road, or way. Hence our name Talmidim Way: the goal is for us to Walk with God along the way of disciples following after Yeshua, our great teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster writes, “Walking with God means keeping His commandments, but it also means enjoying His company.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three verses in the Torah that give us more clarity on walking with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteronomy 8:6 - So you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God by walking in his ways and by fearing him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteronomy 10:12 - “And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteronomy 11:22 - For if you will be careful to do all this commandment that I command you to do, loving the LORD your God, walking in all his ways, and holding fast to him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As talmidim, let’s glue ourselves to Yeshua and enjoy the walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col style=&#34;width: 50%&#34; /&gt;

&lt;th&gt;Genesis 6:11-13&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Now the earth was corrupt in God&#39;s sight, and the earth was filled with violence. And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth. And God said to Noah, “I have determined to make an end of all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them with the earth.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luke 17:26 Just as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rom 6:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eze 33:11 Say to them, As I live, declares the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live; turn back, turn back from your evil ways, for why will you die, O house of Israel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word for violence here is “Hamas;” yes, as in the terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its mildest form, it can mean “unjust gain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rabbis build on this to say that stealing of any amount is equivalent to physical violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one were to steal only a few dollars, who is to say that the victim might not have invested that sum enough to leave an inheritance for his children’s children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus Pliskin says, “We are forbidden to steal even small amounts.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If it’s not yours, don’t take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes not only physical items but with our tongues, we can also steal another’s reputation or another’s joy. Some kill by launching rockets at civilians; others kill with the tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us not do these works of Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God took no pleasure in what He was about to do. (Eze 33:11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the flood is a story of mercy. He didn’t wipe out the universe and start over; He took that which was broken and fixed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gets us to the Jewish concept of Tikkun Olam. That is Hebrew for fixing the (broken) world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the modern sense, the term is often appropriated by left-leaning organizations; but in a Biblical sense, that is exactly what God is doing here and it’s exactly what Jesus did throughout His earthly ministry, including His death on the Cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tikkun Olam means restoring the world back to God’s original intent, culminating with the New Eden/New Jerusalem in Revelation 21-22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Make yourself an ark of gopher wood. Make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch. This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark 300 cubits, its breadth 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits. Make a roof for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above, and set the door of the ark in its side. Make it with lower, second, and third decks.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 Peter 3:18-20 For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, because they formerly did not obey, when God&#39;s patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Pe 2:9 then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rabbis ask, “why did God trouble Noah to build an ark? He could have saved Noah in many other ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rashi answers that “the project was designed to arouse curiosity. For 120 years, people would be prompted to ask him, ‘Why is this necessary?’ Noah would then reply, ‘The Holy One, blessed be he, is about to bring a flood upon the world.’ Perhaps then they would repent.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“God held off judgment for 120 years in order to give people and opportunity to repent.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pliskin continues, “From here, we learn a practical lesson about admonition. For an admonition to be successful, we must find ways to arouse the listener’s interest.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter makes a wild statement here in 1 Pet 3:18-20 – he says it casually as if his original readers knew exactly what he was referencing. Apparently, Jesus after His death but before His resurrection visited the fallen angels of Genesis 6:1-3 and proclaimed His triumph over them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah will model the salvation of the world that God eventually brings through Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster: “Those within Messiah’s salvation (symbolized by the ark), though few in number, will pass through the cleansing waters of judgment and enter the kingdom, just as Noah and his family survived the flood and repopulated the earth.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big difference is that Noah saved only himself and his family, while Messiah brings salvation to the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish Talmud speculates on this topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If the Holy One, blessed be He, did miracles for Noah who was righteous but not completely righteous…how much more so if he had been a perfectly righteous man!”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word translated as “roof” in the ESV is a difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could mean a window, in the sense of a skylight, but one sage believed it referred to a precious stone that would illuminate and provide light for the entire vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this respect, the light can be compared to the menorah in the temple, the only source of light that symbolizes the light of Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimensions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cubit is nominally 18” but could be as much as 25”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Missler, a 25” cubit would result in 4.1 MILLION cubic feet, the equivalent of 1400 railroad cars, enough to hold 340,000 sheep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a 25” cubit, the Ark could have been 625 feet long, 104 feet wide and 63 feet high, giving it a displacement of 65000 tons (the Titanic displaced 46,00 tons).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ark replica in Kentucky is a bit more conservative, using a 20.4” cubit for 510 feet long, 85 feet wide and 51 feet high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad joke: Q: what does a ship weigh? A: It’s anchor. (Volume is measured in displacement, not weight).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;For behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life under heaven. Everything that is on the earth shall die. But I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons&#39; wives with you.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mat 24:39-41 and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. [40] Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heb 11:7 By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household. By this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just as the people did in Noah’s day, the generation of the Master’s return will ignore the warnings.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A popular end-times fiction series from the late 90s was called “Left Behind.” It imagined the world under the reign of the antichrist after all of the good Christians have been taken up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More often in the bible, it is the opposite. It is not the good who are taken. The evil are taken in judgment while the good are left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Flood, righteous Noah and his family are the ones “left behind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Genesis 6:19-22&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female. Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground, according to its kind, two of every sort shall come in to you to keep them alive. Also take with you every sort of food that is eaten, and store it up. It shall serve as food for you and for them.” Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 11:1,6 There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit… The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat, and the calf and the lion and the fattened calf together; and a little child shall lead them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most know the story of Noah’s Ark even if they are not Christian or Jewish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all of the ancient civilizations tell of a time long ago when the gods got so angry, they flood the earth to wipe out humanity except for a man and a woman who are left to repopulate the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our children’s stories, we often picture a boat overflowing with animals and the giraffe is always sticking his head out of the roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Flood is not a harmless children’s story – life was brought to the point of near extinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will see a footnote later that there are seven of every clean animal, which begs the question, “how did Noah know which animals were clean?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That all of the animals were made to live peaceably, including we presume natural predators of other animals, speaks of the shalom of the messianic age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A traditional Jewish Rabbi said of that era: “There will be neither famine nor war, neither envy nor competition, for good things will flow in abundance.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wicked versus the righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro 15:8-10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sacrifice of the wicked (Cain) is an abomination to the LORD,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but the prayer of the upright (Noah) is acceptable to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way of the wicked (Cain) is an abomination to the LORD,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but he loves him (Noah) who pursues righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is severe discipline for him (Cain) who forsakes the way;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;whoever hates reproof will die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(1) &amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Ephesus, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven gold menorahs: (2) &amp;ldquo;I know what you have been doing, how hard you have worked, how you have persevered, and how you can&amp;rsquo;t stand wicked people; so you tested those who call themselves emissaries but aren&amp;rsquo;t—and you found them to be liars. (3) You are persevering, and you have suffered for my sake without growing weary. (4) But I have this against you: you have lost the love you had at first. (5) Therefore, remember where you were before you fell, turn from this sin, and do what you used to do before. Otherwise, I will come to you and remove your menorah from its place—if you don&amp;rsquo;t turn from your sin! (6) But you have this in your favor: you hate what the Nicolaitans do—I hate it too. (7) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities. To him winning the victory I will give the right to eat from the Tree of Life which is in God&amp;rsquo;s Gan-`Eden.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;ephesus-geography&#34;&gt;Ephesus geography&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/9a3d8b211ca54e93254810b0d19fd2e0.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ephesus was known as the &amp;ldquo;Queen of Asia&amp;rdquo; for its wealth and beauty. Its location meant it could serve as an essential waypoint from Rome to the eastern provinces, either by sea or land. A network of Roman roads connected the seven messianic assemblies. They also eventually linked up with routes leading to Asia proper, including Israel, the Fertile Crescent, and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/e2148e2e2d165d8bdab7dd37acbd2df6.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
During the Roman Empire, Ephesus was a significant harbor village. On the map inset, you can see estimations of the shoreline from 500 BCE to 60 CE to the present. The change was caused by dramatic silting from the Cayster River, making the modern harbor useless. The photo below the map shows the swampy area of the Roman port today.
&lt;img src=&#34;images/b212f4d346b26eab22e6d7c8d72b8189.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photograph shows the Great Theater (with seating up to 25,000) with the street that led to the now silted harbor. Acts 19:21-41 describes a riot that occurred when devotees of Diana/Artemis said that Paul posed a clear and present danger to their way of life. The theater is where the riot took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The harbor street (shown in the center of the picture) would have been lined with shops on both sides.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There was also a large &amp;ldquo;agora,&amp;rdquo; or marketplace adjacent. &amp;ldquo;This would have been the likeliest place…for Aquila, Priscilla, and Paul to have set up shop for their long stay in Ephesus.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; DeSilva also notes the market &amp;ldquo;was a major note in the flow of goods from the East to Rome. Many of the cargoes listed in Rev 18:12-13 could be found arriving in Ephesus from the East for further transportation west.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We need to imagine how difficult it would have been to live life as a set-apart believer in a thoroughly pagan environment like Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ephesus-secular-history&#34;&gt;Ephesus secular history&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars believe Hittites founded Ephesus in 1400 BCE. Archeologists have excavated remains of an early temple to a mother goddess, a Hittite fertility deity that later morphed into Diana/Artemis. If the name &amp;ldquo;Hittite&amp;rdquo; rings a bell, Uriah, one of David&amp;rsquo;s mighty men, was a Hittite. Uriah had a beautiful wife named Bathsheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ephesus repeatedly picked the wrong side in the Peloponnesian, Persian, and Roman wars. Still, it became a favored city under Rome and competed with Pergamum (and Smyrna to a lesser extent) over which city was most favored by Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;ephesus-and-artemis&#34;&gt;Ephesus and Artemis&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/29cb53aa62f9eec4e1ef5e2b61e9994d.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temple to Artemis/Diana was one of the famous &amp;ldquo;Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.&amp;rdquo; With a footprint of 220&amp;rsquo; x 425&amp;rsquo;, It is four times larger than the Parthenon in Athens&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It was first built in the mid-6th century BCE atop previous temples dating to the 8th century (the time of King Hezekiah in Judah). Artemis, called Diana by the Romans, was the virgin goddess of the moon, fertility, and nature. Our &amp;ldquo;mother nature&amp;rdquo; myth likely comes from her. Artemis is the earth goddess, nurturing and fertile. As we can see in the photo,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Artemis is depicted as multi-breasted (or multiple eggs, also a symbol of fertility). She can also be cruel, vindictive, and destructive.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the map above, we can see that the temple was situated about a mile outside the central Roman city. Bolen writes, &amp;quot; This makes sense, given Artemis’s identity as a goddess of the wilds.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Fertility rites involving temple prostitutes were shared, which Paul disrupted in the New Testament period. It appears to have been destroyed around 400 CE. Today not much remains of the site except for a conspicuous pillar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/a7ce2c2fc59b27e13b282f7ef52ee27a.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
This coin[^9] from AD 50 shows how much the city identified with Diana, down to its very economy. This is why the townspeople saw Paul not only as a religious threat but also as an economic one. The reverse shows the cult statue of Diana (Artemis) of Ephesus and identifies it as “Diana of Ephesus” (DIANA EPHESIA). It is believed that this coin was struck at the Ephesus mint around AD 50–51. In addition to the temple to Artemis, there were numerous other temples, including a large structure devoted to the worship of Domitian. We&#39;ve mentioned the persecutions against Christians and Jews, but Domitian was also paranoid that fellow Romans conspired against him. He arrested and terrorized anyone he suspected. As a post-script, Domitian was so hated that upon his death, the citizens of Ephesus tore down the statue of him and scratched his name from inscriptions. 
&lt;p&gt;The population of Ephesus during the New Testament period was believed to have been around 200,000, making Ephesus the fifth largest city in the Roman empire. There was an extensive library there, and the city was known as a center for studying arts and magic. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Of note, there was also an infamous and large brothel in Ephesus.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; All of this possibly gives rise to Paul&amp;rsquo;s comment in Ephesians 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Eph 2:1-3 And you were dead in the trespasses and sins (2) in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience— (3) among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the New Testament period, Ephesus and Miletus rivaled each other for prominence. Still, Miletus was having the same problem of its harbor silting up and turning the area into a malaria-ridden swamp just like Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missler records that the Romans deforested the region, which caused the soil to erode into the rivers, which ended up in the harbor.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today, the coastline is several miles to the west.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The former harbor is an unappealing swamp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ephesus was restored by the Seljuk Turks during the Islamic period but never regained its glory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ephesus-new-testament-history&#34;&gt;Ephesus New Testament History&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church tradition places the Apostle John at Ephesus starting around AD 40. He is believed to have died around 100 and is buried at St. John&amp;rsquo;s Basilica, near the ancient Temple of Artemis. We believe John wrote his epistles and possibly his Gospel from Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common theme of his epistles emphasizes love and warnings about false teachers. The Gospel of John also contains several discourses on love and light. John develops a secondary theme: the Jerusalem establishment is bad shepherds, which is another way of saying false teachers leading the faithful astray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ephesus is likely more familiar to Christians as being connected with Paul and the books of Acts and Ephesians. Acts 18 tells us that Apollos, referenced several times in the New Testament, came to Ephesus knowing only of John the Baptist. Aquila and Priscilla &amp;ldquo;expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.&amp;rdquo; Apollos and Paul narrowly missed each other in Ephesus, having departed for Corinth before Paul arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/d11a5f4ff4359cc074dd9a9438e998d0.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city was also a focus of Paul&amp;rsquo;s third missionary Journey (Acts 19-20, see selected verses below). We can gather that Paul viewed Ephesus as a type of &amp;ldquo;ground zero&amp;rdquo; in the Jewish diaspora. As noted above, Acts 19 records a riot between Paul and those whose livelihood he threatened by turning people towards the one true God. Paul was not afraid to &amp;ldquo;mix it up&amp;rdquo; for the Gospel. This photo shows the Arcadian Way looking back up toward the theater. The acoustics are excellent. Despite the distance of the middle and upper seating sections, a person on the stage speaking in a moderate voice can easily be heard from there. The din of a shouting crowd would have been tremendous. As a testament to Roman engineering, a few excavated and restored theaters are still used today. The Roman theatre at Caesarea in Israel frequently has rock concerts and shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prophetically, Paul told the Ephesian elders to guard against the divisions and false teachings. In Revelation 2, Jesus would later commend the Ephesians for their diligence in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Act 20:27-31 For I did not shrink from proclaiming to you the whole plan of God. (28) &amp;ldquo;Watch out for yourselves, and for all the flock in which the Ruach HaKodesh has placed you as leaders, to shepherd God&amp;rsquo;s Messianic community, which he won for himself at the cost of his own Son&amp;rsquo;s blood. (29) I know that after I leave, savage wolves will come in among you, and they won&amp;rsquo;t spare the flock. (30) &lt;strong&gt;Even from among your own number, men will arise and teach perversions of the truth&lt;/strong&gt;, in order to drag away the talmidim after themselves. (31) So stay alert! Remember that for three years, night and day, with tears in my eyes, I never stopped warning you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeSilva notes the entire book of Revelation, not just the letter to Ephesus, &amp;ldquo;spoke a poignant word to Christians in a city so supportive of the Roman imperial cult and the Roman economy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We can also understand why Paul faced such a fierce battle here. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t just presenting an alternate worldview as might be when someone converts today. &amp;ldquo;His proclamation of the one and only one God threatened the city&amp;rsquo;s very identity and its claim to fame, not to mention the livelihood of the concessioners like Demetrius whose trade depended on the worship of Artemis.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in Revelation, when John writes of a beast with a religious system that encompassed economic and devotional aspects, his first-century readers would have understood he was communicating Rome and its imperial cult system were thoroughly demonic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ephesus is mentioned 17 times in the New Testament, including twice in Revelation. By contrast, Thyatira is only mentioned one other time in Acts, and Laodicea is mentioned only four other times, all in Colossians. The other four cities are not mentioned elsewhere in the New Testament. Ephesus was the heavy hitter in this group of seven cities. Paul&amp;rsquo;s team likely brought the gospel to these six cities (and beyond) from Ephesus. It is somewhat curious that John and Paul&amp;rsquo;s paths appear not to have crossed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Act 18:21 But on taking leave of them, he said, “I will return to you if God wills,” and he set sail from Ephesus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act 18:24 Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, competent in the Scriptures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act 19:1 And it happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the inland country and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act 19:17 And this became known to all the residents of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. And fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was extolled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act 19:26 And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost all of Asia this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great many people, saying that gods made with hands are not gods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act 19:28 Hearing this, they were filled with rage and began bellowing, &amp;ldquo;Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act 19:34 But as soon as they recognized that he was a Jew, they began bellowing in unison, &amp;ldquo;Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!&amp;rdquo; and they kept it up for about two hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act 19:35 And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, “Men of Ephesus, who is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Artemis, and of the sacred stone that fell from the sky?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act 20:16 For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not have to spend time in Asia, for he was hastening to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(1) &amp;ldquo;To the angel of the (&lt;em&gt;ecclesia)&lt;/em&gt; Messianic Community in Ephesus, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven gold menorahs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mat 18:20 For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.”  Joh 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ecclesia&#34;&gt;Ecclesia&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cities such as Ephesus would likely have had several synagogues. The word &lt;em&gt;ecclesia&lt;/em&gt; reminds us that this is not to a denominational organization or a church building, but a body of believers set apart and called out to be a light in their city. Jesus expects His ecclesia to show evidence they are His, and where they are, there He is among them (Mat 18:20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, he holds them and is present with them. We explored the menorah symbolism previously so we won&amp;rsquo;t repeat it here. We can also draw a comparison to John 1:1 - Jesus is WITH God, meaning alongside and distinct from God the Father, and at the same time, WITH God, meaning He and the Father are indistinguishable. In many ways beyond our explanation, the same relationship is true with Jesus and His ecclesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will find that the English translation of the city name has some significance on the tone and content of each letter. Ephesus means &amp;ldquo;Desired one&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;darling.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This has meaning as later Jesus will say they lost the &amp;ldquo;love they had at first.&amp;rdquo; Commentators often assume Jesus is the darling and once desired One they stopped loving; however, there is another possibility we will explore. Ephesus was also a favored city in the Roman Empire; perhaps this pride had seeped its way into the fellowship. As we noted in the overview, Ephesus was also a place of great learning with an extensive library. However, eternal truth is not found in secular education but in Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;

(3) You are persevering, and you have suffered for my sake without growing weary.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eph&lt;/strong&gt; 4:14 We will then no longer be infants tossed about by the waves and blown along by every wind of teaching, at the mercy of people clever in devising ways to deceive.   Mat 7:23 Then I will tell them to their faces, &amp;lsquo;I never knew you! Get away from me, you workers of lawlessness!&amp;rsquo;   1 John 4:1 Beloved, do not believe every spirit but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 Cor 11:13-15 For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. 14 And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. 15 So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I know your works and your labor&amp;rdquo; is much more to the point. Jesus is passing a judgment on the &lt;strong&gt;results&lt;/strong&gt; of their body of work, what we might collectively call their &amp;ldquo;deeds.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I know what you have been doing&amp;rdquo; sounds like He&amp;rsquo;s only interested in how they have been passing the time. With that said, many Christians might start shaking if Jesus told us, &amp;ldquo;I know what you&amp;rsquo;ve been doing.&amp;rdquo; While that is true in the sense that He sees everything, I think the purpose here is the collective output of the work from the. body of believers. Chuck Missler tells the story of a child panicking when she realizes that Jesus sees her every move. Her grandfather reassured her by saying, &amp;ldquo;Jesus loves you so much, He can&amp;rsquo;t take His eyes off you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice Jesus didn&amp;rsquo;t say &amp;ldquo;I know what you believe&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I know what you profess to be true.&amp;rdquo; While we need to understand God properly, believers won&amp;rsquo;t be judged on how accurate our theology is. We will be judged based on our deeds and whether those deeds were effective for the Kingdom. For believers, this is not a judgment of our salvation but our rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are you and I doing at tolerating wickedness? Do we tolerate it? Wink at it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As discussed in the introduction, the Ephesians headed John&amp;rsquo;s and Paul&amp;rsquo;s warnings to weed out false teachers. Remember that the &amp;ldquo;wicked people,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;liars,&amp;rdquo; the people Paul labels as &amp;ldquo;Savage wolves&amp;rdquo; (Act 20:29), and the people John labels &amp;ldquo;deceivers and antichrists&amp;rdquo; (2 John 1:7) considered themselves to be Christians. It would be unnecessary to test pagans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are folks who called themselves Christians but are not. Later we will meet a group of people who call themselves Jews but are not. The plain sense is obvious. These are imposters, masquerading as members of the faith. Scholars believe this may have been a group called the &amp;ldquo;protognostics&amp;rdquo; or the early gnostics. Gnostics were a heretical offshoot that surprisingly influenced a good portion of early church theology. Note that they were not trying to attack the church but were infiltrating it. More damage to a church is done from within than without. Persecution often causes the true church to grow. It&amp;rsquo;s easier to stand up when you can see the enemy. The problem with church divisions is that the enemy masquerades as a fellow believer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ephesians 4:14, Paul compares a group we might call &amp;ldquo;believers with an agenda&amp;rdquo; to a storm at sea. We aren&amp;rsquo;t told whether they knew they were deceiving or whether their beliefs were genuine but in error. I don&amp;rsquo;t think we can assume all one group or the other. It is probably a mix. The group, along with true charlatans, were self-deceived people, and as a result, they were inadvertently deceiving others. In either case, they came with an agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest person in the whole world to fool is yourself. We said a believer shouldn&amp;rsquo;t fear when reading Revelation, but there is one critically important exception. We need to have a healthy fear of God. Jesus called these believers &amp;ldquo;evil liars.&amp;rdquo; It is to this group; He will speak those terrible words, &amp;ldquo;I never knew you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of which group Jesus had in mind in the first century, a fair question we all should ask from time to time is, &amp;ldquo;I call myself a believer; how do I know Jesus wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call me an evil liar?&amp;rdquo; Am I absolutely sure Jesus won&amp;rsquo;t tell me, &amp;ldquo;depart from me; I never knew you&amp;rdquo;? I see no harm in making sure we are safely NOT in this group. The best companies with nothing to hide still conduct internal and external auditing and monitoring as a way of making certain minor mistakes don’t turn into catastrophic problems. They confidently open their books for inspection. They do not do this from a position of fear. They aren&amp;rsquo;t worried that the auditors might find something. Mature companies EXPECT auditors to find things the company can then correct and become stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no reason, as believers, we should not have the same mindset. This is what Jesus is communicating in the sermon on the mount (Mat 5-7). Allow the Holy Spirit to audit our books. Show us where we are making mistakes so we can be stronger talmidim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ephesians were great external auditors; they could spot fatal flaws in others. However, we&amp;rsquo;re about to find out they were terrible internal auditors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Jer 2:2 “Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, Thus says the LORD, “I remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride, how you followed me in the wilderness, in a land not sown.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is often described as the loss of love for Jesus, but we must note they were commended for being tested and suffering for His sake without growing weary. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine anyone suffering for Jesus who didn&amp;rsquo;t love him. We don&amp;rsquo;t usually suffer for someone we don&amp;rsquo;t love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternate theory might be as they were testing others, they were all truth and no love. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that they didn&amp;rsquo;t directly love Jesus, but more didn&amp;rsquo;t manifest that love in their treatment of others. They became insular. If we&amp;rsquo;ve been around long enough, we will eventually visit a church like this and probably have met Christians like this. They may teach the word and have the most solid doctrine, but you can feel something is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not just any deficiency. This is a sin that can lead to our light being extinguished. Think about those people who are all rules and have no love. Do you find yourself wanting to be around them? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus says the two greatest commandments are Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 19:18. Both have to do with love. I believe a plausible argument for what was happening at Ephesus was that, in the onslaught of false teachers, they became cynical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sympathetic. They were in an environment where they had to be immediately suspicious of everyone they met. If they weren&amp;rsquo;t believers, were they there to inform against them? If they claimed to be a believer, were they running a con so they could entrap or infiltrate? If their motives were seemingly pure, were they nonetheless one of the false teachers Paul had warned them to weed out? I&amp;rsquo;m not surprised if they tended to become insular and protective. When we are like this, we are not outward-focused. When we are not outward-focused, we are not letting our lights shine. We are not loving our neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is calling them to repent of this and repent now. The mark of a true believer is the ability to repent when he is wrong. The Greek word metanoia, translated as repent, implies changing one&amp;rsquo;s thinking in response in truth. The Hebrew word for repentance, תְשׁוּבָה - teshuva, is more action-oriented. The root means &amp;ldquo;return&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;turn around now!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you do not&amp;rdquo; means we have free will. Although it is difficult to imagine a regenerate believer not responding to Jesus, ultimately we have the freedom to not repent. This verse can be read from several different eternal security perspectives depending on one&amp;rsquo;s pre-established position on the matter. Dr. Fructenbaum points out that, like our fellowships today, 1st-century congregations likely had a mix of true believers and unsaved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;silting&#34;&gt;Silting&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke above how Ephesus lost its prominence, not by majestic conquest, but by gradual silting. The silting occurred gradually; it&amp;rsquo;s doubtful the citizens even noticed. Yet today, what was once a grand harbor is now a marshy swamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Ephesian Christians lost their first love by allowing the silt of spiritual indifference to accumulate over the years. It can happen, can&amp;rsquo;t it? Love for Jesus is the hub from which every other activity (including deeds and doctrine) should flow.&amp;rdquo; – Wayne Stiles&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Psa 26:5 I hate the assembly of evildoers, and I will not sit with the wicked&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two critical questions we must ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who were the Nicolaitans?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we know we are NOT Nicolaitans?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 2:6 (Ephesus) and Revelation 2:14-15 (Pergamum) refer to the deeds and teaching of this group called the Nicolaitans. There&amp;rsquo;s an obvious question: &amp;ldquo;Who were the Nicolaitans?&amp;rdquo; We have no historical record of them before the Revelation. There is also a less obvious question: &amp;ldquo;How do I know I am not a Nicolaitan?&amp;rdquo; Without knowing their deeds and teachings, we could unknowingly be doing and teaching the same things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that anyone could make up anything they wanted to define who the Nicolaitans were after the fact. Here&amp;rsquo;s a hypothetical illustration. Suppose no one had ever heard the term &amp;ldquo;bear left&amp;rdquo; when suddenly it appeared in a set of directions. We could imagine a son asking his father, &amp;ldquo;Dad, what does &amp;lsquo;bear left&amp;rsquo; mean?&amp;rdquo; The answer could be, &amp;ldquo;well son, one time a bear was chasing a man, and he veered slightly to the left. The bear didn&amp;rsquo;t follow, and the man made it to safety. That&amp;rsquo;s what the term bear left means.&amp;rdquo; Of course, that answer is absurd. Just because words sound the same doesn&amp;rsquo;t automatically mean they&amp;rsquo;re linguistically connected (and the root word for bearing or heading has zero connection to the carnivorous mammal). But that&amp;rsquo;s basically what we are left with when trying to figure out who the Nicolaitans were. Scholars assume the definition is contained within the word &amp;ldquo;Nicolaitans&amp;rdquo;; they just aren&amp;rsquo;t sure what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, we know we must limit our conjectures to things that would have made sense to the original audience. While we don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly, we can make an educated guess about the nature of their deeds. The letter to Ephesus gives us no additional information but based on Revelation 2:14, Jesus speaks of the Nicolaitans in the context of sexual and dietary misconduct. For this, we need to dive into Acts 15 for some background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-acts-15-decision&#34;&gt;The Acts 15 Decision&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more Gentiles wanted to join the Jewish sect of the Nazarenes, a division arose among the Jewish leadership. Were these Gentiles going to be required to do a complete conversion to Judaism? In many respects, requiring conversion made sense. Ours is a Jewish sect with a Jewish Rabbi Jewish apostles, worshiping in Jewish synagogues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter, among others, made an impassioned plea that Judaism is a discipline as much as it is a religion or ethnicity. The sages speak of taking on the &amp;ldquo;yoke of the Torah.&amp;rdquo; We see this reference in Acts 15:10. The picture shows a plow where a pair of oxen would be yoked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we grow, we can take on more of that yoke. However, just as one would not attach a heavy load to a baby ox, Peter said we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t put the total weight of the Torah on a new adult gentile believer. The early church fathers agreed that Gentile converts to Judaism would be welcomed, but immediate conversion (signified by circumcision for males) was not required. In other words, Gentile believers were not required to take on the entire &amp;ldquo;yoke.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this said, new believers were to set themselves apart from pagans in four critical areas. These are recorded in Acts 15:28-29:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements: (29) that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these deals with feeding our flesh. The first three pertain to guardrails around the food they ate, and the last one has to do with keeping sexually pure. As we progress through the seven letters, we will see that these two categories are recurring concerns of Jesus (as we see in Rev 2:14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is evidence that these four stipulations were only intended as a starting point. A late 1st-century document called the &lt;em&gt;Didache&lt;/em&gt; appears to be a manual written by the Apostles with further instructions for growing Gentile talmidim, who were be expected to grow in maturity and gradually adopt additional Torah requirements. They did this not as a legalistic &amp;ldquo;got to&amp;rdquo; but as a grateful &amp;ldquo;get to.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind the list of restrictions mentioned in Acts is not a complete set of prohibitions. Were they allowed to steal and murder? Of course not. These four sins were specific challenges to new gentile followers of the Jewish messiah living in a Roman world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also need to discuss some background on &amp;ldquo;food&amp;rdquo; versus &amp;ldquo;not food&amp;rdquo; in the Jewish mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today most gentiles have categories: &amp;ldquo;food&amp;rdquo; is anything we desire to eat, and &amp;ldquo;not food&amp;rdquo; is everything else. Note the individual determines what food is and what is not, not God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Leviticus 11, Observant Jews have three categories, and it is God who determines which is in which type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Unclean Animals = Not food: this includes pork, anything that is a scavenger, and sea creatures without fins and scales. Items in category 1 are not &amp;ldquo;unclean food.&amp;rdquo; They are not food at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Food: vegetation, beef, and other land mammals meeting the requirements, fish, and fowl (unless otherwise excluded)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Unclean Food: the items in category #2, killed or prepared improperly, such as being strangled or found already dead (Lev 22:8), still containing lifeblood (Lev 7:26), or sacrificed to idols (Num 25:2-3). Also, fruit from a tree planted within three years is unclean and not to be eaten (Lev 11:34)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while they did not put the whole yoke of the Torah on new Gentile believers, it does appear they imposed the total weight as it pertains to dietary restrictions and sexual boundaries. Scholars debate this, but it becomes challenging to read Acts 15 any other way (don&amp;rsquo;t take my word for it; do your own research). You must think Jewish. Would it have made sense for a group of observant Jews to say it is OK to eat pork that was not dedicated to an idol, but it is not OK for them to eat the lamb that was so dedicated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to cloud the matter further, but the biblical dietary laws are not exactly the same as &amp;ldquo;keeping Kosher&amp;rdquo; as it&amp;rsquo;s practiced today. Modern rabbis have imposed many additional restrictions not directly in the Bible, such as it is forbidden to have dairy and meat in the same meal. There are no cheeseburgers at Kosher McDonalds in Israel. And there definitely are no bacon cheeseburgers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One additional nuance: Judaism was a recognized religion in the Roman empire, which means they were allowed to keep their dietary regulations. While most food sold in the market had been offered to one or more Roman gods, Jewish food was not. Lizorkin says, &amp;ldquo;Jews had their own slaughtering rules and privileges…food delivery and consumption did not follow the normal route of offerings to the Roman gods.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As mentioned in different contexts, Gentiles did not have this option. Almost everything they bought would have been offered to an idol. In other words, this requirement would have likely caused significant hardship on believing gentiles, but the Church required it because they were called to be separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul addresses many of these same challenges in his letters, particularly 1 Corinthians. Paul, who acknowledged that false gods were nothing, still sided with the Jerusalem council and forbade followers from eating food in any way associated with the Roman imperial cult (1 cor 8). If our view of Paul is that he came to set all rules aside, we may need to double-check our interpretation against Paul&amp;rsquo;s actual words recorded in Scripture. Again we see the importance of Acts 17:11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 15 also includes abstaining from sexual impropriety. Ephesus had a notorious brothel in addition to the male and female prostitutes at the temple of Diana. This picture is from a sidewalk in Ephesus. The heart shape on the upper left is filled with dots, interpreted as money being dropped into either a metaphorical heart or a literal purse. The left footprint is considered a directional indicator so that even the illiterate would know in which direction to go. A building interpreted as a brothel was found on the left side of this same block, in the foot&amp;rsquo;s direction. To the right of the footprint, there is also a drawing of a woman with a crown, usually taken as a representation of a prostitute. The followers of Jesus were to shun all immorality, which was prevalent in their day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food and sexual misconduct are two recurrent themes in the seven letters. These were also two items of Balaam&amp;rsquo;s treachery referenced in 2:14. As Lizorkin states, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to notice that out of four behaviors forbidden to Gentiles, two had to do with the Nicolaitans and the Balaam/Balak issues.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, let&amp;rsquo;s explore the three main conjectures present in most commentaries. According to each theory, their view is related to the supposed etymology of the word &amp;ldquo;Nicolaitans&amp;rdquo; and thus would have been understood by the original audience. Remember our &amp;ldquo;bear left&amp;rdquo; story above as we explore each of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;conjecture-1-an-early-type-of-clergy-that-ruled-the-people-laity-with-a-heavy-hand&#34;&gt;Conjecture #1: An early type of clergy that ruled the people (laity) with a heavy hand&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rationale: the word &amp;ldquo;Nicolaitans&amp;rdquo; comes from νικαω (to rule, conquer) and λαος (people, laity)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, even though the Apostles commissioned bishops, pastors, elders, and deacons, some in these offices let power go to their heads. On the surface, this seems plausible because we know how power can corrupt. Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;The servant is not greater than his lord.&amp;rdquo; John 13:16. Our Lord washed feet. Even his two great disciples, James and John, appeared to jockey for status by asking to sit at Jesus&amp;rsquo; right and left hands. So on the surface, this one sounds excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the more I study the context, the more I have trouble with this one. If this is supposedly leadership ruling over the laity, how is the Ephesian leadership in a position to resist this? In other words, a group wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to advance this position unless they were already in authority, which in Ephesus, the Nicolaitans clearly were not. How could the Pergamum assembly embrace it if they were subjected to inappropriate authority?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no historical basis for this position other than taking the words Nikao and Laos and putting them together. In some ways, it sounds like a contrived dig against the Catholic Church, which of course, would make it anachronistic. There is no way the audience could have foreseen a heavy-handed clergy restricting the rights of the laity when such behavior was probably at least 200 years in the future. While it&amp;rsquo;s true we&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed the bad fruit of such abuses of authority in recent years (and indeed abuses dating back to the middle ages), that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean these abuses were present in the 1st century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to the point, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit the context of the letter to Pergamum, which clearly deals with sexual and dietary misconduct. With that said, many people I greatly respect who are much smarter than I am, promote this view. So, we&amp;rsquo;ll hold in in our realm of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;conjecture-2-a-gnostic-cult-founded-by-nicholas-one-of-the-original-acts-65-deacons&#34;&gt;Conjecture #2: A Gnostic cult founded by Nicholas, one of the original Acts 6:5 deacons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rationale: the word &amp;ldquo;Nicolaitans&amp;rdquo; comes from νικολαον, &amp;ldquo;Nicholas&amp;rdquo; in reference to the deacon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view has historical evidence to support it (documented by Iraneus and others), but again it is documented after the fact so that it could be a &amp;ldquo;bear left&amp;rdquo; type of fable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Nicholas-followers believed all acts of the flesh (specifically sexual and likely dietary) were eternally meaningless. A core tenet of Gnosticism is that only the soul matters, so why not indulge in pleasures of the flesh? They held that Jesus was a spirit being who only appeared to be physical. For example, when he walked, he didn&amp;rsquo;t leave footprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view led to the gnostics ignoring Acts 15. If only the soul matters; they didn&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about physical restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that Gnostics were a heretical group and were a problem for the early church. Much of John&amp;rsquo;s epistles refute Gnosticism, and they are a strong candidate for the people for whom Jesus describes as &amp;ldquo;saying they are apostles but are not.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas Paul admonished us to keep the sinful flesh in check, Gnostics held that &amp;ldquo;anything goes&amp;rdquo; (yes, anything) because the flesh doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. As a result, they lived with unrestrained indulgence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One version has Nicholas himself (interestingly the only Gentile among the seven deacons) teaching strange ways. Another variant of the story is that Nicholas reportedly chose to live a celibate life after his conversion. One slight problem: he was already married. He decided to divorce his wife so that she would be free to marry another. At his divorce, he reportedly said, &amp;ldquo;anyone who desires her may have her.&amp;rdquo; According to Lancaster, this is a relatively standard Jewish language for divorcing his wife to allow her to remarry.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So he what he thought was right but didn&amp;rsquo;t set out to start a heretical sect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, Gnostics, who did not know the Jewish context for the quote and were infamous for twisting words, did exactly that. In their view, the quote was, &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;everyone&lt;/strong&gt; who desires her may have her.&amp;rdquo; The Nicolaitans, these Nicholas-followers, were permissive in all things, notably sexual impropriety, even though they professed faith in Jesus as their savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, the story reads like it is contrived. It&amp;rsquo;s as if someone said, &amp;ldquo;The Gnostics are bad. Let me tell you how bad they are…&amp;rdquo; and then made up this story about Nicholas to connect the evil Gnostics to the mysterious Nicolaitans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, this is probably the leading candidate from a 1st-century context perspective. But there is one other that is intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;conjecture-3-a-heretical-sect-that-claimed-the-jewish-dietary-laws-were-done-away-with&#34;&gt;Conjecture #3: A heretical sect that claimed the Jewish dietary laws were done away with&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rationale: Nicolaitans νικολαιτων is a &amp;ldquo;Hebraism&amp;rdquo;: a transliteration of the Hebrew word &amp;ldquo;נֹאכֵל&amp;rdquo; (nochel - let us/we will eat!) made into a plural noun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, this was the &amp;ldquo;we will eat anything&amp;rdquo; sect. According to Lizorkin, the earliest mention of this theory is John Lightfoot (mid-1600&amp;rsquo;s). Still, Lizorkin claims, the view is &amp;ldquo;is consistent with Revelation as a Jewish, anti-Roman document&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and &amp;ldquo;would make a strong connection in the context of Balaam and Balak.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this view, these &amp;ldquo;nochelaitans&amp;rdquo; possibly said something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;we have freedom in Christ, don&amp;rsquo;t we? Therefore, we can eat whatever we want, and God will bless us.&amp;rdquo; They were the &amp;ldquo;we will eat&amp;rdquo; people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Numbers, Balaam and Balak ensnared Israel by sexual sin and a banquet of idolatry. The Israelites, believers in Israel&amp;rsquo;s God, somehow rationalized that it was ok to partake. In so doing, the Israelites brought God&amp;rsquo;s judgment upon themselves. Jesus says that whoever the Nicolaitans are, they are doing and teaching the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus mentions food several times and is specifically concerned about eating food sacrificed to idols. In the promise to the Ephesians, those who overcome will be allowed to eat from the tree of life (we can read that as PROPER food). The Ballam and Balak incident is about feasting on forbidden idol food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While, in some respects, this sounds like a &amp;ldquo;bear left&amp;rdquo; made-up story, Lizorkin believes this view &amp;ldquo;makes more sense in the natural Jewish context&amp;rdquo; (than the other presumed definitions of Nicolaitans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, all three conjectures are educated guesses. Ultimately, we can&amp;rsquo;t prove who the Nicolaitans were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;nicolaitans-summary&#34;&gt;Nicolaitans summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three conjectures for the Nicolaitans share a common theme: they were a group of people who said, &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;re doing it our way,&amp;rdquo; despite what the Bible says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember the second question we asked at the beginning of this discussion? &amp;ldquo;How do we know we are not Nicolaitans?&amp;rdquo; The Nicolaitans were professing believers that had intentionally or unintentionally gotten off track. Maybe a third question we could ask is, &amp;ldquo;Did the Nicolaitans know Jesus hated their deeds before hearing John&amp;rsquo;s letter to Ephesus?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to think they were surprised. Most cult members sincerely believe in their cult&amp;rsquo;s teachings. One can be sincere in his beliefs and still be very wrong. This means that unknowingly there could be Nicolaitans (at least in the broad sense of Jesus hating their deeds) among us. Indeed, if we have strayed, ever so slightly from Jesus&amp;rsquo; teachings, WE could also be doing the deeds of the Nicolaitans. Often a cult starts by taking a truth and overemphasizing it to the point of error. For example, many Christians today say, &amp;ldquo;I can do anything because Paul said, &amp;lsquo;all things are lawful.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; The problem with this view is that it is out of context. In 1 Corinthians 6:12, Paul is quoting an argument of his opponents. Most assuredly, all things are NOT lawful for believers. The Bible calls us to be set apart from the world around us. Society is, of course, trying to tell the church that all kinds of sexual behavior (heterosexual promiscuity and otherwise) should be tolerated. Still, the Bible tells us to be set apart from the world around us, and that marriage is between one man and one woman forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many conservative Christians know that sexual sin is terrible, but we don&amp;rsquo;t think about what we eat. Perhaps the matter is not as cut and dry as we may think. Jesus links food and sexual appetites. We are supposed to be called out from non-believers and, according to the apostles, our diet is one way we do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a question to see whether there are traces of Nicolaitanism in us: if God gave us a command, but He didn&amp;rsquo;t provide what we thought was a &amp;ldquo;good reason,&amp;rdquo; what would we do? Would we obey as an act of devotion, or would we insist on doing it our way? Doing it our way is the teaching of the Nicolaitans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard a story of a Jew who said something to the effect of &amp;ldquo;Lord, if it were up to me, I would eat the delicious pig. But because you prohibit it, I will honor you and not eat the delicious pig.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may wonder why Jesus would care what we do, provided we believe in our hearts. I can&amp;rsquo;t speak for Jesus&amp;rsquo; reasons, but I only know that He does care. In some sense, everyone He chastises in these letters presumably had their &amp;ldquo;hearts in the right place.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our question is, &amp;ldquo;how will I choose to serve Him today?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;hate-the-sin-love-the-sinner&#34;&gt;Hate the sin; love the sinner.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note how Jesus says, &amp;ldquo;you hate what they do,&amp;rdquo; not &amp;ldquo;you hate the Nicolaitans as people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to get that backward – we hate the person but wink at the sin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(7) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.  To him winning the victory (or &amp;ldquo;him who overcomes&amp;rdquo;), I will give the right to eat from the Tree of Life which is in God&amp;rsquo;s Gan-`Eden.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 3:22-24 Then the LORD God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever—” 23 therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken. 24 He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life. Is 51:3 For the LORD comforts Zion; he comforts all her waste places and makes her wilderness like Eden, her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness will be found in her, thanksgiving and the voice of song.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;he-who-has-an-ear&#34;&gt;He who has an ear&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase can be said to be Jesus&amp;rsquo; signature line; it frequently appears in the Gospels and each of the seven letters. Recall what we discussed in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://talmidimway.org/commentary/revelation/2-greetings-rev-1-1-11/#rev-13-the-blessing&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;previous lesson about the Hebrew word שָׁמַע (shama),&lt;/a&gt; which implies putting what we hear into action, versus passively listening. Baruch says that this phrase means the messages are directed to the saved.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:21&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-overcomers&#34;&gt;The overcomers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each letter, there will be a promise made to overcomers, or as Paul might say, those who finish the race well. In the last four letters, the promise comes before &amp;ldquo;He who has an ear,&amp;rdquo; whereas the promise comes after in the first three. We aren&amp;rsquo;t told the reason for this inversion, but it is conspicuous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;tree-of-life&#34;&gt;Tree of life&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first mention of the Tree of Life is in Genesis 2:9. &amp;ldquo;The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.&amp;rdquo; Eve then Adam ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and their eyes were opened to sin. God intervened before they could eat from the Tree of Life. Otherwise, they would have lived for eternity in their sinful state. As we see in the verses above, God drove them out of Eden and then blocked the way back. Now fast-forward to the end of the story, and Jesus is ready to open that way back up again; however, we do not want to eat of the tree until our sin state has been fully addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned above, Jesus is apparently stating that there will be a group of people who think they are believers who do not ultimately eat of the Tree of Life. See Matthew 7:21-22 and Luke 6:46. Whether these people lost their salvation or were never really saved is immaterial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is supremely material is that 21st-century believers follow Jesus&amp;rsquo; instructions and make sure we are in the &amp;ldquo;overcomer&amp;rdquo; category. Our behavior matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, just as there are other Flood accounts, several different cultures, including the Babylonians, Assyrians, Hindus, Arabs, and Greeks have the equivalent of the Tree of Life in their legends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating implies fellowship. Beyond nourishment, the one who overcomes gets to fellowship with Yeshua and share in the Eternal Order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One central theme of the letters is not one of the assemblies viewed itself the way Jesus viewed it. The Ephesians believed that right beliefs and solid doctrine were all that was expected. Jesus demands our affection.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:22&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are the tie-ins to the conjectures mentioned in Lesson 5. Remember these are parallels in a broad sense and we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t hold too tightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name meaning: desired (one) or darling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Church age theory: Apostolic church (70-170)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pauline counterpart theory:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ephesians&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example: Eph 4:14 so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kingdom Parable theory: Four soils – Matthew 13:3-9; 18-23&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 13:3-9 He told them many things in parables: &amp;ldquo;A farmer went out to sow his seed. (4) As he sowed, some seed fell alongside the path; and the birds came and ate it up. (5) Other seed fell on rocky patches where there was not much soil. It sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow; (6) but when the sun had risen, the young plants were scorched; and since their roots were not deep, they dried up. (7) Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. (8) But others fell into rich soil and produced grain, a hundred or sixty or thirty times as much as had been sown. (9) Those who have ears, let them hear!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 13:18-23 &amp;ldquo;So listen to what the parable of the sower means. (19) Whoever hears the message about the Kingdom, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand it, is like the seed sown along the path—the Evil One comes and seizes what was sown in his heart. (20) The seed sown on rocky ground is like a person who hears the message and accepts it with joy at once, (21) but has no root in himself. So he stays on for a while; but as soon as some trouble or persecution arises on account of the message, he immediately falls away. (22) Now the seed sown among thorns stands for someone who hears the message, but it is choked by the worries of the world and the deceitful glamor of wealth, so that it produces nothing. (23) However, what was sown on rich soil is the one who hears the message and understands it; such a person will surely bear fruit, a hundred or sixty or thirty times what was sown.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time, we will look at Smyrna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In JOHN THE IMMERSER, Herod the Great’s sons have divided up the holy land, and the Holy Temple has fallen into the hands of a corrupt and Romanized priesthood. We turn our attention away from palaces and politics to seek a prophet, the voice of one calling in the wilderness. We find John the Immerser preaching on the other side of the Jordan River, near Bethany. John prepares the way through immersion and repentance. The waters of the Jordan River run with history and spiritual significance. Those waters have served as a place of renewal for the people of Israel more than once. The people seeking the prophet and his immersion must cross over its waters again to re-enter the land with a new heart and new commitment to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-word-on-the-lesson-title&#34;&gt;A word on the lesson title&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In messianic Jewish circles, John the Baptist is often referred to as “John the immerser.” The reason for this is the term “Baptist” has become somewhat of a charged term theologically (positively and negatively). Immersion reminds us that Christian baptism has its roots in Jewish ritual immersion in a pool of “living water” (either a spring-fed river or lake, or a cistern used to collect rainwater) and is not an entirely new practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-time-of-the-beginning&#34;&gt;The time of the beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Mat 3:1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Mar 1:1,4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luk 3:1-2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God…John appeared baptizing in the wilderness&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Augustus was the Caesar at the time of Jesus’ birth; in 14 he was succeeded by Tiberius. If we assume Luke is counting from the beginning of Tiberius’ reign as Emperor (which is only an assumption) 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; year would place us in 27/28. Other commentators use other dates to come up with anywhere from 26-30 CE/AD. This results in a crucifixion date between 29-33 CE being defendable. Often the date one picks for the start of His ministry depends on the bias one holds regarding a Friday crucifixion and the Daniel 9 prophecy – we’ll get to both of those questions much later in our study. Unless you need a topic for a PhD thesis in seminary, I recommend we hold dates VERY loosely there’s a lot of ambiguity with calendar conversions and dating methods. Luke says Jesus was ”about thirty” when He started his ministry – if He started in the year 28, he would have been in his mid-30s (remember He had to be born prior to 4 BC when Herod the great died).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The region of Judea, Samaria and Idumea was first given to Archelaus, who as we mentioned last time fits the modern definition of a train wreck. He was deposed in 6 CE and was exiled. At this time Rome brought in Governors or Procurators, All Rome asked of its citizens was “pay your taxes and don’t revolt”. The procurators were tasked with seeing to both things. The procurators were headquartered at the palace in Caesarea but tended to visit Jerusalem during the feast days where large numbers of Jews &lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:2.45972in;height:2.39375in&#34; /&gt;(most of whom hated Rome) congregated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of Jesus, the procurator was Pontius Pilate. Some scholars doubted Pilate’s existence until a stone with an inscription referencing Pontius pilate prefect of Judea was found at Caesarea. The stone was found in the theater at Caesarea upside down. Even back then they were into recycling. Pontius Pilate was appointed governor of Judea in AD 26/27, and he held the post until March of AD 37. This inscription was found in secondary use in the theater of Caesarea. A suggested restoration reads: “Pontius Pilate, Prefect of Judea, made and dedicated the Tiberium to the Divine Augustus.” The stone is the first and only mention of Pilate from an archaeological source. Today a replica is on display at the national park in Caesarea and the original is in the Israel Museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herod Philip had the northern districts including villages such as Bethsaida and Caesarea Philippi where Peter will later make his famous declaration. When asked “who do YOU say I am”, Peter answered, “you are the Messiah.” Jesus asks us that same question today and every day. In the Gospels, the scene at Caesarea Philippi is the high-water mark of sorts. Jesus would now begin to teach and repeat overtly that he would suffer and die. Both thematically as well as geographically, the rest of the gospels picture Jesus moving from Caesarea Philippi with Peter’s proclamation, which should have been EVERYONE’s proclamation, up to Jerusalem where he would be crucified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Herod that will give Jesus the most trouble is Antipas. Antipas was over galilee and the territory east of the Jordan called Perea. John the Baptist will accuse Antipas of adultery, and even the Jewish historian Josephus records that Antipas was politically threatened by John the Baptist. Jesus calls Antipas a “fox” in Luke 13 and they finally met face to face on the day Jesus was crucified. Jesus was before pilate being interrogated. When Pilate learned that Jesus was from Galilee, Pilate was concerned about a jurisdictional issue and had Jesus transferred to Antipas. Jesus said nothing to Antipas who mocked him and sent Jesus back to Pilate where he was given over to be crucified. Antipas would eventually be exiled just as his brother Archelaus was and replaced by Herod Agrippa I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Decapolis (which means “ten cities) were gentile territory where Jesus fed the 4000 and expelled the demons into the herd of pigs, which Chuck Missler affectionally labels, “the first case of deviled ham”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schlegel notes that “Jews were unhappy with this complicated arrangement of foreign roman domination.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In other words, Messianic hopes were high that God would correct this situation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster reports that between the time John’s father Zechariah served in the temple and the start of John’s ministry, the Romans began to sell the office of the high priest to the highest bidder, and of course, it only was awarded to those loyal to Rome. Annas was like a mafia godfather. Josephus records the political intrigue that resulted in Caiaphas being appointed High Priest, with Annas behind the scenes pulling the strings. The family controlled the high priesthood between 6 and 66. You know the saying about absolute power corrupting absolutely. These were the corrupt Sadducees and they virtually controlled the Sanhedrin in the days of Jesus and Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we get the idea that all of Jesus’ opponents were a single collective group – not so – the Pharisees tried to live their lives strictly by the word of God, so they detested the politically corrupt Sadducees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilderness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Judean wilderness between Jerusalem and Jericho is virtually uninhabitable apart from a few isolated monasteries first built in the Byzantine period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying “The word of God came to John” is linking John with the Old Testament prophets who received supernatural revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wilderness recalls the 40 years wilderness wanderings in Exodus. Lancaster: “Just as he led them into Canaan in the past, He will lead them from the wilderness into the Messianic Era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Lexham Geographic Commentary, Aubrey Taylor notes, “The wilderness paradoxically symbolizes chaos and distance from God, as well as a place for God to create new life and order. In the wilderness, God created a people and bound them to Himself, laying a foundation for the future nation. John likely believed he was initiating God’s return by enacting prophetic passages in a literal way within the wilderness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark begins his gospel narrative here, completely bypassing the birth and childhood events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark presents Jesus as the servant of all and focuses primarily on what Jesus did to serve mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essentially Peter’s gospel, and it moves like Peter did. Quick fire hits. We can imagine Peter dictating to Mark in Hebrew, while Mark translated into Greek, trying to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark does not have a genealogy because, as Missler says, “we aren’t interested in the pedigree of a servant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.3&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;3 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, “The voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.4&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;4 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Now John wore a garment of camel&#39;s hair and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.5&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;5 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.6&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;6 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.2&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;2 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, “Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.3&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;3 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight,’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.4&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;4 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.5&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;5 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.6&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;6 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Now John was clothed with camel&#39;s hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.3&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;3 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And he went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.4&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;4 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, “The voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.5&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;5 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall become straight, and the rough places shall become level ways,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.6&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;6 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;What do you say about yourself?” [23] He said, “I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as the prophet Isaiah said.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 3:2 says, “repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” This is John’s gospel message. It is also Jesus’ gospel message (Matthew 4:17) and it is also the disciples’ Gospel message (Matthew 10:2). Note the gospel message is not “believe in me so you can live however you want and still go to heaven when you die”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repent means return to God, literally it means to turn around and go the other direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kingdom of heaven, as interpreted by Rabbi Lichtenstein is “both the external state where Messiah reigns over the whole earth and the internal state of the individual who is forgiven and spiritually regenerated by the LORD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is at hand – the kingdom messianic age is about to begin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All four gospels say that John’s ministry fulfills Isaiah 40:3. The Isaiah passage begins with “comfort, comfort my people” (40:1) and then goes into the voice of one crying in the wilderness (40:3). God’s Comfort is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism and its Jewish predecessor immersion in a Mikveh carries a tie to ritual cleanliness and confession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the firstborn son of a priest, John should have been serving in the temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was either disenfranchised and pushed out by the corruption, or he voluntarily withdrew because he wanted nothing to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible does not tell us that he abandoned his priestly obligations, so we need to be cautious with inferring this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do have some suggestion that John affiliated with another group of disaffected priests known as the Essenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Essenes lived at Qumron and are presumed to be the authors of the dead sea scrolls. Qumron is located in the Judean Wilderness on the Northwestern shore of the Dead Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They opposed the sold-out, corrupted, Rome-loving, Hasmonean and Sadducean priesthood of Jerusalem.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars debate whether he was formally an Essene, merely was familiar with the Essenes and shared some similarities, or was not affiliated with them in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster writes, “John and his disciples are associated with, and at points, endorsed by the Pharisees; this would not have happened if John were a known Essene.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His attire alludes to Elijah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2Ki 1:8 They answered him, “He wore a garment of hair, with a belt of leather about his waist.” And he said, “It is Elijah the Tishbite.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jordan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the area of, and perhaps the exact location where Moses called the nation to make a covenant with the LORD and Joshua crossed the river and lead Israel into the promised land.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locusts &amp;amp; wild honey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 7:33 reminds us John was a Nazirite from birth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“John entrusted himself solely to God for his daily needs,”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which is reminiscent of the Israelites in the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deu 29:5-6 I have led you forty years in the wilderness. Your clothes have not worn out on you, and your sandals have not worn off your feet. [6] You have not eaten bread, and you have not drunk wine or strong drink, that you may know that I am the LORD your God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locusts could be insects or it could be carob pods from the locust tree, a tree that would have been available in parts of the Judean wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honey could refer to the syrup of dates and figs in addition to bee honey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John exemplified Jesus’ teaching on “do not be worried about what you will eat or drink” (Matthew 6:25)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His attire alludes to Elijah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John wore clothing that was not purchased in the markets of Jerusalem. John’s dress reminded the people of the prophet Elijah, who wore a garment of hair (2 Kgs Mark 1:8). Indeed, John came in the spirit and power of Elijah to warn of impending judgment before the Lord’s appearance (Mal 3:1-6; 4:5-6).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.7&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;7 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.8&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;8 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Bear fruit in keeping with repentance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.9&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;9 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father,’ for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.10&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;10 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.7&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;7 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; He said therefore to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.8&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;8 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Bear fruits in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.9&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;9 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.10&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;10 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And the crowds asked him, “What then shall we do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.11&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;11 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And he answered them, “Whoever has two tunics is to share with him who has none, and whoever has food is to do likewise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.12&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;12 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Tax collectors also came to be baptized and said to him, “Teacher, what shall we do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.13&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;13 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And he said to them, “Collect no more than you are authorized to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.14&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;14 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Soldiers also asked him, “And we, what shall we do?” And he said to them, “Do not extort money from anyone by threats or by false accusation, and be content with your wages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the seeker-friendly message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus will have a lot to say about bearing fruit during His ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say it often, but our works matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t do good works to get saved; we do good works because we already are saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A healthy fruit tree will bear fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are saved, there should be evidence of good works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By saying “Bear fruit in keeping with repentance” John is confirming that immersion must be an outward expression of an inward change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He didn’t see any fruit of an inward change, so he refused to permit the outward expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Matthew mentioning Pharisees and Sadducees we might get the impression that John is rejecting the religious and allowing sinners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why there is value of comparing passages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke makes it clear that John rejected ANYONE who was unrepentant, whether they were in vocational ministry or everyday folk such as soldiers and common folk, or vocational sinners such as tax-collectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 21:32 also references John ministering to prostitutes, which can include “fallen women” for any reason not limited to sex for hire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did not single out just the religious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What he is likely railing against here is what we might call “cheap grace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when the golden calf incident happened, God was ready to wipe the people out, Moses ”reminded” God of his promises to Abraham and God relented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, it became fashionable to rely on their familial connection to righteous Abraham to cover up sins in much the same way that Christians invoke the atoning sacrifice of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is when they invoke Abraham, or we invoke Jesus to exonerate us from personal responsibility.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we will note is the old adage whenever you point a finger at someone, there are three fingers pointing back at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we do this today? Do we ever say “well, I’m saved by Jesus so I’m forgiven”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we say that from a posture of contrition and repentance it’s absolutely true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we say it as an excuse to keep on sinning WITHOUT repenting, then it’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What shall we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After shooting painfully straight with his audience the faithful asked “what then shall we do?” There’s hope in this. None of us are beyond the father’s reach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John prescribes acts of lovingkindness, called chesed in Hebrew; these deeds achieve the spirit of the commandment to love one’s neighbor as one’s self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of note, John allowed them to stay in their occupations provided they conduct their lives with the highest standards of ethics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soldiers here are unlikely to be Roman soldiers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John’s ministry did not extend to gentiles and Romans would have had no interest in anything Jewish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given where he was (Perea), the soldiers were likely employed by Herod Antipas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These stones&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Joshua 4, God commanded stones of rememberance be placed to mark the moment where Israel was consecrated and crossed in to inherit the promised land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, the words for “stones” and “sons” only differ by one letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A possible point could be a warning for them to not rely on cheap grace. In other words, “don’t fool yourselves. There are plenty of genuinely repentant righteous people who produce good fruit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also a sense could be “be like the original generation who crossed at this location by faith.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Judaism, a gentile convert receives the title “Son of Abraham.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.11&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;11 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; “I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.7&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;7 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And he preached, saying, “After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.8&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;8 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.15&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;15 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As the people were in expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Christ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.16&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;16 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; John answered them all, saying, “I baptize you with water, but he who is mightier than I is coming, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Joh 1:19-28 And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?” [20] He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.” [21] And they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.” [22] So they said to him, “Who are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” [23] He said, “I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as the prophet Isaiah said.” [24] (Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.) [25] They asked him, “Then why are you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” [26] John answered them, “I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know, [27] even he who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.” [28] These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John’s message was that the Messianic Age was about to commence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This naturally led some to wonder whether John was the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In John 1:20, he says that he is not the messiah but is the forerunner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Talmud records, “a disciple must render to his teacher all the service that a slave renders to his master except that of loosening his shoe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John is saying “I’m not even worthy to be regarded as Jesus’ slave.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water vs Holy Spirit and fire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrival of Messiah has two different implications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the believers who repent and bear fruit (the righteous), Jesus brings an immersion in the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the unbelievers who don’t repent and don’t bear fruit (the wicked), the coming of Messiah brings judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book of Proverbs is our go-to reference when we study the righteous versus the wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the righteous, as it is today with Christian baptism, water is an outward sign that symbolizes spiritual regeneration in the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus Jesus says in John 3:5, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;th&gt;Matthew 3:12&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luke 3:17-18&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Reference&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.12&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;12 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.17&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;17 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.18&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;18 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; So with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mal 4:1&lt;/sup&gt; “For behold, the day is coming, burning like an oven, when all the arrogant and all evildoers will be stubble. The day that is coming shall set them ablaze, says the LORD of hosts, so that it will leave them neither root nor branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mal 4:5-6&lt;/sup&gt; “Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes. [6] And he will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the land with a decree of utter destruction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that day they would take a tool like a pitchfork and toss the kernels up into the air. The heavier seed would drop into one pile and the lighter chaff would be carried downwind into a separate pile. This was usually done on a plateau called a threshing floor. At the end the seeds would be gathered into a barn or a storehouse, and the chaff would be burned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew and Luke develop this theme of spirit vs fire with a quick one-verse parable, which we may call “the winnower, the wheat, and the chaff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winnowing fork = instrument of Messiah’s judgment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winnower’s hand = Messiah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threshing floor = Land of Israel/or the world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barn = the Kingdom of Heaven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheat = repentant righteous&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaff = unrepentant wicked - The image of the wicked as chaff is common in the Old Testament (Ps 1:4; Isa 40:24; Dan 2:35).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning: Messiah is coming to punish the wicked and reward the righteous. I, John, am bringing you this good news and therefore begging each of you to repent and do works of righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, John is the fulfillment (at least partially) of Malachi 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many believe Elijah himself is one of the two witnesses in Revelation 11, at which time Malachi’s prophecy would be completely fulfilled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John’s mission was to call God’s people to repentance and right behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it’s as if John is saying, “you can &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; me you’re repentant, but you need to prove it to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When things are going well it&amp;rsquo;s easy to trick ourselves into thinking that God must be really proud of our piety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all must turn to God for our provision. Again we don’t do good works to get saved, we do good works and bear good fruit because we are saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fruit of repentance is a life of good deeds that reflect our love for God and our love for our neighbors, just as Jesus instructs his disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yad Hashmonah Lesson 1/25/23:

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Ij9lbLpm1Q&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, the people and the places in the Bible can seem distant. After all, they were written thousands of years ago in a place that, for most of us, is thousands of miles away. &lt;em&gt;Yad Hashamonah&lt;/em&gt; is a recreated Biblical Village that helps us view our Bible in the proper context.  A place like this reminds us that the Bible describes real people and events that actually happened, and more importantly, God cares about them.  Yad Hashmonah teaches us that our great God who created the universe is still interested in the minor details of your life and mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our January 2023 trip, we studied Deuteronomy 8.  God desires a &amp;ldquo;good land&amp;rdquo; and blessing for His people.  He only asks for our obedience, which as we know is easier said than done.  While not a historical biblical site, the working village (called a &lt;em&gt;moshav&lt;/em&gt;) contains historically accurate reproductions of a synagogue, a winepress, a watchtower, a threshing floor, olive presses and burial caves. The garden includes olive trees, grape vines, biblical herbs such as hyssop, and a wheat field. When we read about these things, which are quite frequent in the Bible, our minds immediately can place three-dimensional objects on top of the two-dimensional text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;deuteronomy-87-14&#34;&gt;Deuteronomy 8:7-14&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of streams of water, of fountains and springs, flowing out in valleys and hills; a land of wheat and barley, of vines, fig trees, and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey; a land where you will eat food without shortage, in which you will not lack anything; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you can dig copper. “When you have eaten and are satisfied, you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land which He has given you. “Be careful that you do not forget the LORD your God by failing to keep His commandments, His ordinances, and His statutes which I am commanding you today; otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, and you build good houses and live in them, and when your herds and your flocks increase, and your silver and gold increase, and everything that you have increases, then your heart will become proud and you will forget the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-meaning-of-yad-hashmonah&#34;&gt;The meaning of Yad HaShmonah&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yad Hashmona” means Memorial to the Eight. The name was given by the Finnish founding members in memory of the eight Jewish refugees, who escaped in 1938 from Austria to Finland, and who were handed over by the Finns to the Nazi Gestapo in November 1942. The Finnish founders wished to somehow atone, on behalf of the Finnish people, for handing over the eight Jews to the Nazis. They viewed their contribution to developing the Land of Israel as an act of restoration and forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;winepress&#34;&gt;Winepress:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 21:33 “Hear another parable. There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and built a tower and leased it to tenants, and went into another country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/Day1YadHashmonah1.jpg&#34; caption=&#34;Winepress&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;threshing-floor&#34;&gt;Threshing floor:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruth 3:14 So she lay at his feet until morning, and got up before one person could recognize another; and he said, “Do not let it be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/Day1YadHashmonah8.jpg&#34; /&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;synagogue&#34;&gt;Synagogue&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 4:16 And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up; and as was His custom, He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath, and stood up to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/Day1YadHashmonah105.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Synagogue&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;rolling-stone-tomb&#34;&gt;Rolling stone tomb:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 28:1-2 Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the tomb. [2] And behold, a severe earthquake had occurred, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone, and sat upon it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read/hear the portions&lt;/strong&gt;:
Genesis 7:1-24&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/azTcRVrdm4c&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-71&#34;&gt;Gen 7:1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD said to Noah, “Go into the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that you are righteous before me in this generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heb 11:7 By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household. By this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 11:28 Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest (Heb. &lt;em&gt;noach&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew command “bo” can mean either come or go. “Come into the ark” seems to fit the mood of God’s providing shelter and security through this significant trial upon the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we noted last lesson, God could have elected to wipe everything out and start over. Instead, He chose to fix it. Tikkun Olam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice demands not only that the wicked be punished, but the innocent/righteous not be punished along with the wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, only Noah is described as righteous, not his wife or sons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They, presumably, were given a choice to follow Noah or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus a model for us is just as Noah’s family was saved on the basis of Noah’s righteousness, not their own, so too, if we follow Jesus, we are saved on the basis of His righteousness, not our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By virtue of being associated with Him and His righteousness, we are spared from the final judgment.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can take this a step further. Does today’s world scoff at the Bible’s description of the second-coming of Jesus who brings an end-times judgment? Did the larger world scoff at Noah when he was building the ark?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Pe 3:3-6 knowing this first of all, that scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing, following their own sinful desires. [4] They will say, “Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation.” [5] For they deliberately overlook this fact, that the heavens existed long ago, and the earth was formed out of water and through water by the word of God, [6] and that by means of these the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 24:39 “…until the flood came and took them all away. So will the coming of the Son of Man be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible uses flood imagery to describe the Tribulation period:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan 9:26 And the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end shall come with a flood, and to the end there shall be war. Desolations are decreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 12:15 The serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, to sweep her away with a flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-72-3&#34;&gt;Gen 7:2-3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2] Take with you seven pairs of all clean animals, the male and his mate, and a pair of the animals that are not clean, the male and his mate, [3] and seven pairs of the birds of the heavens also, male and female, to keep their offspring alive on the face of all the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional clean animals are needed for sacrifices after the flood.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an important insight. The Bible doesn’t provide every detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Text, clean and unclean designations do not occur until MUCH later (Lev 11:2-23).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, “somehow” Noah knows which are clean vs unclean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either God explained it to Noah directly, or perhaps He explained it to Adam, who passed it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, many (perhaps most) of the commands given at Sinai were not new to Moses. We might say they were codified as opposed to given for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has not yet been permission given to eat meat (that won’t come until Gen 9:2, and even there, no distinction is made between clean and unclean animals), so the assumption is that clean animals were needed for sacrifice, not man’s diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-74-5&#34;&gt;Gen 7:4-5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4] For in seven days I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, and every living thing that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground.” [5] And Noah did all that the LORD had commanded him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems more likely that God sent the animals to Noah, versus Noah going out and fetching them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish Targum says, “Behold, I give you the space of seven days; if they will repent they will be forgiven, but if they still will not repent, seven days from now, I will cause rain to come down upon the earth forty days and forty nights.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Blot out” is a good choice for the verb in verse 4. Some translations say “destroy” but “blot out” captures the essence of the word. Sinful man is to be violently erased without a trace, buried beneath the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-76-9&#34;&gt;Gen 7:6-9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6] Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came upon the earth. [7] And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons&amp;rsquo; wives with him went into the ark to escape the waters of the flood. [8] Of clean animals, and of animals that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps on the ground, [9] two and two, male and female, went into the ark with Noah, as God had commanded Noah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who have done the math calculated that Noah turned 600 in the same year Methuselah died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this we learn that “Methuselah’s” name was a prophecy. Mot = death; u=pronominal suffix meaning “his”; shelach = send or bring (forth). Methuselah means “his death shall bring,” as in bring forth judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year Methuselah died, the flood of waters came on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fact, the Talmud says the reference to “seven days” in verse 4 corresponds to the required seven-day mourning period; i.e., the rain began seven days after Methuselah died.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methuselah was the longest living person at 969, which is a picture of God’s mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People had almost 1000 years to repent and 120 years to get on the boat. They did neither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s mercy and patience are not infinite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-710-12&#34;&gt;Gen 7:10-12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:4.29653in;height:3.22222in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[10] And after seven days the waters of the flood came upon the earth. [11] In the six hundredth year of Noah&amp;rsquo;s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened. [12] And rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, the word for sky and heavens are the same – shamayim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A partial list of 40s in the Bible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flood waters (Gen 7:4, 12, 17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses on Mt. Sinai (Exodus 24:18) &amp;amp; Moses’ fasted during this time, just like Jesus did (Ex 34:28)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twelve spies scout the promised land (Numbers 13:25); Joshua, one of the spies, was 40 at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentenced to wander in the wilderness specifically one year for every day the spies were in the land (Numbers 14:34; Heb 3:9); also were provided manna and provision for forty years (Ex 16:35; Deu 8:4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;40-year periods of either rest or subjugation occur throughout Judges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goliath mocked Israel 40 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezekiel lay on his right side to bear the iniquities Judah (Ezekiel 4:6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, Ezekiel was told to lay on his left side for 150 days according to the LXX rendering of Ezekiel 4:4-5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Genesis 7:24 we’re told that after the 40 days of rain, the waters prevailed upon the earth for 150 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus fasted in the wilderness 40 days/nights being tempted by the devil (Mark 1:13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two general themes emerge from this list: trials/judgment/testing and God’s provision&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are occurring in the Flood narrative&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of models have been suggested:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ark is a type of Jesus. Just as those in the ark were saved, those who are in Jesus are preserved and provided for during the time of God’s judgment upon the earth; those not in Christ perish (1 Peter 3:21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who hold a pre-trib rapture see it slightly differently: Enoch represents a group of people who will be &lt;strong&gt;removed prior&lt;/strong&gt; to God’s wrath (said to be the raptured church), Noah and the Ark represents a group of people who will be &lt;strong&gt;preserved through&lt;/strong&gt; God’s wrath (said to be National Israel and believing “tribulation saints (perhaps those are one and the same)), and everyone else is the group of people who will &lt;strong&gt;perish&lt;/strong&gt; as a result of God’s wrath (said to be unbelievers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that Noah is “sealed” by God (i.e. sealed inside the ark) in verse 16, just like the saints are sealed by God during the tribulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enoch was “pre-flood,” not “mid-flood” or “post-flood.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fountains of the deep burst forth”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be easy to miss but the cause of the flooding was not exclusively due to the rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This recalls Genesis 1:6-7 and “the waters above” compared to “the waters below”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could refer to massive earthquakes resulting in the breakup and shift of continents, releasing subterranean waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have no idea what the earth was like before the flood, but we can surmise that it looked nothing like it does today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per the Bible Knowledge Commentary, “No doubt the surface of the earth, the manner of life, and the longevity of life were changed by this catastrophe.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler lists a number of “geological mysteries” that he speculates could have only been caused by the Flood:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grand Canyon, mid-oceanic mountain ranges, coal and oil formations, frozen mammoths in Siberia, fossil graveyards, and the apparent “jigsaw” fit of continents (for example South America and Africa) which are probably the result of horizontal compression/buckling.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-713-15&#34;&gt;Gen 7:13-15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[13] On the very same day Noah and his sons, Shem and Ham and Japheth, and Noah&amp;rsquo;s wife and the three wives of his sons with them entered the ark, [14] they and every beast, according to its kind, and all the livestock according to their kinds, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, according to its kind, and every bird, according to its kind, every winged creature. [15] They went into the ark with Noah, two and two of all flesh in which there was the breath of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.59306in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah’s sons are named but his wife never is named.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every mention during the flood narrative, Noah’s sons are always mentioned before his wife (6:18, 7:7, 7:13). After the flood, this changes (Gen 8:18).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also the three sons were living for 100 years before the flood. This would have been ample time to have children and grandchildren of their own yet there is no mention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either they didn’t have children or they did, but they declined to enter into the Ark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the latter option is true, it’s a reminder that no matter how closely you walk with God, your kids have free will and must make their own decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-716-17&#34;&gt;Gen 7:16-17&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[16] And those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him. And the LORD shut him in. [17] The flood continued forty days on the earth. The waters increased and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note Who closes the door. Why does the Spirit tell us this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah found divine protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joh 17:12 While I was with them, I kept them in your name, which you have given me. I have guarded them, and not one of them has been lost except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both Matthew 3 and Luke 3, John the Baptist, who baptized with water, said Jesus baptizes with the Holy Spirit and with Fire (Matthew 3:11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism with the Holy Spirit is the blessing for righteous believers in Yeshua,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism with Fire is the judgment of the wicked unbelievers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is eventually a deadline for making this decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while the door is open and anyone could have joined Noah’s family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.32153in&#34; /&gt;At some point, God will close the door and people will have made their choices as to which side of the fence to be on for eternity: Spirit or Fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This door application is not as much of a stretch as it might seem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following verses and Who said them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 3:8 “‘I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut. I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 3:20 Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 25:10 And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luk 11:7 and he will answer from within, ‘Do not bother me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luk 12:36 and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the wedding feast, so that they may open the door to him at once when he comes and knocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luk 13:24-25 “Strive to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able. When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, ‘Lord, open to us,’ then he will answer you, ‘I do not know where you come from.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joh 10:1-2 “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber. But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joh 10:7,9 So Jesus again said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for good measure, consider this description of Peter’s location immediately before he denied Jesus: Joh 18:16 but Peter stood outside at the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler: “The debate about alternative theological speculations ended when the door was shut.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if we want to talk about the fate vs free will discussion, here we see that God provides the door and God does the sealing but Noah had to respond in obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I see support for the Lutheran response to Calvin and Arminius:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are redeemed can only do so if they are called and sealed by God; no matter how righteous Noah was, he couldn’t save or seal himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are not redeemed have only themselves to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-718-20&#34;&gt;Gen 7:18-20&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.18579in;height:3.83519in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[18] The waters prevailed and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the face of the waters. [19] And the waters prevailed so mightily on the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered. [20] The waters prevailed above the mountains, covering them fifteen cubits deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Bible doesn’t generally claim to be a science or history textbook with every last detail, here the Divine Narrator is absolutely asserting a worldwide flood, not a local one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And the waters prevailed” is mentioned four times for emphasis (18, 19, 20, and 24).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the New International Commentary on the Old Testament, see “a poetic substratum underlying the Genesis narrative.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of the savagery of the storm and in the absence of navigational personnel or equipment (apparently not even a rudder), “the ark neither sinks nor capsizes.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-721-23&#34;&gt;Gen 7:21-23&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[21] And all flesh died that moved on the earth, birds, livestock, beasts, all swarming creatures that swarm on the earth, and all mankind. [22] Everything on the dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died. [23] He blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens. They were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word for breath is ruach, which is the same word for Spirit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only Breath/Spirit was with those inside the Ark; there was no Spirit outside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the poetic/artistic description of the destruction of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factually 23b is all we needed to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only Noah and those with him in the ark survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being an “instruction manual” for life, the Bible is to be savored and enjoyed as a masterpiece of literature that tugs at our emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only marine life and anything inside the ark survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to caveat that only marine life that wasn’t smashed into today’s fossils by the massive change in water pressure survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fossils of marine life (fish and sea shells) at high elevations, often in inland locations are another example of a worldwide flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Land animals have also been found fossilized in locations below sea level.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We presume dinosaurs and mammoths weren’t on the invite list and quickly drowned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler asks rhetorically how come there are no “new fossils” being discovered today?&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus says “as it was in the days of Noah” so it shall be at the end of this age (Mat 24:37-39).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-724&#34;&gt;Gen 7:24&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[24] And the waters prevailed on the earth for 150 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This narrative style is not like anything we are used to outside of the Bible (and it makes doing a verse-by-verse commentary a bit of a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost like sea swells, Verses 1-5 talk about entry into the ark, verse 6 talks about the flood outside the ark; verses 7-9 return to talking about entry into the ark, verses 10-12 go back to the flood happening outside, verses 13-16 we’re back inside the ark; verses 17-23a were outside; verse 23b we’re inside and verse 24 we’re outside again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This style is common with ancient epics and is called “resumption and summation”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Smyrna, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the First and the Last, who died and came alive again: (9) &amp;ldquo;I know how you are suffering and how poor you are (though in fact you are rich!), and I know the insults of those who call themselves Jews but aren&amp;rsquo;t—on the contrary, they are a synagogue of the Adversary. (10) Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid of what you are about to suffer. Look, the Adversary is going to have some of you thrown in prison, in order to put you to the test; and you will face an ordeal for ten days. Remain faithful, even to the point of death; and I will give you life as your crown. (11) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities. He who wins the victory will not be hurt at all by the second death.&amp;rdquo; &#39;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/b64ed3b008aa1110735d98ea971e72a5.png&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;Like Ephesus, Smyrna was a deep harbor town. This resulted in economic prosperity, though Smyrna was never as commercially significant as Ephesus. The map below shows Smyrna&amp;rsquo;s location respective to Ephesus and Pergamum. It&amp;rsquo;s about 42 miles north of Ephesus. Like Ephesus, the harbor eventually became silted over and the modern shoreline is a few miles to the west.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Ephesus, which tended to pick the wrong side during the great imperial battles of antiquity, Smyrna did not. In fact, they were steadfastly loyal to Rome. This was true long before Rome came to power. They built a temple to Roma, the deified personification of Rome in 195 BCE, when Smyrna was in Greek hands.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strabo, the great geographer of antiquity, indicated that the ancient Smyrnans believed their city to be the birthplace of Homer and had what they called a Homerium: a temple to Homer and a statue. Strabo also said that Smyrna was &amp;ldquo;the most beautiful city in Ionia.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern Turkish city of Izmir sits atop where we believe ancient Smyrna is. This has significantly limited archaeological excavation. Because of this, we are unable to confirm any Jewish/Christian presence in the city at the time Revelation was written. However as scholars will point out, &amp;ldquo;absence of evidence, is not evidence of absence.&amp;rdquo; Bolen points out the modern city of Izmir, &amp;ldquo;has a long history of Jewish residents, evidenced by the number of synagogues in the area of the historic city…at one time there were nine synagogues located on a single street.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of all the seven cities mentioned in Revelation, only Smyrna (Izmir) survives as a continuously inhabited city.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-roman-imperial-cult&#34;&gt;The Roman Imperial Cult&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Ephesus, the culture of Smyrna was deeply seated in the worship of what is called the Roman Imperial Cult. They were described as &amp;ldquo;being loyal to Rome and its gods, even unto death.&amp;rdquo; This is one of those likely local allusions (or maybe a better word is a &amp;lsquo;pun&amp;rsquo;) Jesus makes in Rev 2:10, when He says, &amp;ldquo;Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/0328930d97a78c3b85e84522af8a2260.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;30%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;We see an example of this in an inscription to Hadrian found at Smyrna. The dedication describes Hadrian as &amp;ldquo;Olympian, Savior, and Founder.&amp;rdquo; (Ὀλυμπίωι σωτῆρι καὶ κτίστηι).&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; By calling him &amp;ldquo;Olympian,&amp;rdquo; they are saying Hadrian is equivalent to Zeus. It is no accident that they used words challenging the status of Jesus as Savior. Even though Hadrian would have been after the time John wrote (this dedication dates to 128 CE), this is still illustrative of the culture the believers in Smyrna found themselves. Even though after the fact, labeling Hadrian as &amp;ldquo;founder&amp;rdquo; is in opposition to Jesus calling Himself &amp;ldquo;the First and the Last.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emperor worship was mandatory. The law required citizens to make an annual offering and acknowledge publicly that Caesar was supreme lord. They received a certificate that they had done so, after which they were permitted to worship whatever gods they wanted. As we have noted, ethnic Jews were in a protected class and exempted from this by law, but gentile believers were not. This led to significant tensions between Jews (both believing and non-believing) and Gentile followers of Yeshua, the Jewish Messiah, with the former group being called to publicly denounce the latter. The lack of &amp;ldquo;proper papers&amp;rdquo; showing this group refused to worship Caesar added to the pressure believers and those protecting them were under (remember in Nazi Germany, those who aided and abetted Jews were sent to camps or killed on the spot the same as the Jews they helped).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in Ephesus, there was a large area called an Agora that served as a civic forum and also had areas for shopping. All of this was under the watchful eye of altars to Zeus, Poseidon, Demeter, and Artemis. It appears that Cybele, the Phrygian mother goddess, was the patron goddess of Smyrna. According to legend, Cybele is the mother of Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. Numerous coins minted in Smyrna bear her image.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Today, we can see many arches that were built to support the Agora following the earthquake in 178 AD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another possible allusion in the letter occurs when Jesus refers to Himself as the one &amp;ldquo;who died and came to life.&amp;rdquo; Smyrna was destroyed and rebuilt multiple times, often by an earthquake. In addition to the quake in 178 CE, A significant temblor in 179 BCE destroyed much of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;new-testament-smyrna&#34;&gt;New Testament Smyrna&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Rev 2:8 is the only mention of Smyrna in the Bible, we believe Paul traveled to Troas passing through Smyrna and Pergamum, on his way to Greece as recorded in Acts 20. Paul also spent more than two years in Ephesus, so he could have made a trip to Smyrna. Acts 19:10 states, &amp;quot; This continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of the Bible, Smyrna is best known in Christian circles as the town where Polycarp was martyred. Polycarp was a disciple of John the Apostle and was the Bishop of Smyrna&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. A later tradition has Polycarp being betrayed by non-believing Jews, but this appears to be an anti-Semitic addition in an anachronistic attempt to libel the Jews with additional crimes against Christians and force-fulfill the prophecy in Revelation 2 regarding the persecution of the Smyrnan believers. History shows this persecution was at the hands of the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest records indicate that Polycarp was brought before the provincial governor. DeSilva writes, &amp;ldquo;the governor might not have known about the Christian faith, but he knew that it drew people away from giving the gods their due.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For this reason, this sect of the Nazarenes was an existential threat to the Roman way of life and had to be dealt with, &amp;rsquo;east of all by &amp;ldquo;Rome&amp;rsquo;s oldest and most faithful of allies.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The martyrdom of Polycarp records the dialogue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City official: What harm is it to say, &amp;lsquo;Caesar is Lord&amp;rsquo; and to offer a sacrifice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polycarp: For eighty-six years I have served Him, and He has wronged me in no way. How then, can I revile my King, who rescued me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this refusal, Polycarp was then attempted to be burned at the stake. The story goes that, like Shadraq, Mishaq, and Abednego in the book of Daniel, the fires danced around Polycarp but did not harm. When fire failed to do the job, Polycarp was then stabbed to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story – how much of it is true we don&amp;rsquo;t know – illustrates Jesus&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;no compromise&amp;rdquo; position to his faithful. No matter how bad things get, &amp;ldquo;even to the point of death&amp;rdquo; we must never deny Him. Conversely, for Christians, we know the end of our lives in this world is not the end of the story. Along with the story of Polycarp, the letter to Smyrna serves as a reminder to keep the heavenly perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(8) &amp;ldquo;And to the angel of the (&lt;em&gt;ecclesia)&lt;/em&gt; Messianic Community in Smyrna, write: ‘The words of the first and the last, who died and came to life.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 41:4 Who has performed and done this, calling the generations from the beginning? I, the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he Isa 44:6 Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: “I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god &lt;br&gt;Isa 48:12 “Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel, whom I called! I am he; I am the first, and I am the last.  &lt;br&gt;Rev 22:13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”  &lt;br&gt;Mat 2:11 And going into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. &lt;br&gt;Mar 15:23 And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. &lt;br&gt;Joh 19:39 Nicodemus also, who earlier had come to Jesus by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds in weight. &lt;br&gt;Isa 60:6 A multitude of camels shall cover you, the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all those from Sheba shall come. They shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall bring good news, the praises of the LORD. &lt;em&gt;(note: no Myrrh)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;myrrh&#34;&gt;Myrrh&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/b13284f70d65fa882b0f9370c6ea72d5.jpg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;Smyrna meaning: related to Myrrh, which is often used as an embalming ointment. As you can see in the photo, it starts out as a resin but must be crushed to activate its full potential. Is there a lesson for us as believers given what we are about to read? Smyrna was one of the chief exporters of Myrrh to the ancient world. We mentioned in the Ephesus lesson how many of the goods listed in Revelation 18 would have passed through the ports of Western Turkey. Myrrh is specifically named in Rev 18:13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myrrh was one of the three gifts the Magi brought at Jesus&amp;rsquo; birth along with gold and frankincense (Mat 2:11). Scholars see these gifts as prophetically speaking of Jesus as King (gold), Priest (frankincense), and His death as a prophet (myrrh, as most biblical prophets died as martyrs). We see it mentioned twice at Jesus&amp;rsquo; death. Once while He was on the cross (Mark 15:23, here used as an anesthetic) and another in John 19:39 when Nicodemus came to embalm Jesus after His death. Missler pointed out that in Isaiah 60:6, which describes the second coming, there will be gold and frankincense, but no Myrrh. His death is behind Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;description-of-messiah&#34;&gt;Description of Messiah&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The description of Messiah is taken from Rev 1:17-18: &amp;quot; “Don’t be afraid! I am the First and the Last, the Living One. I was dead, but look!—I am alive forever and ever!&amp;rdquo; The First and the Last is a frequent title of Adonai, whom we would call God the Father. It also occurs four times in Revelation, including twice with the addition &amp;ldquo;was dead and am alive.&amp;rdquo; This indicates that just as John 1:1 says &amp;ldquo;…and the word WAS God,&amp;rdquo; there is a blending of God the Father and God the Son. We have some other &amp;ldquo;First and the Last&amp;rdquo; references above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tribulation – θλιψιν (thliphsis)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/754c8fbe9bcebb37645299cdfe25539e.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;The root word for tribulation means simply &amp;ldquo;pressure&amp;rdquo;. It can be compared to the pressure used to extract juice from grapes or oil from olives. However, it does not necessarily have to denote physical persecution. As we mentioned above, believers in Smyrna clearly had to live their lives as a fringe group. They did not have religious protections like we do today (for now). They would have been ostracized, perhaps not able to hold jobs or purchase necessities, and likely were under constant threat of being arrested. Much of this would have been true for Jewish as well as Gentile believers in Messiah. Non-Jewish believers had the added pressure of being required to participate in the emperor-worship ceremony. Like Tom Bradford, a commentator, stated, &amp;ldquo;you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be beaten to feel beaten down.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being outside of the mainstream economy likely meant that many believers were materially poor. In fact, there are two Greek words for poverty: one means having nothing fancy, and the other means being destitute and reduced to begging. Jesus uses the second one, πτωχειαν ptocheia, here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus reminds them to have the heavenly view. From a kingdom perspective, they are rich. We&amp;rsquo;ve said before that a major theme of these letters is that the recipients didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily see themselves as Jesus sees them. This cuts both ways. Certainly, for the letters containing judgments, we can infer that this material deficiency in their faith that Jesus called out probably came as a surprise. In the same way, the believers of Smyrna thought they were poor, but they held the wrong perspective. We all need to have a kingdom perspective, no matter the circumstances of our earthly situation. Remember a simple motion of worshipping the emperor, which they could have faked, would have given them their papers and alleviated most of the suffering. Were some of them second-guessing that decision? Jesus affirms they made the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Antisemitic interpretations of 2:9&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I need to say how thankful I am for the work of Chuck Missler. While he wasn&amp;rsquo;t perfect in all his analyses (indeed none of us are), he took a firm stance against Replacement Rheology. In the early 90s, shortly after I came to faith, a co-worker told me I had to listen to Chuck. He was on the radio in Orange County every afternoon at 4. He labeled replacement theology what it was: a heresy that should have no place in our churches. Replacement Theology is the view that national Israel has been &amp;ldquo;replaced&amp;rdquo; by the church and that all the promises made to the nation, most of which were unconditional, have been forfeited. This view makes God a liar. This heresy took root early on and the church has had a long history of antisemitism. The atrocities against the Jews under the banner of &amp;ldquo;Christ&amp;rdquo; sicken the stomach. Honestly, if I were a traditional Jew and knew this history, I would want nothing to do with Christianity either. This has also been a tragedy for the church as we have disconnected ourselves from the Jewishness of our faith (last time I checked, our founder was an observant Jew!) and we have also discounted the value of the Old Testament, which is over 2/3 of God&amp;rsquo;s Word that we claim to hold as inerrant. The only bad thing about my being taught to avoid this from practically day 1 of my walk with Jesus is that I was thoroughly unprepared for how pervasive this view is in the church today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point in this preface is that if you come across a definition of &amp;ldquo;Jews who are not&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;synagogue of Satan&amp;rdquo; as referring to all non-believing Jews throughout history, you need to know this interpretation is from the enemy – even if the commentator is a believing Christian with the best of intentions. The term &amp;ldquo;synagogue of Satan&amp;rdquo; has become a favorite anti-semitic slur. None other than Billy Graham used this term as an anti-semitic racial slur in a recorded conversation with President Nixon in 1972.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lizorkin elaborates: &amp;ldquo;the standard interpretation forces the reader to use later anachronistic categories while reading first-century texts,&amp;rdquo; namely Christians reading Jewish persecution into the story of Polycarp (which itself happened many decades after the letter to Smyrna), when this version of the facts is dubious at best. &amp;ldquo;History helps, but only if it is contemporaneous to John&amp;rsquo;s words.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Lizorkin and other commentators have noted antisemitic bias on the part of bible translators. In James 2:2, the word sunagogeh is used but it is rarely if ever translated as synagogue. Translators prefer &amp;ldquo;assembly&amp;rdquo; when the word is neutral or positive. In other words, &lt;em&gt;sunagogeh&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ecclesia&lt;/em&gt; mean exactly the same thing. They are synonymns. However, when sunagogeh has a negative connotation as it does here in Rev 2:9, they choose &amp;ldquo;synagogue&amp;rdquo; as it brings to mind a uniquely Jewish affiliation. As we have pointed out, the early &amp;ldquo;Christians&amp;rdquo; met in synagogues through the early second century at the earliest, possibly even longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with all of this lengthy preface, let&amp;rsquo;s come up with a non Replacement Theology position on &amp;ldquo;those who call themselves Jews but aren&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Synagogue of Satan.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to avoid antisemitism with this verse? Absolutely. All we have to do is simply follow the primary rule of Bible interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary Rule of Bible Interpretation: When the plain sense of Scripture makes common sense, seek no other sense (or you&amp;rsquo;ll end up with a pretense that is likely nonsense).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, as Dr. Fructenbaum says, &amp;ldquo;we take every word at face value unless the facts or immediate context CLEARLY indicate otherwise. A literal interpretation does not rule out figures of speech but even these have a literal background.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This is a rule that if you ask every serious Bible commentator, they will agree with it. Yet MOST of these same commentators completely throw this out the window when it comes to prophesy in general, and these two verses regarding the Jews specifically. They will concoct some scheme that it is true Jews who are not are really Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the letter to Ephesus, we had a nearly identical phrase, &amp;ldquo;those who call themselves apostles (Christians) but are not.&amp;rdquo; In that case, the meaning was seemingly obvious. These people are imposters. They claim to be Christians, but their behavior tells a different story. They are Christians in name only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the only question to ask is &amp;ldquo;what is the plain sense reading of &amp;rsquo;those who call themselves Jews but aren&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rdquo;? Answer: these are people who are NOT Jews. They are imposters, being dishonest about their affiliation. They claim to be Jews, but their behavior tells a different story. They are Jews in name only. And in this case, this group of imposters is slandering the believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was that so hard? I am baffled why commentators go to great lengths to allegorize this passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, do we already have an example &lt;em&gt;from scripture,&lt;/em&gt; of such a group of people calling themselves Jews but not acting like Jews? As a matter of fact, yes. John 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joh 8:39-44 They answered him, “Abraham is our father.” Jesus said to them, “If you were Abraham&amp;rsquo;s children, you would be doing the works Abraham did, (40) but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did. (41) You are doing the works your father did.” They said to him, “We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father—even God.” (42) Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but he sent me. (43) Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word. (44) You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father&amp;rsquo;s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we discussed in Gospel Backgrounds, Jesus is not speaking to or about all Jews in John 8. He is not even speaking to all Pharisees. He is speaking to a narrow subset of Pharisees who were involved in a plot to kill him. We can prove that not all Pharisees are implicated because there were several Pharisees who believed in Jesus - namely Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea. As an aside, there is some historical reason to believe that Jesus might not have been speaking to any Pharisees here, but general members of the Jerusalem corrupt temple establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Jews were not responsible for His crucifixion. It occurred very early in the morning on a feast day. The vast majority of Jews were at home, probably sleeping. No, this was a sly crime at the hands of very few, probably much fewer than we may realize. Tens of thousands of Jews came to faith after the Resurrection and thousands of Jews are coming to faith in Yeshua as their messiah today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it is wholly incorrect to say that the Jews who are not, refers to all Jews throughout history. We know that Rev 2:2 is not speaking about all Christians. Just as there are corrupt Christians whom we might call Christians in Name only, there were and are corrupt Jews who are &amp;ldquo;Jews in name only&amp;rdquo; but who really have Satan, the accuser as their father. Therefore, Jesus is basically saying that their father is not Abraham but Satan, and they don&amp;rsquo;t worship in a proper synagogue, but a Synagogue devoted to their father. Not necessarily one filled with satanic rituals as we might think of them, but one built on accusations, such as informing against one&amp;rsquo;s brethren to the authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Lancaster, informing and accusing one&amp;rsquo;s neighbor is expressly prohibited by the Torah. Jews who were doing this were behaving exactly like the Jews Jesus was contesting in John 8. They were not upholding the high ethical standards God expects of His followers.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Leviticus 19:18 says to love your neighbor as yourself. While Jews debated as to who their neighbor was (see the Good Samaritan parable), unquestionably fellow Jews and gentiles who worshipped alongside each other in Synagogue would have been their neighbor whom they were to love, not accuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other views that are equally plausible. Lizorkin sees fake converts trying to avoid persecution.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This view fits given Jesus&amp;rsquo; command to hold fast. This group caved and perhaps renounced Jesus, if only for show. Fructenbaum sees Rome and their anti-Messiah emperor as impersonating the one true God and His Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is not correct is to affix this label to those who really are Jewish and have done nothing to disavow that status. Also keep in mind that as of this letter, there was no separate Gentile Christian religion separate from Judaism. Jesus and Paul both make it clear that the Kingdom is for the Jew first. We gentiles are included only by God&amp;rsquo;s grace. Paul even warns us not to become proud (and our inclusion is supposed to provoke them to jealousy, not make them want to have nothing to do with us!). I encourage a careful study of Romans 9-11.&lt;/p&gt;

will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;judgment-but-i-have-this-against-you-omitted-for-smyrna&#34;&gt;Judgment &amp;ldquo;But I have this against you&amp;rdquo;: OMITTED FOR SMYRNA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our lesson on the sevenfold structure, we mentioned that the standard outline for these letters has seven elements including a section on Judgment. That is the rule, but there are two exceptions. Smyrna is one of the two cities that receives no Judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep this in mind whenever we are going through a trial. We often feel as if God has abandoned us and maybe feel that we must have done something for God to judge us by sending us this trial. The letter to Smyrna corrects that thinking. Just because there is tribulation doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that it is God&amp;rsquo;s judgment. In Smyrna&amp;rsquo;s case it clearly was not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Lizorkin points out, the concept of things not truly being as they appear is a trademark of apocalyptic literature.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As we mentioned in the early lessons, a reason for God giving a revelation was to communicate that even though things seem bad on earth, God is still in control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(10) Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid of what you are about to suffer. Look, the Adversary is going to have some of you thrown in prison, in order to put you to the test; and you will face an ordeal for ten days. Remain faithful, even to the point of death; and I will give you life as your crown.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fear not&amp;rdquo; ~150x 2Ti 3:12 And indeed, all who want to live a godly life united with the Messiah Yeshua will be persecuted,   Jas 1:2-3 Regard it all as joy, my brothers, when you face various kinds of temptations; (3) for you know that the testing of your trust produces perseverance.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not fear is a major theme of Revelation. Even though things are bad, do not fear. In fact, things are going to get worse. Even though you may be unjustly thrown in jail, do not fear. Even though you may die, do not fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus reminds them that it is Satan, the accuser or the adversary who is behind all of this. We only see earthly combatants, but God shows us there is a much bigger picture spiritually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars don&amp;rsquo;t know what the &amp;ldquo;ten days&amp;rdquo; means. If we take it literally, there could have been a period of ten days where there was a wave of intense persecution. This would be something like a pogrom.  Others, particularly those who hold to the Church Age theory, see ten Roman Emperors who specifically persecuted believers.  See callout below for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;10 Roman Emperors?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proponents of the church-age theory see a list of ten Roman emperors between 50-311 who persecuted the church&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;54-68 Nero (Paul and Peter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;95-96 Domitian (John (attempted, then exiled))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;104-117 Trajan ( Ignatius)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;161-180 Marcus Aurelius (Polycarp)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200-211 Septimus Severus (Iraneus)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;235-237 Maximinus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;249-251 Decius&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;257-260 Valerian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;270-275 Aurelian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;303-311 Diocletian (worst of all!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Foxe&amp;rsquo;s book of Martyrs, it is reported that 5 million believers died for Christ during this period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The priests of the various deities in Smyrna wore a laurel (crown of leaves) in honor of their service. Jesus says His faithful will receive a crown in honor of their service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(11) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities. He who wins the victory will not be hurt at all by the second death.&amp;quot; &#39;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev_20:6 Blessed and holy &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years. Rev_20:14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. Rev 21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will find out more about the second death once we get to Revelation 20. There is a quip attributed to DL Moody, &amp;ldquo;born twice, die once; born once, die twice.&amp;rdquo; Born-again believers are spared the second death, while the unrepentant are not born again get to die once on this earth and then will be cast into the second death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we move on to our three speculation areas: the church age theory, the Pauline letter tie in and the parable tie in. Proponents of the church age theory see Smyrna as representative of the Persecuted church from 170 to 312, as exemplified by the 10 Roman emperors with state sponsored persecution we listed earlier. This all came to an end with the edict of Toleration (Christianity decriminalized if we want to look at it that way) around 311 between Emperors Galerius and Constantine (yes there were two. There were actually three). The full legalization of Christianity occurred in 313, but that ushered in a whole new set of problems which we&amp;rsquo;ll get to when we look at the church of Pergamum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;25 but while people were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, then went away.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;26 When the wheat sprouted and formed heads of grain, the weeds also appeared.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;27 The owner&amp;rsquo;s servants came to him and said, &amp;lsquo;Sir didn&amp;rsquo;t you sow good seed in your field? Where have the weeds come from?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;28 He answered, &amp;lsquo;An enemy has done this.&amp;rsquo; The servants asked him, &amp;lsquo;Then do you want us to go and pull them up?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;29 But he said, &amp;lsquo;No, because if you pull up the weeds, you might uproot some of the wheat at the same time.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;30 Let them both grow together until the harvest; and at harvest-time I will tell the reapers to collect the weeds first and tie them in bundles to be burned, but to gather the wheat into my barn.&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1:14 And most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1:18-21 What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice, (19) for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, (20) as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. (21) For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1:27-28 Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel, (28) and not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1:29 For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;2:2 complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;2:3-4 Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. (4) Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. (speaks to the importance of being who you say you are – if say we follow God, we need to act like it).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;2:7-8 but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. (8) And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;2:15-16 that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, (16) holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. (and get your crown!)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;2:17 Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;3:7 But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;3:10-11 that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, (11) that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;3:14 I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;3:20-21 But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, (21) who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;4:4-8 Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice. (5) Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand; (6) do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. (7) And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. (8) Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;4:13 I can do all things through him who strengthens me.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Lastly, Php 4:22 states, &amp;ldquo;All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar&amp;rsquo;s household.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/dt&gt;

      <title>7. Immersion and Temptation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In IMMERSION AND TEMPTATION, we briefly return to &lt;strong&gt;Nazareth&lt;/strong&gt;. More than two decades have elapsed since we last visited. Yeshua is no longer a precocious twelve-year-old boy; he is a grown man who has taken over His father Joseph’s carpenter trade. From Nazareth, we follow Yeshua’s family to the plains of the &lt;strong&gt;Jordan&lt;/strong&gt;, across from Jericho, where John the Immerser is at work, proclaiming the good news and immersing for repentance&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. After His immersion, we follow Yeshua out into the dry and waterless &lt;strong&gt;Judean&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Wilderness&lt;/strong&gt; between &lt;strong&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jericho&lt;/strong&gt; where He spends forty days in prayer and fasting, concluding with His three temptations.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passages&lt;/strong&gt;: Matthew 3:13-4:11 (Mark 1:9-13, Luke 3:21-23, 4:1-13; John 1:29-34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:90%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This map&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; traces Jesus’ early ministry, including leaving Nazareth to be baptized by John (Mark 1:9) leading to His baptism in the Jordan (box 1), followed by His temptation in the Judean wilderness (box 2). We don’t know exactly where (or when) Jesus was baptized. Because of a few references, including the apparent proximity to Jerusalem (Mark 1:5) and the reference to “these stones” in the Luke and Matthew accounts suggest opposite Jericho near (or quite probably at) the location where Joshua led the Israelites across in Joshua 4. This site is marked by a traditional holy site today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not disputing a southern location for Jesus’ baptism, some scholars, including William Schlegel the publisher of this map, contend “Bethany beyond the Jordan” is not located across from Jericho but much further north in the Golan Heights (marked by box 3 on the map). They point out that it does not say that Jesus was baptized at Bethany; but in John’s gospel, it appears as if John is recollecting Jesus’ baptism which occurred at least 40 days earlier and in a different location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aubrey Taylor has noted that in the same region where Moses commissioned Joshua, and Elijah commissioned Elisha, Jesus receives a similar commission from John.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The photo on the bottom&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is the same area today. The most significant issue in that part of the world, since ancient times and continues today is water rights. Before 1948 the area was sparsely populated. After 1948 with the founding of both the modern states of Israel as well as Jordan, the area began to grow, and all those new people needed food and food requires water from the Jordan river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-baptized-by-john-in-the-jordan&#34;&gt;Jesus baptized by John in the Jordan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mat 3:13-15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mar 1:9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John 1:29-31&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. John would have prevented him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?” But Jesus answered him, “Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he consented.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! This is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who ranks before me, because he was before me.’ I myself did not know him, but for this purpose I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it’s only a few verses in our Bibles, we need to remember that John and Jesus had probably never met until this day (and unlikely that John would remember doing a somersault in his mother Elizabeth’s womb over 30 years earlier); however, John 1:31 could also be interpreted that John initially did not recognize that Jesus was the Messiah, not that they were entirely unfamiliar with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, by now, we presume Joseph has died and Jesus has been left in charge of Mary and Jesus’ many siblings. John apparently recognized Jesus as soon as they saw each other and makes a Passover allusion to the sacrificial lamb and Isaiah 53:7: He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth. John is certainly foreshadowing Jesus’ suffering and crucifixion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster paraphrases Matthew 3:14 as, “I need to be baptized by you WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT, yet you come to me to be baptized with water?”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fulfill-all-righteousness&#34;&gt;Fulfill all Righteousness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Jesus Himself did not need to be baptized for his sins, so what does Jesus mean by “fulfilling all righteousness?” Keener notes that Jesus’ response indicates his identification with Israel in obedience to the Law and by extension, larger humanity who DID need purification&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. To fulfill all righteousness means it’s the proper way of doing things in the proper order. A prophet in the spirit and power of Elijah must arise, identify, declare, and anoint the Messiah (who must of course allow Himself to be anointed). By being baptized by John, Jeremy Dehut in Following the Messiah Jesus “testified to the authenticity and authority of John’s message and continued providing an example of faithful submission.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few lessons back we looked at how the verse “out of Egypt I have called my son” exemplifies how Jesus mirrors the nation. As we will see in the next section, Jesus’ 40-day fast recalls Israel’s 40 years in the wilderness. Just as God sustained Israel in the wilderness so He sustained Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we get to the question of why a Sinless Jesus would need a baptism of repentance, we must remember that Jesus is a perfect representative of the nation, just as He is a perfect and sinless representative of humankind. As a representative of Israel, Jesus “passes through the waters of the Jordan” just like the Nation did. His “repentance” (so to speak) represented the “corporate guilt and confession”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of His people. Taylor goes on to say that Jesus’ temptations can also be viewed in light of this representative role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.17&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; and behold, a voice from heaven said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; And a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.21&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.22&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, like a dove; and a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.23&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And John bore witness: “I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him. I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’ And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Psalm 2:7&lt;/sup&gt; I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, “You are my Son; today I have begotten you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen 22:2&lt;/sup&gt; He said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 11:2&lt;/sup&gt; And the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 42:1&lt;/sup&gt; Behold my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights; I have put my Spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:60%; float:right&#34; /&gt;When I visited Israel in February 2013, I took this picture of a pair of doves at Jesus’ traditional baptism site. I wonder if they were only there for the tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that day many believed that God had gone silent. So, the heavens opening and the spirit poured out indicated that the Messianic era had arrived. John earlier proclaimed, “the kingdom of heaven is at hand” (Mat 3:1). “A kingdom needs a king and a messianic era needs a messiah.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s voice and John’s prophetic testimony are the two witnesses required to establish a matter; in this case, the stamp of approval on Jesus as Messiah. The Spirit would signify that the Messianic era is at hand. The spirit resting on Jesus could be an allusion to Genesis 1, where the Spirit of God moved over the surface of the waters, and Genesis 8, where the dove flew out over the waters and, finding no other place to land, came to “rest” on Noah (noach means rest in Hebrew). Despite our impression of doves as docile and peaceful, they are notoriously territorial. Lancaster writes, “His disciples probably understood Him to mean a sudden, startling rush of wind – only slightly less jarring than being struck by lightning.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My beloved son” could also be read as “my son, the beloved” or even “my son, whom I love” which also recalls Genesis 22 when Abraham is told “take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love and go to the land of Moriah and offer him there as a burnt offering”. Isaac is a type or a foreshadow of Jesus who would be sacrificed, thus Lancaster notes in apostolic theology, the “beloved one” becomes a title for the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this seems to highlight the messianic prophecy of Isaiah 11:2 “And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon Him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 3:23 says Jesus was “about 30” when He began His ministry. We should not take this to mean exactly 30. The precise date of one’s birth was not especially relevant in the ancient world. Lancaster supposes that this is 28 CE, which if he was born in 5 or 6 BCE makes Jesus 34 years old here and then 36 years old when he died. According to Jewish tradition, Isaac was also 36 at the time of his binding on the altar in Genesis 22.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.4.2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing during those days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image5.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:80%&#34; /&gt;Bolen writes, “Because of its lack of water and good routes, the Judean wilderness&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; has been (mostly) uninhabited throughout history. Consequently, it was an ideal place for those seeking refuge from enemies or retreat from the world. John the Baptist preached here, and it seems likely that this was the wilderness where Jesus was tempted.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener writes, “Jesus was led into the wilderness just as Israel was led. Just as Moses fasted for 40/40, so did Jesus.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In fact, Mark 1:12 emphatically says the spirit forcibly drove Jesus out into the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is a shadow of both Moses and Israel. They were tested and God sustained them all. Jesus passed the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Christian traditions observe lent, where we abstain from certain pleasures, if not do a partial fast for 40 days between Ash Wednesday and Resurrection story. We do this in honor of Jesus’ 40 days in the wilderness. Jewish people similarly observe 40 days of Teshuva (“repentance”) which recalls the 40 years wandering in the wilderness (which is said to be one year for every day the spies were in the land). This concludes with Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement) which is a day of national fasting. Lancaster says, “Jewish liturgy treats the Day of Atonement as a day for dealing with Satan and his accusations. The liturgies of the day are filled with references to a legal showdown between Israel and the devil, which concludes with the scape goat being led out into the wilderness, symbolizing the defeat of evil.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars debate the moment in time when Jesus came to the full realization of His mission and destiny. Many speculate that it was at His baptism that the spirit descended. Lancaster speculates that the Satan’s temptations were an attempt to force Yeshua to question the revelation He just received. Maybe like in some movie where a normal person is given some superhuman ability, the Satan believes Jesus has the desire to try out His new superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three temptations will involve shortcuts to revealing His messianic identity and plan. Remember the phrase Jesus uses frequently between now and the triumphal entry: “My hour is not net come”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the first temptation is declaring that Jesus indeed trusts that revelation that He heard come from the mouth of the LORD. He did not need to prove it. Let’s break it down some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Satan begins with “If you are the son of God.” One of the main limitations of the written word is that we have to use our imaginations with respect to voice inflection and body language. Did the Satan say this scoffingly, inquisitively, or matter-of-factly? Since the Satan is the accuser, it’s not too difficult to imagine him taunting Jesus with this challenge. “Since we know God made manna from heaven in the wilderness if you are that God, you should be able to do the same thing in this wilderness. And by the way, I know you are hungry. Why don’t you just go ahead and fix yourself something to eat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus declines the invitation to demonstrate His messianic power. He will do it on His terms and in His timing. Jesus WILL provide bread, but it will be food for the people, not for Himself. He will serve others, not Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is the Word and the Bread of Life who has come down from heaven. He quotes Deuteronomy 8:3, which is a passage about how “God tested Israel in the wilderness by causing them to hunger and feeding them with manna.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Physical bread will temporarily relieve hunger but the Bread of Life, the very Words of God will cure spiritual hunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first temptation is declaring that Jesus indeed trusts that revelation that He heard come from the mouth of the LORD. He did not need to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.4.6&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, “‘He will command his angels concerning you,’ and “‘On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.4.7&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Jesus said to him, “Again it is written, ‘You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;9 And he took him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 for it is written, “‘He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you,’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 and “‘On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 And Jesus answered him, “It is said, ‘You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psa 91:11-14 For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways. [12] On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone. [13] You will tread on the lion and the adder; the young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot. [14] “Because he holds fast to me in love, I will deliver him; I will protect him, because he knows my name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deu 6:13-16 It is the LORD your God you shall fear. Him you shall serve and by his name you shall swear. [14] You shall not go after other gods, the gods of the peoples who are around you— [15] for the LORD your God in your midst is a jealous God—lest the anger of the LORD your God be kindled against you, and he destroy you from off the face of the earth. [16] “You shall not put the LORD your God to the test, as you tested him at Massah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we compare Matthew and Luke side-by-side we see that Luke reverses the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; temptations. Some may view this as the Gospel authors being unable to keep their stories straight, but another way of looking at it is that this demonstrates a lack of coordination and collusion among the authors. If one witness in a trial recalls she heard a dog bark and then a car horn, but another witness recalls she heard a car horn then a dog bark, we don’t typically assume one or the other is lying. It’s just a different recollection. The differences between Matthew and Luke are not significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is more significant is that leaping from a tall building is not typically a temptation to most people. The next matter is that before they were in the wilderness and now all of a sudden they are in Jerusalem. Scholars debate as to whether this is a vision, or whether they were supernaturally transported. I tend to vote against the vision. The leap has to be potentially fatal for the miracle the Satan is proposing to actually be miraculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a photo of the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The drop today is likely fatal but 2000 years ago, the Kidron valley below was much steeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a reminder that the Satan knows Scripture and he is an expert at making arguments. We need to be like Jesus and know the “whole council” of God so we don’t take Bible passages out of context, and don’t fall for it when others try to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Satan says, “look here. God says He will send His Psalm 91 angels to protect you.” Psalm 91 is a messianic passage (and the Satan knows this). Psalm 91 is a great passage and one we all would do well to memorize and rely on. However, a Tzaddiq (a righteous one) such as Jesus would have known that angelic protection is for ills that befall God’s servants, not for those who foolishly seek out danger. Therefore, we must know our Bible, and therefore we are going through the Gospels verse by verse in this series!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus counters with another passage from Deuteronomy. Note the context of “you shall not test the Lord” is not merely doing something foolish/sinful and asking God to make it right. The context is following after other gods spiritually. When we listen to the lies of the Satan, we are following after a false god. (ouch).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The testing at Massah refers to Exodus 17:7: And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the quarreling of the people of Israel, and because they tested the LORD by saying, “Is the LORD among us or not?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.4.9&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; And he said to him, “All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.4.10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Then Jesus said to him, “Be gone, Satan! For it is written, “‘You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;5 And the devil took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 and said to him, “To you I will give all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 And Jesus answered him, “It is written, “‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deut 6:13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan apparently is now convinced of Jesus’ messianic credentials, now offers Him a shortcut to usher in the Messianic Kingdom. Satan also likely knew the people were hoping for a conquering, military messiah. Here was a chance for Jesus to be this and skip all of that cross business. This might also be the Satan’s plea bargain; we make a deal here and I don’t go to the lake of fire later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer to Hebrews reminds us that Jesus “has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin” (Hebrews 4:15). As Missler used to quip, “If I offer to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge, are you tempted to buy it from me? Probably not, because you are relatively certain that I don’t own it. For this to be a valid temptation, that means Jesus is acknowledging that Satan has ownership of these things, and they truly are his to give away. Jesus doesn’t challenge Satan’s ownership.” One of the many subthemes in the Bible is what I might call “things out of place.” We opened the Gospels with King Herod ruling over the land, who was neither born king nor born Jewish. Herod’s power and riches were juxtaposed against the rightful king who came lowly in a cave surrounded by deplorable shepherds. In the last lesson, we saw John the Baptist, the son of Zechariah who officiated in the temple in Jerusalem. John, a Levite, should have been in Jerusalem at the temple but instead, we find him “exiled” to the wilderness, while the usurping Sadducees are running the Temple. Here, the world that rightly belongs to God is under the authority of the Satan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t know which mountain. Mt. Nebo would have been nearby in the wilderness. Mt. Nebo is where Moses surveyed the land. Others have suggested Mt. Hermon in the far north of Israel and is the highest peak in the land of Israel. Mt. Hermon is intriguing because of its association with demonic activity in antiquity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;worship-me&#34;&gt;Worship me&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Satan said, “worship me,” he wasn’t necessarily asking Jesus to change His mind and start following Satan with His whole heart (although he certainly could have been). During the days of the seven churches in Revelation, Rome generally let people, particularly Jews, practice their religion without interference (depending on who was in charge). But often what they had to do was, one day a year, offer a sacrifice to the emperor. In the seven letters, Jesus sternly chides those who are compromising in this way. This is still idolatry, no matter how seemingly insignificant the idolatrous act is. Conversely, Jesus lavishly praises those in Smyrna and other cities who kept themselves pure from idolatry. In fact, the Bible uses an interesting metaphor for idolatry: adultery. Idolatry is spiritual fornication and unfaithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a story of a mother who caught her child doing something and the response was “mom, I only did it once and it was only a little. I’m ok.” A few days later the mom made a batch of brownies and the son of course got very excited. He took one bite and the happiness immediately gagged. “What’s wrong honey,” said the mom. “These taste awful,” said the son. “What happened?” “Hmm that’s strange,” said the mom. “I only put a little bit of dog poo in the brownies. Not even a teaspoon. They should be ok.” Point made. Jesus demands complete purity. There will come a day when Jesus will take proper possession of the things of the earth that are currently in the hands of the usurper. There will be no shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion-the-devil-departs&#34;&gt;Conclusion: the devil departs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mat 4:11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mar 1:13b&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luk 4:13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.4.11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and were ministering to him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13 And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13 And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark and Luke give us interesting tidbits. Mark says he was with the wild animals and Luke says the devil departed until “an opportune time.” We infer that opportune time was at the Garden of Gethsemane. The animals underscore the point that Jesus was completely isolated. Satan often likes to attack us when we are isolated from other believers. The photo shows the Ibex, a type of wild goat that is common in the Judean wilderness.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-from-the-temptations&#34;&gt;Lessons from the Temptations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus concludes each test the way any good rabbi would; He makes an appeal to Scripture. “As it is written…” should be a phrase we as Talmidim begin to use frequently as we continue to learn to be imitators of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three temptations parallel the warning given in 1 John 2:15-17: Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world. And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bread – desire of the flesh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kingdoms – desire of the eyes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throw yourself down and angels will save – pride of life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Satan is basically recycling the approach he used in the Garden: “So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food (flesh), and that it was a delight to the eyes (eyes), and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise (pride of life), she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate” (Gen 3:6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first Adam couldn’t resist the temptation, but the Last Adam did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Episode 3 of the “Following the Messiah” series covers the Baptism and Temptation of Jesus. It is very much worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;

Genesis 8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rain falls for 40 days and nights, and the waters churn for 150 days more before calming and beginning to recede. Then the ark settles on Mount Ararat, and Noah dispatches a raven, and then a series of doves, “to see if the waters were abated from the face of the earth.” When the ground dries completely God commands Noah to exit the ark and repopulate the earth. Noah builds an altar and offers sacrifices to God. God swears never again to destroy all of mankind because of their deeds.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genesis 8 is a straightforward narrative that is largely absent of any significant tension or drama. It provides a bit of a respite between the physical and emotional trauma of the Flood in chapters 6-7 and the familial mischief we will see in chapter 9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the livestock that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God did not forget about the guy on the barge with the floating zoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, saying “God remembered” is shorthand for “God remembered his promise/covenant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:29 – God remembered Abraham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:22 – God remembered Rachael, and God listened to her and opened her womb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exodus 3:24 - And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exodus 6:5 Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the people of Israel whom the Egyptians hold as slaves, and I have remembered my covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here God institutes the evaporative water-cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word for wind and spirit are the same: &lt;em&gt;ruach&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As wind does not directly cause water to subside, a deeper meaning might be that God sent the Holy Spirit to bring order and institute what we might call the laws of nature upon the newly redesigned planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to remember the context:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wind and ocean currents would have been entirely new experiences for Noah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He would soon find himself atop a 17,000’ mountain when before, we presume his environment was more tropical. (think altitude sickness and freezing temperatures/ice).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there was lingering seismic activity as the intense weight of water is removed from 1/3 of the earth’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure he was a bit unsettled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-82-4&#34;&gt;Genesis 8:2-4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained, and the waters receded from the earth continually. At the end of 150 days, the waters had abated, and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day of the seventh month, would be 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of Nisan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passover is always at sundown on the 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;/15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of Nisan (“between the evenings”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In AD 32, the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day of the month would have been a Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus was crucified on the 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, in the grave for three days, and resurrected on the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler, who supports an AD 32 crucifixion, suggests, “Noah’s ‘new beginning’ on the Plant Earth was on the anniversary – in anticipation – of our ‘new beginning in Christ!”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:100%&#34; /&gt;Ararat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must note that sometimes the name comes after the tradition and not before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text says the Ark came to rest in “the mountains of Ararat,” which would indicate that Ararat was a range, not a single peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, someone comes along and says, “yeah, it happened right here,” and a tradition is born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see the same with Mount Moriah in Genesis 22. There is nothing in the text that says Abraham went to Jerusalem; but later tradition places the event there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say the tradition is wrong; however. We just admit that we aren’t told from the text the precise location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern Mount Ararat (as in a single peak) is in the Lake Van region of eastern Turkey, near the border with Armenia and Iran.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17000’ in elevation and is difficult to get to because of the surrounding plains and ridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This location is attested several times in antiquity, including by Josephus, but the Gilgamesh flood epic has that ark coming to rest in southern Kurdistan.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several expeditions have been attempted with some claiming to find fragments of the ark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Divine Narrator made it a point to tell us that the Ark was pitched on the inside as well as the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally one only need pitch the outside of a wooden boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pitching both sides suggests a need for preservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-85-9&#34;&gt;Genesis 8:5-9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen. At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made and sent forth a raven. It went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth. Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground. But the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her and brought her into the ark with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A raven, as a scavenger, is an unclean bird while a dove, as an herbivore, is in the clean category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raven had plenty of dead stuff to eat so it didn’t need to return to the ark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dove, which has a much shorter and lower flight path, had no option but to return when there was no plant life in close proximity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in our day, a raven has sinister connotations (thanks in large part to Edgar Allen Poe), but throughout the Bible, birds of prey (which are all unclean) seem to represent ministers of Satan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the covenant ceremony between God and Abram, the Narrator adds this little tidbit: “And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away” (Gen 15:11). The suggestion is that Satan is attempting to interfere with the covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Parable of the Sower, Jesus describes the first type of seed: “And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them” (Mat 13:4). He then elaborates, “When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path” (Mat 13:19).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Noah thought “no great loss” if raven #1 never returned to raven #2 to multiply the species. Perhaps mentioning that “it went to and fro until the waters dried” is a way of saying it was still around when Noah released the other animals; therefore, the species was allowed to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must be fair to the poor raven though. In 1 Kings 17, ravens actually minister to Elijah: “And the ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the brook” (1Ki 17:6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We appear to have symmetry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;40 days/nights rain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;150 days waters increase&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;150 days waters abated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;40 days waters subsided&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking In His Dust&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we have sent someone on a mission, we should treat him kindly even if he is unsuccessful.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eph 4:32 Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason that makes studying the Jewish commentaries fascinating is the sages ask questions about the Bible that would never occur to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here they note that the dove did not fly back into the ark but only returned to the vicinity of the ark. It did not reenter until Noah extended his hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? (and you have to think creatively like a sage):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“having returned without anything in her mouth she thought her master would not allow her to come back inside. However, Noah had compassion for the dove and took her in his hand to warm her while she rested from her journey.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application, though admittedly quite abstract with the case of Noah’s dove, is that people will let us down (and we will let others down) from time to time. Just as we would wish to be treated with compassion, so we should treat others with dignity and lift them up even when they fail us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a manager, I tried to live this out and a couple of times the offending staff member thanked me for the way we solved the problem. Unfortunately, I was less successful at doing this as a parent when my kids were little; but I’m attempting to live this out now. I guess the good news is that one of my boys, now in his 20s recently noticed the difference. He said, “wow. I thought you’d be really upset. You must be mellowing in your old age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loving your neighbor as yourself means extending mercy to others just as you would want mercy extended to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-810-12&#34;&gt;Genesis 8:10-12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He waited another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark. And the dove came back to him in the evening, and behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth. Then he waited another seven days and sent forth the dove, and she did not return to him anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good thing Noah had six more doves, or this might have been the end of the line for the dove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton suggests the olive leaf, in addition to being a symbol of peace and new life, provided Noah a clue as to the depth of the waters and how quickly they were receding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olive trees are notoriously resilient and tend to regenerate even if cut down.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olive branches and doves are universal symbols of peace. Olive branches are incorporated into the symbolism of the United States (juxtaposed against arrows of course – as if to say, “we desire peace, but don’t mess with us”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We remember that the spirit ascended upon Jesus “like a dove” (Matt 3:16), so there is a connection with the dove and the Holy Spirit. In Genesis 1 we were told that the spirit moved over the face of the waters, just as Noah’s dove does here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in verse 9, the dove found rest (noach in Hebrew means rest), just as the dove in Matthew 3 found rest in messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-813&#34;&gt;Genesis 8:13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried from off the earth. And Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be the day we know as Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year. Another new beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Rosh HaShana, the shofar (trumpet) is blown, “in anticipation of the coming of the Messiah and the resurrection of the dead.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In other words, this is a deliberate reference to the Messianic Era we studied in Revelation. Lancaster continues, “After the judgment has abated and the trumpet of the Messiah sounds, Jesus will usher in a new era and a new world.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-814-17&#34;&gt;Genesis 8:14-17&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth had dried out. Then God said to Noah, “Go out from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons&amp;rsquo; wives with you. Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh—birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth—that they may swarm on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the flood, the sons were listed before his wife; after the flood, we have Noah’s wife listed (but still never named).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m not sure what the significance of this is but whenever a pattern changes, we want to take note.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God will speak directly to Noah here and again in chapter 9. He won’t speak directly to a man again until Abram, ten generations and hundreds of years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as God called Noah to enter the ark, Noah patiently waits for God to call him out of the ark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is NOT what I would have done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to have God initiate a project and point me in the right direction; but then I’m quick to say, “Thanks, God. I’ll take it from here. I’ll let you know if I need help.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to be more like Noah and let God direct each step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-818-19&#34;&gt;Genesis 8:18-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons&amp;rsquo; wives with him. Every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out by families from the ark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are reminded that “Noah did all that the LORD had commanded him” (Gen 7:5).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-820&#34;&gt;Genesis 8:20&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Noah built an altar to the LORD and took some of every clean animal and some of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t have it recorded that God instructed Noah to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps God did instruct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Noah had the heart of a worshipper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike sin offerings or peace offerings, burnt offerings are usually associated with petitions or dedications before God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a burnt offering, the fire on the altar completely consumes the entire sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It represents a total surrender of the sacrifice to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-Jews only offer burnt offerings; gentiles (of which Noah is one) never offer sin or peace offerings.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-821-22&#34;&gt;Genesis 8:21-22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when the LORD smelled the pleasing aroma, the LORD said in his heart, “I will never again curse the ground because of man, for the intention of man&amp;rsquo;s heart is evil from his youth. Neither will I ever again strike down every living creature as I have done. While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Php 4:18 I have received full payment, and more. I am well supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Act 14:16-17 In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways. [17] Yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good by giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take the seasons for granted, but it was all new for Noah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Talmud delineates the six seasons listed in Genesis 8:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seed-time: October-November&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cold: December-January&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winter: February-March&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvest: April-May&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer: June-July&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heat: August-September&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the Flood didn’t fix man’s heart. In Hebrew, raq rah qol hayom. Only evil all the time. We are still a long way from the “It was very good” in Genesis 1:31.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While the earth remains” is an important clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jeremiah 32:25 God says He will honor His covenant with the Jewish people and His covenant with the house of David so long as the earth remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s patience with man’s evil will not last indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another reason why it’s awesome to study genesis immediately &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; studying Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After studying the last four chapters of Revelation, we now can contextualize a statement such as “while the earth remains.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our depraved sinful nature will rear its ugly head in Genesis chapter 9, which we’ll look at next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Pergamum, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the one who has the sharp double-edged sword: (13) &amp;ldquo;I know where you are living, there where the Adversary&amp;rsquo;s throne is. Yet you are holding onto my name. You did not deny trusting me even at the time when my faithful witness Antipas was put to death in your town, there where the Adversary lives. (14) Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: you have some people who hold to the teaching of Bil`am, who taught Balak to set a trap for the people of Isra&amp;rsquo;el, so that they would eat food that had been sacrificed to idols and commit sexual sin. (15) Likewise, you too have people who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans. (16) Therefore, turn from these sins. Otherwise, I will come to you very soon and make war against them with the sword of my mouth. (17) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities. To him winning the victory, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give him a white stone, on which is written a new name that nobody knows except the one receiving it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pergamum (aka, Pergamon or Pergamos) is inland about 70 miles north of Smyrna. Archaeologists believe the city was founded in the third millennium BCE. The town likely owes its beginnings to geography, as there is a conspicuous hill 900 feet above the valley below. It was once thought to be impregnable. Later, Lysimachus, one of Alexander the Great&amp;rsquo;s four succeeding generals, built a military fortification on this hill called an acropolis. Lysimachus also built Ephesus, and the two cities would vie for power and favor throughout the Roman period. Ultimately Ephesus, with its harbor, became the economic power, while Pergamum became the religious center. Since religion and politics were one and the same, Pergamum became the Roman capital of Asia minor.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The second photo shows a closer look at the acropolis with labels from Dr. Bolen. Note the theater with seating for 10,000 built into the hill. It is the steepest of all Roman theaters excavated in Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The library was massive by standards of the day with 200,000 volumes, barely second to the library at Alexandria, Egypt. Stiles notes that after relations with the Romans and Egyptians soured and the empire no longer had access to papyrus, Pergamum&amp;rsquo;s people developed parchment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;emperor-worshiproman-imperial-cult&#34;&gt;Emperor Worship/Roman Imperial Cult&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/468f7c93bbb74a67b807c9a9cf792d4e.png&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 250 BCE, Bolen writes, &amp;ldquo;Pergamum became a leading cultural center, especially in art and science. The acropolis underwent a massive restoration, and the Aesculapian was founded.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Missler writes that Pergamum &amp;ldquo;became the center of the official religion of emperor worship. The first temple of this cult was erected at Pergamos in 27 BCE.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In his commentary, Missler also traces several pagan myths founded in Babylon that eventually were incorporated at Pergamum during the Greek period and eventually to Rome during the Roman period. As was common to all seven cities, numerous pagan statues, shrines, and temples were built in homage to the Roman Imperial Cult. It is also depicted on their coinage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/b43ad60e966f33f3df7bb0b269ade942.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt; As discussed previously, this put the gentile believers in a difficult position. Emperor worship was compulsory unless you were Jewish. Although not explicitly stated, we can speculate that many in Pergamum went through the motions of the emperor worship procedures (compared to Smyrna, where they did not). Jewish believers and nonbelievers were still in an uncomfortable position, of course. The Torah prohibits graven images, such as the one on this coin and the many statutes erected around the town. Many probably simply got used to it; in other words, they compromised. The genuinely devout would have continued to be bothered by it. As we discussed in the Smyrna lesson, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be beaten to feel beaten down. DeSilva notes, &amp;ldquo;Antagonism towards the Christian movement appears to have been particularly high (in Pergamum), resulting in the murder (whether as a result of official proceedings or back-alley action) of a Christian named Antipas.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This was life for the believers in the Roman empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener also notes that local rulers were first worshipped and revered in Pergamum, and emperor worship is reflected on coins. &amp;ldquo;Pergamum was one of the first cities of Asia to build a temple to a Roman emperor, making it a center of the cult.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; DeSilva notes that &amp;ldquo;the temple of Roma and Augustus in Pergamum is a manifestation of the cult of the beast and its image.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In any case, we can infer that Pergamum was exceedingly wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;altar-to-zeus&#34;&gt;Altar to Zeus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/f7f18007082f93aa77df3052250281ce.png&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeus (or Jupiter to the Romans) is believed to be the chief of the Greek gods. In Pergamum, there was a massive temple to Zeus. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In a 1st century Jewish mindset, he would be the chief of the false gods, making him equivalent to Satan. Where there is a temple to a god is where his throne is. This leads many to conclude Zeus&amp;rsquo; temple is &amp;ldquo;where Satan has his throne.&amp;rdquo; The altar is in Berlin today; although it is commonly believed that Hitler had it moved, Bolen notes that it was moved in the 19th century.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Today all that remains in Pergamum are stairs and the altar&amp;rsquo;s foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;aesculapius&#34;&gt;Aesculapius&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/10bf26ff4badeff9e089ff42369ea9c7.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aesculapius was a god who had healing and resurrection powers by using the blood of Medusa. The latter is how he came to be associated with snakes. Note the counterfeit themes of healing, resurrection, and blood. Aesculapius is almost always portrayed with a snake, Propylon, who gave him healing powers.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  As an aside, Asclepius had two noteworthy daughters, Hygia and Panacea, where we get our words hygiene and panacea today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/68649e45907aec31b0f65ded85087eef.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/c29803cf3643e7952d344b123c2b7d42.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;  &gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also see the serpent imagery proudly displayed on this coin from Pergamum. As we&amp;rsquo;ve said before, we need to put ourselves in the shoes of those believers living in that time and realize how difficult life was to be a pure and undefiled believer in Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early medicine was directly associated with serpent worship. It was more superstition than science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed is the serpent symbolism, such as the modern logo of the American Medical Association, the professional organization for physicians in the United States. Many health related agencies use the serpent on a pole symbolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;The original serpent on a pole: Numbers 21&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/9030f3e7d0839a48c6007c8b1f3eed4d.jpg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;The serpent on a pole is likely a corruption of Numbers 21. When the Israelites in the wilderness grumbled against God and Moses, they had a lack of faith and believed they were led out in the wilderness to die. We may not utter those words, but how often is our attitude precisely like this. God wants to build us, and that can be painful at times. He&amp;rsquo;s using that two-edged sword to excise tumors in our lives. In Israel&amp;rsquo;s case, the Lord sent fiery serpents, perhaps cobras, as a curse, and many died. Those who survived prayed for relief. Here God tells Moses to do something that admittedly is very odd. Num 21:8 And the LORD said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent (out of bronze) and set it on a pole, and everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.” Moses made the serpent out of brass. In Hebrew, there is a deliberate play on words as snake/serpent and brass are linguistically connected נְחַ֣שׁ נְחֹ֔שֶׁת. Brass is a symbol of judgment, and in this case, the snakes were a judgment. IN the Garden, the snake brought judgment. Interestingly, 700 or 800 years later, this pole is still around and yet has become an item of idolatry (idolatry is the very thing Jesus has most against the assembly at Pergamum). During his religious reforms, Judean King Hezekiah, one of the good kings who &amp;ldquo;did what was right in the eyes of the LORD…smashed the bronze serpent Moses had made, for until those days the people of Israel had made offerings to it (it was called Nehushtan).&amp;rdquo; (2 Kings 18:4) Walton notes, &amp;ldquo;Nehushtan appears to have been diety of healing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is not too much of a stretch to see that what started as a legitimate symbol of God&amp;rsquo;s healing became paganized into Asclepius.&lt;/p&gt;

Archeologists have identified around 400 of these, but the largest was in Pergamum. The Asclepion in Pergamum was a large complex with healing chambers, sacred pools for mud baths, a medical library (using the phrase loosely), and a 3500-seat theater. It was believed that a combination of Aesculapius worship, sedative or hallucinogenic drug use, and snakes (sometimes snake bites) would bring about healing. It was something like an entertainment center, late 60&amp;rsquo;s Haight-Ashbury district, hospital, a pagan temple, and spa rolled into one. Emperor Hadrian was once a patient at the Asclepium in Pergamum. Lancaster reports that patients were given a drug, then they would enter the complex by way of an 86-yard dark tunnel where they would hear voices (actually priests standing above the tunnel), then he or she would lie in a bed, and snakes would slither over the patient and speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aesclepium in Pergamum was the most famous, but there were other such centers throughout the Greco-Roman world; archeologists have identified 400 Aesclepia. Biblical scholars and archeologists believe there was such a place in Jerusalem, called the Pools of Bethesda. John 5 takes on an entirely new level of understanding once we realize this was not a place where an angel of the Lord stirred the waters.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It was a pagan and demonic healing center where Jesus proved Himself greater. See our video from &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/G6XOcfHcchQ&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gospel Backgrounds #11&lt;/a&gt; for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given Satan&amp;rsquo;s association with the serpent from Genesis 3, the Asclepion is another strong candidate for &amp;ldquo;Satan&amp;rsquo;s throne,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;new-testament-pergamum&#34;&gt;New Testament Pergamum&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation contains the only two mentions of Pergamum in the New Testament.  After the apostolic period, Bolen notes intense persecution of Christians broke out under the rule of Decius (249-251), but the Edict of Milan in 313 declared Christianity legal, and by 379, &amp;ldquo;it had become the state religion; pagan temples were converted into churches.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the present city of Bergama lies near ancient Pergamum. Bergama has a population of around 20,000, compared to ten times that many in Roman times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Pergamum, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the one who has the sharp double-edged sword:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 1:16 In his right hand, he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in full strength.  &lt;br&gt;Joh 1:17 For (just as) the law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.  &lt;br&gt;Isa 11:4 but with righteousness, he shall judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth; and he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked.  &lt;br&gt;Isa 49:2 He made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand he hid me; he made me a polished arrow; in his quiver, he hid me away.  &lt;br&gt;2 Th 2:8 And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming. &lt;br&gt; 2 Ti 3:16-17 All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, (17) that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pergamum&lt;/strong&gt; meaning: directly it means height or elevation, which given the geography fits. Indirectly, it could be related to marriage (monogamy, polygamy). In medical terms, &lt;em&gt;per&lt;/em&gt; usually means through (percutaneous, through the cutaneous layer of the skin; perforate is to tear or make a hole through). In this sense while &amp;ldquo;through marriage&amp;rdquo; Pergamum could connote a &amp;ldquo;strange or abnormal marriage&amp;rdquo;, one that is penetrated or perforated inappropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/7f2c14d943c86419e27335e4e929d7e5.png&#34; width=&#34;30%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;A literal &lt;strong&gt;sword&lt;/strong&gt; is a weapon that can be used either offensively or defensively. It protects, separates, and, if necessary, kills. In antiquity and today with Islam, the sword is synonymous with the power to execute judgment, specifically capital punishment.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Therefore, Jesus&amp;rsquo; selection of the sword image could be related to the event He&amp;rsquo;s about to recount regarding Antipas&amp;rsquo; capital punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The congregation in Pergamum was in a challenging location, where &lt;strong&gt;Satan dwells&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s no accident (and in the Bible, nothing is there by accident) that Jesus has the sharp two-edged sword. They are in a spiritual battle, and the weapons need to be sharpened for use. We are in spiritual warfare too, so this letter is for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that the sword is described as sharp. So it&amp;rsquo;s not just a double-edged sword; it&amp;rsquo;s a SHARP double-edged sword. If you were a surgeon, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a very good one if you operated with a dull scalpel. In the Bible, the sword is a well-established metaphor for the word of God. How sharp is your sword? When we read the letter to Ephesus, we looked at the armor of God passage in Ephesians 6. There is one crucial point to make, and it relates to having a sharp sword. The time to get fitted for the armor is before the battle. If you wait until you&amp;rsquo;re already in the middle of a fight, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to say it&amp;rsquo;s too late because better late than never; but doing it before the battle is the way to go. In the same way, you make sure your sword is sharpened before you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Christians believe that the double-edges refer to the Old and New Testaments, but we must remember that there was no New Testament in John&amp;rsquo;s day. The beginnings of a New Testament are still well over 100 years away. More precisely, it is the Law of Moses and the grace/Gospel of Jesus, as we see in John 1:17. Note that if your translation has a &amp;ldquo;but&amp;rdquo; after Moses, that word is not in the original, completely changing the meaning. Remove it from your thinking. Law, grace, and truth are not opposites. You can&amp;rsquo;t have grace and truth unless you have a standard of reference, which is the law. The opposite of law is lawlessness, as we see in 2 Thessalonians 2:8. The opposite of the Torah is to be without the Torah, i.e., without teaching the Scriptures. The opposite of grace is disgrace. As we see in Revelation 1:16 and 2:12, law and grace are two sides of the same sword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should always remember 2Ti 3:16-17: &amp;ldquo;All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, (17) that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luke 21:17 You will be hated by all for my name&amp;rsquo;s sake.  &lt;br&gt;Jude 1:4 For certain people have crept in unnoticed who long ago were designated for this condemnation, ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.  &lt;br&gt;2 Ti 2:12 if we endure, we will also reign with him; if we deny him, he also will deny us;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t know precisely what Jesus was referring to when He said &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Satan&amp;rsquo;s throne&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo; The worship of the Emperors, Zeus, and Aesculapius would each be viable candidates.  He could also have been referring to Pergamum in general, as a city that was the epicenter of false religion (second only to Rome in that regard).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;&amp;lsquo;The Unseen Realm&amp;rsquo;: Are Satan and the serpent one and the same?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Heiser&amp;rsquo;s book, The Unseen Realm, has a fascinating discussion on the distinction between the devil/serpent of Genesis 3 and &amp;ldquo;the Satan&amp;rdquo; of, say, Job 1. Heiser describes that in the earliest Jewish writings, &amp;ldquo;the Satan described in (Job 1) is not the devil. Rather he&amp;rsquo;s an anonymous prosecutor fulfilling a role in God&amp;rsquo;s council.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In other words, it appears the Satan&amp;rsquo;s (the accuser&amp;rsquo;s) role was to serve at God&amp;rsquo;s pleasure to test (in the sense of purifying) God&amp;rsquo;s people. Later, Jewish writings began to conflate the devil and the Satan. &amp;ldquo;The dark figure of Genesis 3 was eventually thought of as the &amp;lsquo;mother of all adversaries,&amp;rsquo; and so the label &lt;em&gt;satan&lt;/em&gt; got stuck to him. He deserves it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heiser&amp;rsquo;s book is a scholarly yet most readable examination of the supernatural realm, with which most Christians are not familiar. It fits with a study of Revelation, and I highly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people&amp;rsquo;s first instinct would be to get away from such a city. It&amp;rsquo;s natural to want to be safe and comfortable, but we as believers have a different calling. Jesus said He came to seek the lost, and His instructions to us are to make talmidim disciples from all nations. A modern example might be Las Vegas. Many believers say they have no desire to go there. Suppose the purpose is not to participate in the sinful entertainment economy; that&amp;rsquo;s fine and wise in many cases. But if we think that God doesn&amp;rsquo;t or can&amp;rsquo;t love the people in that city caught up in sin, we are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminded me of a story. I grew up in a suburb of Los Angeles, and in the mid-70s, a former Los Angeles Dodger named Maury Wills came to speak at my elementary school. He played shortstop. He said there were two kinds of ballplayers. Those who said, &amp;ldquo;please, I hope he doesn&amp;rsquo;t hit the ball to me,&amp;rdquo; and those who said, &amp;ldquo;hit the ball to me. Hit the ball to me.&amp;rdquo; What type of Christian are you? What type am I? It&amp;rsquo;s natural to want things to be safe and comfortable, but the Bible nowhere promises this. Some of us need to first get in the game. Then once we are there, we need to say, &amp;ldquo;God, hit the ball to me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holding on to His name&lt;/strong&gt; does not mean they merely claimed to be Christians. As we&amp;rsquo;ve studied, the meaning of an English word such as &amp;ldquo;name&amp;rdquo; might be abstract, and the underlying Hebrew thought generally implies action. The word for name means one&amp;rsquo;s character and reputation. If we hold fast to His name, we aren&amp;rsquo;t just paying lip service. We are positively representing Him by our conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t know who &lt;strong&gt;Antipas&lt;/strong&gt; was except to say that was a prevalent name. Herod Antipas was the Herod who beheaded John the Baptist (Mar 6:22), hunted Jesus during His earthly ministry (Luke 13:31), and mocked Jesus at one of His trials (Luke 23:11), so obviously, this is a different Antipas. Church tradition holds that John appointed Antipas as bishop over Pergamum and that he healed people and expelled demons. He was put to death because he threatened the Asclepius cultic and economic system. As he was dying, he reportedly said, &amp;ldquo;your faith in gods is a false one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The legend fits almost a little too perfectly with Pergamum, so we can&amp;rsquo;t discount the fact that some liberties might have been taken with the historical Antipas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(14) Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: you have some people who hold to the teaching of Bil`am, who taught Balak to set a trap for the people of Isra&amp;rsquo;el, so that they would eat food that had been sacrificed to idols and commit sexual sin. (15) Likewise, you too have people who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Numbers 22-25, 31 &lt;br&gt;Joshua 13:22 Balaam also, the son of Beor, the one who practiced divination, was killed with the sword by the people of Israel &lt;br&gt;2 Pe 2:15 Forsaking the right way, they have gone astray. They have followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved gain from wrongdoing,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This letter gets our attention since Smyrna had zero things against and Ephesus had only one. When Jesus says, &amp;ldquo;I have &lt;strong&gt;a few things&lt;/strong&gt; against you,&amp;rdquo; it&amp;rsquo;s time to buckle up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;sexual immorality&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; as used in Rev 2:14 is most certainly literal, the Old Testament frequently sees idolatry as spiritual infidelity against God. It&amp;rsquo;s beyond our scope to give this the treatment it deserves, but many scholars see the Torah as a contact, specifically a marriage contract between God and His people (just as believers in Messiah are referred to as His Bride). Breaking that contract to follow another god is the same as breaking one&amp;rsquo;s wedding vows by sexual sin. Likely both are in view here at Pergamum. People claiming to be believers and followers of Jesus, his Bride, are &amp;ldquo;whoring&amp;rdquo; after the Roman gods, if for no other reason than to fit in with the rest of the society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the many cryptic references in these letters (and we assume they were not cryptic to the original audience), we know precisely what Jesus meant when He referred to &lt;strong&gt;Balaam and Balak&lt;/strong&gt;. The story spans Numbers 22-25, with a post-script in Numbers 31. Interestingly, this story immediately follows the episode of the bronze serpent (Num 21:4-9). Perhaps Jesus&amp;rsquo; audience (at least the Jewish members) would have realized the connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, Balak was the king of the Moabites. Ammon and Moab were sons of Lot via incestual relations with his daughters. In other words, the Moabites were related to the grand-nephew of Abraham, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly get off to a stellar beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The territorial land of Moab is in the southern section of modern Jordan today. The Moabites and Israelites became foes when Israel asked to pass through Moab on their way to the Promised Land but were refused (a shocking violation of the usually obligatory middle eastern hospitality). In the photo, the Israelites were asking to pass through the land where the &amp;ldquo;Moab&amp;rdquo; label is. Balak feared a military incursion, but the Israelites genuinely only needed to use the well-traveled Kings Highway to reach a point to cross the Jordan and enter their land. Balak hired a well-known prophet named Balaam to curse the Israelites. He would be reimbursed for his troubles. Balaam, who appears to have had some sort of genuine line of communication with Adonai, the God of the Israelites, agreed, leading to his description as a &amp;ldquo;prophet for hire&amp;rdquo; or, as I like to say, &amp;ldquo;the for-profit prophet.&amp;rdquo; Repeatedly, as Balaam went to curse Israel, God intervened, and he was unable. This led Balak to think that maybe Balaam had been outbid by the Israelites to bless instead of curse. Balak offered an even sweeter compensation package, to which Balaam naturally agreed. This led to a literal &amp;ldquo;come to Jesus&amp;rdquo; meeting between Balaam, and the angel of the LORD, whom most Christians would say is a pre-incarnate appearance of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balaam&amp;rsquo;s donkey sees Jesus before Balaam does in a rather humorous episode. When the donkey stopped, Balaam kicked her and struck her. Then the donkey said, &amp;lsquo;what have I done to you that you have struck me these three times?&amp;rsquo; Not impressed that his donkey talked, he answered &amp;lsquo;because you have made a fool of me. I wish I had a sword in my hand, then I would kill you.&amp;rsquo; … Then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the lord with His drawn sword.&amp;quot; Despite explaining to Balak the situation, Balaam did what a lot of us do when we get an answer we don&amp;rsquo;t like from God. We keep asking. In the end, Balaam could do none other than blessing Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 24 ends with Balaam and Balak going their separate ways and a casual reading might lead us to believe that all of these shenanigans came to nothing. Chapter 25 begins with a seemingly unrelated episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Num 25:1-3 While Israel lived in Shittim, the people began to whore with the daughters of Moab. (2) These invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods. (3) So Israel yoked himself to Baal of Peor. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the episode Jesus references in Revelation 2:14 about eating food sacrificed to idols and practicing sexual immorality. As an aside, Numbers 25:4 and following describes what is known as the &amp;ldquo;zeal of Phinehas&amp;rdquo; who slew both the men of Israel and the Moabite women, thus stopping the plague that ultimately killed 24,000. This was no minor plague. This is where the term Zealots originated from as used in the New Testament. The Zealots were a group that agitated for the violent overthrow of Rome. Despite Jesus not aligning with this philosophy, many zealots aligned with Jesus thinking He might be a means to the end they wanted to achieve. Because of the number of people following Jesus, the Jewish and Roman authorities constantly feared a riot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then don&amp;rsquo;t read anything about Balaam until he is killed in a raid in Numbers 31:8. The Holy Spirit wanted us to know that Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba were killed, &amp;ldquo;and they also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword.&amp;rdquo; There is an exciting sword theme running through this section, isn&amp;rsquo;t there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t find out until Numbers 31:16 connects-the-dots for us that the episode in chapter 25 happened because Balaam told Balak how he could bring a curse upon Israel. If Moab made their pretty young ladies available to the Israelite men, the men wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to resist. Note that God didn&amp;rsquo;t directly curse the Moabites. After all, we could say they were acting like Moabites (which is why the book of Ruth the Moabitess is so astounding and a powerful picture of a gentile coming to faith in Israel&amp;rsquo;s God). God cursed the Israelites who were not acting the way Israelites should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what excuses they made. &amp;ldquo;just this once.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;no one will know.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Everybody&amp;rsquo;s doing it.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;God wants me to be happy.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I have freedom in Christ.&amp;rdquo; Ok maybe the Israelites didn&amp;rsquo;t use that last one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that is the story of Balaam and Balak. What Satan can&amp;rsquo;t accomplish externally through force and persecution, he can often achieve from within by leveraging the corruptible natures of the believers. If we are in Christ we are saved from the penalty of sin but, as long as we are alive on this earth and until He comes again, we must continually work to deal with the power of sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2nd Peter 2:15 tells us those who follow the way of Balaam love gain from wrongdoing. All of 2nd Peter chapter 2 is worth reading for additional context, but key verses would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Pe 2:1-3 But false prophets also arose among the people, &lt;strong&gt;just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them&lt;/strong&gt;, bringing upon themselves swift destruction. (2) And many will follow their sensuality, and the way of truth will be blasphemed because of them. (3) And in their greed, they will exploit you with false words. Their condemnation from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Pe 2:12-15 But these, like irrational animals, creatures of instinct, born to be caught and destroyed, blaspheming about matters of which they are ignorant, will also be destroyed in their destruction, (13) suffering wrong as the wage for their wrongdoing. They count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions, while they feast with you. (14) They have eyes full of adultery, insatiable for sin. They entice unsteady souls. They have hearts trained in greed. Accursed children! (15) Forsaking the right way, they have gone astray. &lt;strong&gt;They have followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved gain from wrongdoing&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Pe 2:19-21 They promise them freedom, but they are slaves of corruption. For whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved. (20) For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and &lt;strong&gt;overcome&lt;/strong&gt;, the last state has become worse for them than the first. (21) For &lt;strong&gt;it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are contemptuous words to be sure. If we don&amp;rsquo;t read carefully, it would be easy to think that verses 12-15 are talking about pagans.  However, verses 1 and 21 are clear. These people are &lt;strong&gt;PROFESSING BELIEVERS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These false teachers had slipped into the congregation(s) at Pergamum. Keener believes these false teachers &amp;ldquo;may be advocating compromise with the imperial cult&amp;hellip;and may have used their prophecies to commend themselves to elements of pagan universalism.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve already examined the Nicolaitans in the letter to Ephesus, but note Ephesus resisted while Pergamum tolerated. Jesus seems to equate whatever the Nicolaitans were doing with the sexual and dietary sins in the Balaam incident, which is why I believe the Nicholas (unrestrained sexual perversion no matter what the Bible says) or &amp;ldquo;Nochal&amp;rdquo; (we will eat all no matter what the Bible says), theories fit the context better &amp;ldquo;conquerors of the laity&amp;rdquo; theory for who the Nicolaitans were. To put it another way, the Nicolaitans used the same strategy to undermine the congregation at Pergamum that Balaam and Balak used to undermine Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the people to whom Jesus is directing verse 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-216-repent&#34;&gt;Rev 2:16 &amp;ldquo;Repent!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Revelation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(16) Therefore, turn from these sins. Otherwise, I will come to you very soon and make war against them with the sword of my mouth.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rev 19:15 And out of his mouth comes to a sharp sword with which to strike down nations—&amp;ldquo;He will rule them with a staff of iron.&amp;rdquo; It is he who treads the winepress from which flows the wine of the furious rage of Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies.  &lt;br&gt;Rev 19:21 The rest were killed with the sword that goes out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the Balaam references, the sword imagery is conspicuous (Num 22:23, 29, 31; 31:8, Joshua 13:22). In effect, Jesus is saying if the people are going to act like Balaam, they will meet with a similar ending. Jesus isn&amp;rsquo;t wielding a literal sword; He doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to. His literal words are plenty powerful. Also, there is the just punishment recorded in the Torah for those who follow in the way and the teaching of Balaam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we are starting to see the connection Jesus is building. When we take a more expansive view, the two judgments for the unrepentant (Ephesus and Pergamum) would seem to involve a forfeiture of eternal life. At Ephesus, Jesus said He would remove the menorah from its place. Since Jesus is in the midst of the menorah, he is talking about removing the unrepentant from His presence. Here, the unrepentant will receive the sword of judgment, which we can see fulfilled in Revelation 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the same lines, all the promises to the overcomers involve gaining eternal life. Ephesus would get to eat from the Tree of Life, Smyrna will be exempted from the second death, and below, Pergamum will eat of the &amp;ldquo;hidden manna.&amp;rdquo; We&amp;rsquo;ll describe the connection to eternal life in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the overcomers get to do these things, then we can logically assume that non-overcomers, the unsaved, do NOT get to do these things. Also, the Tree of Life was literal. The manna in the wilderness was literal food. We can assume the second death is also literal. In other words, Jesus is not merely speaking symbolically that believers will go to heaven and the unbelievers will go to hell. There is much more involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pergamum-gets-no-secondary-encouragement&#34;&gt;Pergamum gets no secondary encouragement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical letter has a judgment sandwiched between two separate words of praise and encouragement; a &amp;ldquo;praise sandwich&amp;rdquo; if you will.  Right here is the point where we would expect the secondary encouragement (e.g., &amp;ldquo;but you have those &lt;who are doing something good&gt;&amp;rdquo;).  This is absent for Pergamum.   Pergamum&amp;rsquo;s letter is open-faced, not a sandwich. An open faced sandwich is good if you&amp;rsquo;re trying to cut back on carbs, but not so good if you want to do good deeds that please your Master. Pergamum receives a praise and a judgment, but no closing secondary praise or encouragement. SO we get a clue that while the situation is not quite as dire as with Sardis and Laodicea, who get no praise, we do get the sense that something is fundamentally wrong with Pergamum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(17) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities. To him winning the victory, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give him a white stone, on which is written a new name that nobody knows except the one receiving it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Exo 16:31-35 Now the house of Israel called its name manna. It was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. (32) Moses said, “This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations, so that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’” (33) And Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar, and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the LORD to be kept throughout your generations.” (34) As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the testimony to be kept. (35) The people of Israel ate the manna forty years, till they came to a habitable land. They ate the manna till they came to the border of the land of Canaan. &lt;br&gt;Joh 6:31 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the scholars I read describe some plausible conjectures but ultimately are forced to throw up their hands. There is a Jewish tradition regarding the hidden manna that both Keener and Lancaster note in their comments. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at each of these three elements as best we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;hidden-manna&#34;&gt;Hidden manna&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, I would refer anyone interested in unpacking this to review Craig Keener&amp;rsquo;s notes in the IVP Bible Background Commentary, New Testament, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bethimmanuel.org/audio/hidden-manna-and-white-stone&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Daniel Lancaster&amp;rsquo;s audio teaching&lt;/a&gt;. In summary, when God provided manna from heaven for the people to eat during the wilderness wanderings, he also instructed Aaron to take an omer of the manna (about two quarts) and keep it before Adonai. See Ex 16:31-36. After the Ark of the covenant was built, it was placed inside, with Aaron&amp;rsquo;s rod that budded in front of Pharoah and the copy of the 10 Commandments. As has been popularized by a very famous movie, the Ark seemingly vanished without a trace around the Babylonian conquest of 586 BCE. This has led to several speculations and traditions about where the ark and its contents might be. A Jewish tradition holds that Elijah will present the jar of the hidden manna to the Messiah at the start of the millennial kingdom.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Keener doesn&amp;rsquo;t go to this detail, but he notes that the pot of hidden manna will &amp;ldquo;be restored at the end time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Lancaster is confident that Jesus is confirming this legend. In his view, it would have been impossible for Jesus&amp;rsquo; first-century audience to have interpreted the phrase &amp;ldquo;hidden manna&amp;rdquo; as anything other than this legend.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the connection to the millennial kingdom, it is another way of saying those who get to partake of the hidden manna will receive eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is Jesus going to feed everyone from just one omer of manna? Apparently, another feeding miracle is still to come; only this time, it will hopefully be much more than 5000! Lastly, don&amp;rsquo;t miss the fact that the letters to Ephesus and Pergamum both mention the Nicolaitans, and both mention that the overcomers would eat clean and proper food. This may or may not be significant, but I think it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;white-stone&#34;&gt;White stone&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/cf5f12d5721fb19bdee09cb7ce67f7ae.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photo is a white stone with an inscription. It&amp;rsquo;s located in Pergamum, which calls to mind Revelation 2:17&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most commentators believe this was some kind of judicial procedure where a white stone signifies one is innocent and a black stone means one is guilty. Others said it was a type of admission ticket. So here, Jesus is simultaneously proclaiming the overcomers as innocent, which grants them admittance to the Messianic Banquet. Lizorkin speculates that of the twelve stones on the High Priests robe, the white one represented the tribe of Zebulun. Zebulun&amp;rsquo;s tribal allotment was Galilee of the nations, leading to the famous passage in Isaiah 9:1-7 about a child being born and a son given.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So the secret white stone could be the Messiah himself. For sure, these speculations may fit varying degrees, but as we will see later in our study, just because something fits doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that&amp;rsquo;s what God was communicating. I like the way the Believer&amp;rsquo;s Bible Commentary concluded their discussion. After listing all of the usual theories, &amp;ldquo;it seems clear that it is a reward given by the Lord to the overcomer and expressing individual approval by Him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; That, my friends, is about all we can be sure of!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Civic pride and the Imperial Cult&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many visitors to Pergamum note the photo above and the inscription on a white stone. This recalls Jesus&amp;rsquo; words. This photo above is a dedication to the town&amp;rsquo;s ancient gymnasium honoring the facility&amp;rsquo;s director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We mentioned in the Ephesus lesson that Ephesus and Pergamum had a bit of a rivalry. I grew up in Los Angeles, so that I can compare it to the LA San Francisco rivalry. Maybe New York and Boston is another example. The Romans would award a neokoros, which essentially means &amp;ldquo;temple warden.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s sort of like being selected to host the Olympics today. It was an honor and a big deal for that city. We mentioned earlier that Pergamum was the first to be named neokoros for its consecration and worship of Augustus. Later Smyrna and Ephesus would also gain that title for their temples. deSilva notes that Ephesus began to flaunt its recent title, which upset Pergamum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inscription on this stone says Pergamum was the FIRST to be awarded neokoros. Then when Pergamum received the honor of the temple to Trajan (after Revelation was written), they paraded the title &amp;ldquo;twice awarded neokoros.&amp;rdquo; Then after Ephesus won a second neokoros, Pergamos was then &amp;ldquo;first to be twice awarded.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may seem like a silly and fun rivalry, but DeSilva notes it ran much deeper. This demonstrates &amp;ldquo;how strong were the connections between civic pride and support for the imperial cult…at the very time that Christian witness against the legitimacy of (the)cult and resistance to participation was becoming sharper.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;deSilva, “Pergamum,” 644–645.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-new-name-that-nobody-knows&#34;&gt;A new name that nobody knows&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster and other commentators pointed out that the &amp;ldquo;new name&amp;rdquo; is the more important of the two. When God changed a name in the Old Testament, it indicated His approval and acceptance, and a promise usually accompanied it. As we mentioned above, a term in Hebraic thought denotes one&amp;rsquo;s character and, in some respects, one&amp;rsquo;s destiny. Review Genesis 49 and Jacob&amp;rsquo;s prophecies to the 12 tribes. He frequently invokes a translation of the son&amp;rsquo;s name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, note that this is the third and final letter where the promise to the overcomer occurs after the &amp;ldquo;those who have ears&amp;rdquo; statement. For the last four letters, the order will be reversed. We can speculate, but we are not told why this is. The more important aspect is remembering the Hebrew meaning of shamah and hearing. It means not just listening (or reading) but understanding and obeying what Jesus has to say. In fact, it is through obedience that we become overcomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The believers in Pergamum didn&amp;rsquo;t directly deny their Lord, which is to their credit, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t do the opposite either. They worshipped other gods alongside the One True God. Lizorkin writes of Pergamum, &amp;ldquo;only one God can be worshipped and adored,&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:21&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or as Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;no one can serve two masters.&amp;rdquo; Just like the rich young ruler, we must make a choice. In our day, Satan likes to trick us, believers, into thinking that we aren&amp;rsquo;t worshipping whatever it is we actually are worshipping (the sports team, the car, the job, or the toys or websites that captivate our attention; or the doctors and the medicines that supposedly heal us and save us from sickness). After all, it&amp;rsquo;s not like we&amp;rsquo;re bowing down to them or holding them up in the air while praying to Baal, Aesculepius, or some other god. Keep in mind the thing we worship doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have to be sinful. In our economy, a job is necessary. But when one becomes married to their job, it becomes an idol. We need a car to get from place to place. But when we use a vehicle to communicate our status, it becomes a problem. There is nothing inherently wrong with money. Money is not the root of all evil. That is a misquote. The Bible says, &amp;ldquo;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.&amp;rdquo; Stiles notes, &amp;ldquo;today there is a false god for anything and everything, and they offer immediate satisfaction. But they are not the truth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:22&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In contrast, Jesus doesn&amp;rsquo;t always offer immediate satisfaction. He requires trust, faith, and obedience. With the constant references in these letters to our being rewarded in the afterlife, believers must be willing to exchange a comfortable, instant gratification life today for the promise of not just greater, but the most significant rewards later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this in mind, think about where you and I are worshiping other gods alongside God?. Where are you (and I) married to the world? These are questions each of us must wrestle with and ask God to expose any areas where we need correction. As we said in a previous lesson, ask God to audit the books of your life. Each letter ends with &amp;ldquo;he who has an ear let him hear….&amp;rdquo; These letters are written for us today to examine ourselves and correct where needed so we can walk in faithful obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;church-age-theory&#34;&gt;Church age theory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/8553f6efbb2e3162debd77254735c497.png&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of the church age theory see Pergamum as representative of the State church, married to the world&amp;rsquo;s system of idolatry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In history, this started in 311, with the &amp;ldquo;Edict of Toleration,&amp;rdquo; which decriminalized Christianity and ended the official Roman persecution. Later Constantine would officially recognize Christianity, with the emperor himself &amp;ldquo;converting&amp;rdquo; to Christianity and legalizing Christianity in 313 with the Edict of Milan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are right to question the genuineness of his conversion, with skeptics viewing it as a pragmatic move to unify the people. In 285, Emperor Diocletian believed the Roman empire was getting too large. Hence, he not only divided it between east and west, each region would also have co-regents to help with administrative tasks. The senior administrator held Augustus&amp;rsquo;s title, while the junior administrator was titled, Caesar. There were four emperors, called a Tetrarchy. As Cargill rhetorically asked his class, &amp;ldquo;how many of you think this is going to work well?&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:23&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:23&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s like a family arrangement that starts as a good idea. When someone dies, and there are issues of succession and inheritance (and ego), it turns into a mess. This is exactly what happened. Constantine was the son of Constantius, who was the Caesar of the western half. He wanted it all and ultimately went to war with Maxentius, his counterpart in the East. Missler writes, &amp;ldquo;in 312 A.D: Constantine set out to defeat the forces of Maxentius, his rival, for supreme power in the empire. It is said that on the next day he saw a shining cross (or a &amp;ldquo;chi-rho&amp;rdquo;) in the sky with an inscription above it: &lt;em&gt;in hoc signo vinces:&lt;/em&gt; “In this sign, thou shalt conquer.” He defeated Maxentius at the Milvian bridge and immediately declared his conversion to Christianity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:24&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:24&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus&amp;rsquo; pacifist message of &amp;ldquo;turn the other cheek&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;My kingdom is not of this earth&amp;rdquo; was now replaced by a conquering Christian army who will now maim and kill in the name of Jesus. Keep this in mind when we get to the parable of the Mustard seed becoming something it was never intended to be in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, what was once a wholly Jewish faith, first called &amp;ldquo;the way&amp;rdquo; (דֶרֶך in Hebrew) is now being infiltrated by Greco-Roman philosophy to the point where it was now not only unrecognizable and incompatible with the Judaism Jesus taught, but many different gentile Christian splinter groups formed that were largely incompatible with each other. For example, groups debated the nature of Jesus and His relationship to the father. Some held he was a spirit being only (which has its roots in Gnosticism). Others held He was fully man and was only later adopted by God. Nearly everyone didn&amp;rsquo;t like the fact that He was Jewish. We can imagine the debate and infighting. This was often along geographic lines between those in the eastern and western parts of the empire, and these divisions are still around today. Constantine, pragmatically, saw an opportunity to unify the empire by bringing all these groups together to define Christian orthodoxy. In 324 was the Council of Nicaea, which resulted in the Nicene Creed and the doctrine of the Trinity. We can argue that the Creed is a good thing, but we can&amp;rsquo;t discount the fallout. Those who didn&amp;rsquo;t believe exactly the way the Council decided were now no longer Christians. This included Jewish believers. They were heretics, and heretics are burned at the stake. Ironically today, we have just as many if not more divisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Missler says, &amp;ldquo;The underground Christians exchanged the rags of oppression for the silks of the court.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:25&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:25&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few decades later, Theodosius made Christianity the official state religion of the Roman Empire. It was now not only the &amp;ldquo;in thing&amp;rdquo; to be a Christian, it was required. This led to many otherwise unregenerate people getting baptized. On that note, infant baptism was instituted, and now one was a Christian from birth no matter how they lived. Christianity didn&amp;rsquo;t immediately replace the Roman Imperial cult but existed alongside it. So the pagan practices of eating food sacrificed to idols and sexual immorality co-existed along with Christian traditions. Think of the pagan temple as a corner convenience store that now has a sign &amp;ldquo;under new management.&amp;rdquo; There may be some cosmetic changes, but it&amp;rsquo;s still the same convenience store. Temples were now Christian churches, and the pagan priests were now &amp;ldquo;Christian&amp;rdquo; priests. Pagan festivals such as spring fertility and winter solstice (longest night) were morphed into Easter and Christmas. As Missler says, &amp;ldquo;The underground Christians exchanged the rags of oppression for the silks of the court.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:25&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:25&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might be surprised how many practices from this time are still around today. Interestingly, it was the Jewish Christians who spoke out against this. For this, they now became the persecuted ones. Saturday worship was forbidden; Resurrection Sunday, instead of being the Jewish feast of Firstfruits, was intentionally disassociated from Passover (which remains today). Eating ham on Easter Sunday was instituted to isolate Jewish believers further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler points out that during this period is when symbolic and allegoric interpretations of scripture came to the forefront. In some respects, this might make sense. Jerusalem has been destroyed, which was predicted by Jesus, who often said that His kingdom was not of this world. There was also an ulterior motive by those in charge. In other words, the world&amp;rsquo;s corrupt rulers couldn&amp;rsquo;t edit out the part of the Bible that said Jesus is coming back to rid the world of its corrupt rulers. This was when the amillennial interpretation of the end times was popularized. Jesus is not coming again physically; He will rule in our hearts. This is a remnant of Gnostic philosophy that held that the physical is bad—only the spiritual matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another significant difference between the amillennial and those who hold a millennial worldview is the mission and destiny of the church. Amillennialists believe the church will grow and grow by political might to become an unstoppable force for good. Things will get better and better until, eventually, we will achieve Eden once again. The millennial kingdom is just another way of saying the church. Those who believe in a literal millennial kingdom would read the Bible that Satan oversees this world. The church is here to spread the Gospel, make disciples, and be a light in a dark world. Ultimately the world goes from bad to worse until Jesus intervenes. One group says it gets better and better, and the other group says it goes from bad to worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cargill sums up this period by saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Constantine is responsible for much of what we know as modern Christianity, for better and for worse.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:26&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:26&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;parables-pergamum--mustard-seed-mat-1331-32&#34;&gt;Parables: Pergamum = Mustard Seed (Mat 13:31-32)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
Mat 13:31 Yeshua put before them another parable. &#34;The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed which a man takes and sows in his field.
&lt;br&gt;Mat 13:32 It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it grows up, it is more significant than any garden plant and becomes a tree, so that the birds flying about come and nest in its branches.&#34;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garden plant:
:What the ecclesia should be according to Jesus. Typically, a mustard plant is a bush only a few feet high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tree:
:Many Christians see this as the church as growing and growing in greatness. In the context of something that should only be the size of a garden plant, having this grow into a tree represents a monstrosity. The thing has grown into something it was never intended to become. A compromised and carnal church that tolerates pagan practices of idolatry and sexual immorality and has made Christianity something Jesus never taught or intended it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birds of the air:
:Ministers of Satan (Matthew 13:19). The &amp;ldquo;birds of the air&amp;rdquo; from the first parable are ministers of Satan; it would be most unusual if Jesus changed the symbolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nest in its branches:
:The ministers of Satan set up shop, became this church&amp;rsquo;s leaders, and led the people astray just like Balaam/Balak did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning
:The suggestion is that what started small and was supposed to be a plant has become a monstrosity. It has become something it was never intended to be. It is so large that ministers can not just land but make nests, i.e., make a home, in its branches.
:Jesus said to carry a weapon for defense only, and even this was unusual. When He was arrested, He told the disciples to put their swords down. For all intents and purposes, Jesus&amp;rsquo; earthly ministry was a model of pacifism.
:Now with the advent of Constantine, we see the church as a conqueror, both politically and militarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;paul-pergamumcorinthians&#34;&gt;Paul: Pergamum=Corinthians&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler sees the Pauline tie-in for Pergamum as the letters to the Corinthians.  1st Corinthians in particular deals with the carnal church, as exemplified by 1 Cor 5:1.  Below are a few verses to illustrate similar issues happening in both Corinth and Pergamum.  We recommend a thorough study of 1/2 Corinthians in conjunction with our study of Pergamum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Co 2:12 Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Co 3:1-3 But I, brothers, could not address you as spiritual people, but as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ. (2) I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not ready for it. And even now you are not yet ready, (3) for you are still of the flesh. For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh and behaving only in a human way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Co 3:4 For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not being merely human? (&lt;em&gt;Greek culture divinized human heroes into gods.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Co 3:16-17 Do you not know that you are God&amp;rsquo;s temple and that God&amp;rsquo;s Spirit dwells in you? (17) If anyone destroys God&amp;rsquo;s temple, God will destroy him. For God&amp;rsquo;s temple is holy, and you are that temple. (&lt;em&gt;This correlates to the dietary and fleshly fornication happening at Pergamum.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1Co 4:2 Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1Co 4:5 Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive his commendation from God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1Co 5:1 It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, for a man has his father&amp;rsquo;s wife. (&lt;em&gt;Chapter 5 is all about sexual immorality.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1Co 5:11 But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler—not even to eat with such a one. (&lt;em&gt;Paul sounds awfully judgmental here.  Are we sure the Paul of the New Testament is the same Paul we have been taught?&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1Co 6:12-13 “All things are lawful for me,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful for me,” but I will not be dominated by anything. 13 “Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food”—and God will destroy both one and the other. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. (&lt;em&gt;The ESV does an excellent job of setting off the quotes. Paul is not saying these directly. He is quoting the arguments of his opponents. Read this carefully. Just as Paul is not saying sexual fornication is lawful (God forbid!), he neither is saying all food is OK. Could &amp;ldquo;we eat all because all things are permissible&amp;rdquo; be a teaching of the Nicolaitans we have all fallen for? Asking for a friend!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

We can also see the serpent imagery proudly displayed on this coin from Pergamum. As we&amp;rsquo;ve said before, we need to put ourselves in the shoes of those believers living in that time and realize how difficult life was to be a pure and undefiled believer in Yeshua.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In THE FIRST SIGN, we join Yeshua and His handful of followers in the Jordan River Valley near Jericho. We follow them north along the eastern side and pick up more disciples on Lake Galilee’s north shore in Bethsaida and Capernaum. A fishing boat takes us across the lake to Magdala.  From there, it’s a day’s walk to Cana of Galilee on the northern slopes of the Nazareth ridge, where Yeshua and His first followers attend a wedding. From there, we follow them back to Capernaum on the north shore of Lake Galilee, where they join a pilgrimage making their way down the Jordan Valley, following its eastern bank, before crossing near Jericho and ascending to Jerusalem for the Festival of Passover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-gospel-of-john-as-a-legal-document&#34;&gt;The Gospel of John as a legal document&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 He came as a &lt;strong&gt;witness&lt;/strong&gt;, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 He was not the light, but came to bear &lt;strong&gt;witness&lt;/strong&gt; about the light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 Johnn bore &lt;strong&gt;witness&lt;/strong&gt; about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19 And this is the &lt;strong&gt;testimony&lt;/strong&gt; of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 He &lt;strong&gt;confessed&lt;/strong&gt;, and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21 And they &lt;strong&gt;asked&lt;/strong&gt; him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22 So they said to him, “Who are you? &lt;strong&gt;We need to give an answer&lt;/strong&gt; to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;31 I myself did not know him, but for this purpose I came baptizing with water, &lt;strong&gt;that he might be revealed&lt;/strong&gt; to Israel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;32 And John bore &lt;strong&gt;witness&lt;/strong&gt;: “I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;34 And I have seen and have borne &lt;strong&gt;witness&lt;/strong&gt; that this is the Son of God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;who-were-the-ioudaioi&#34;&gt;Who were the &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.875in&#34; alt=&#34;C:\PLBLsr\apr4\Priestly blessing during Sukkot at Western Wall, tb092302017.jpg&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The translation of Ioudaioi always and only as “Jews” sends the reader in the opposite direction from what the author intended.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will develop this in later lessons but John the Gospel Writer, is very loose with his terminology. &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt;, which is the word John uses that is typically translated as “the Jews”, could mean anything from all Jews, to all believing Jews, to those in leadership of the Jewish religious establishment, to those geographically in or from Judea, some other subset&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if Ioudaioi refers to the religious establishment, John may be indenting for us to understand a specific subset of that. For example, Nicodemus was part of the &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; religious establishment, but we can be confident he is not part of the &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; with whom Jesus has any quarrel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an analogy we could use the term “Americans” The Americans won the gold medal in 1980. All 300 million of us? No. 20 hockey players representing the country. We could also say the Americans bombed Syria. Well that doesn’t all 300 million of us, but maybe a squadron of planes acting on order from one President. We also say today that “the House passed” some piece of legislation; all that could mean is at least 50% of those present+ 1, not all 435 House members acting in unison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many of us have learned to see the “Jews” especially as John uses it has a negative connotation to mean ALL Jews everywhere. The gospel of John has been used to support anti-Semitic behavior in the name of Jesus. This is incorrect and terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the 1st-century church consisted of &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt;, so it is an error to say that ALL &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; are guilty of rejecting and killing Jesus. There are believing &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; and rejecting &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt;. The temple establishment opposed to Jesus and ultimately those who arrested Him and had Him executed could have been a very small number. Perhaps less than 35 and maybe even less than 20: in other words, a very small group of hidden players acting behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, we need to make sure some latent anti-Semitic bias is removed from our reading. We need to work to discern the context and which Ioudaioi group John is referencing. If the context is negative, it is probably only the “deep state” fraction of the Temple establishment. This group was primarily Sadducees and Herodians with a small number of Pharisees along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we see the term “Ioudaioi” we will leave it untranslated to remind us that we need to be Bereans and explore the context in which John uses the term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;geographic-setting&#34;&gt;Geographic setting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:5.07014in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 1:28 tells us that “these things took place in Bethany across the Jordan where John was baptizing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good scholars dispute the location of “Bethany Beyond the Jordan”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Location of Jesus’ baptism is widely believed to be in the vicinity of Jericho, but this doesn’t mean that John the Baptist didn’t have different locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some, such as Schlaegel&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, hold that “Bethany” is actually north, in the Golan heights, which would account for disciples from Galilee being present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first four disciples known to be in Jesus’ company at this point are all from Bethsaida: Andrew, John (the unnamed disciple), Peter, and Philip.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter and Andrew would later move to Capernaum (Mark 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems logical that Peter, Andrew, James and John probably had a fishing cooperative, perhaps as a customs tax avoidance ploy as one boat would be registered in Capernaum (Herod Antipas’ region) and the other in Bethsaida (Herod Philip’s region).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion with Nathaniel possibly takes place at Bethsaida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will then make their way past Capernaum and Magdala, through the valley of the doves to Cana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the wedding miracle, they will return to Capernaum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-135-37&#34;&gt;John 1:35-37&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples, and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!” The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John would seem to place verse 35 as being the next afternoon following Jesus’ baptism where the spirit came down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might have been the next day but it didn’t need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John, and indeed the entire eastern mindset, is not as bound to a strict chronological record as we in the west have been brought up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust&#34;&gt;Walking in His dust&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like John, we should demonstrate humility and keep our eyes on God’s bigger picture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests but also to the interests of others. (Php 2:3-4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John 1:35, John the Baptist essentially refers two of his own disciples to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a teacher saying, “you should really go to the church down the street; that teacher is better than I am”!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, this is essentially what John the Baptist says to his former disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It speaks of John’s humility and that fact that his eyes were on God’s bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is how it should be with us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-138-39&#34;&gt;John 1:38-39&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, “What are you seeking?” And they said to him, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are you staying?” He said to them, “Come and you will see.” So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi here is transliterated Hebrew, a clue that Jesus and His talmidim spoke Hebrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other places, we will see Raboni, which is transliterated Aramaic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aramaic was the everyday language, while, we presume, Hebrew was used by the devout or in religious settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government language would have been Greek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They probably knew enough Greek to understand commercial transactions and to interact with Roman officials but it is highly doubtful they would have spoken Greek among themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Gospels, the word rabbi always speaks of Jesus (except in Matthew 23 where Jesus discusses the word itself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi in that day was more a term of respect and not, as it means today, a teacher with specific training and ordination who performs a specific role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What are you seeking?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus asks us the same question every day and every moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the disciples, we rarely answer the question directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We answer it by our choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where are you staying?” is an indirect way of asking to follow Jesus. They were answering His question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll unpack this in a later lesson, but it appears that “calling disciples” was a process, not a one-time event (think of the job application and interview process).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Rabbi and his perspective talmidim would take some time to get to know each other before agreeing to a multi-year commitment to one-another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This viewpoint untangles the various “callings” of the disciples that are recorded in the gospels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come and See” – head’s up; pay attention; follow me and learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They stayed with Him that day for it was about the 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; hour”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; hour is probably around 4pm (but it depends on the time of year; an hour wasn’t 60 minutes but 1/12 of daylight).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have suggested this was erev-shabbat, Friday afternoon, and the disciples were hoping to score an invitation to spend Shabbat with the Master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They didn’t just stay with Jesus that “night” but “that day,” meaning Friday night and all day Saturday, Shabbat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine spending Shabbat, a free day, with Jesus. No appointments, no phones or TV; talking Bible until late at night and then again the next morning perhaps after Shabbat prayers at the local synagogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing Jesus, I bet the conversation wasn’t limited to just Bible study; I imagine Jesus challenged them to be better. Perhaps the conversation was uncomfortable but never awkward, because it’s Jesus, our ultimate fiduciary; the One who would lay down His life for our best interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their lives would never be the same; they had found the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times have we breezed past a Bible verse like “and they stayed with Him that day” and not really thought about the implications?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-140-42&#34;&gt;John 1:40-42&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter&amp;rsquo;s brother. He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which means Christ). He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of John. You shall be called Cephas” (which means Peter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learn that one of the two talmidim who spent shabbat with Yeshua that day was Andrew. Scholars presume the other was John himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simon Peter, Andrew, James, and John probably grew up together and were likely in their mid-teens when they first met Jesus.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messiah means “anointed one”; it is a title, which in Greek is translated as Christ. Given the above discussion, his disciples would have referred to Jesus as the Mashiach, Messiah, not “Christ”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A subtle miracle here: Jesus and Peter had not met before, yet Jesus knows not only his first name but his family name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Jew would have recognized this as a sign of a prophet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cephas is a transliteration of Kefa, which means “rock”; rock in Greek is “petros”, which is how we get Peter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably a prophetic nickname about Peter’s future role in the early church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to imagine that it baffled Shimon at the time. “Why are you calling me that? We just met.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He brought him to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Augustine reportedly said, “John’s Gospel is deep enough for an elephant to swim yet shallow enough for a child not to drown.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He finds the messiah. He tells someone else he has found the messiah. He brings that someone else to the messiah. That someone else changed the world for Messiah. (I said that, not Augustine!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-143-44&#34;&gt;John 1:43-44&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, “Follow me.” Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A disciple of that day would be no more inclined to drop everything and follow a complete stranger than we would be today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus casting some sort of spell over his disciples to make them follow him blindly is entirely inconsistent with Jesus’ later passages to count the cost before answering the call to be His disciple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, even though the text doesn’t say this, it seems safe to infer that Philip and Jesus met previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I know I’m usually the first to point out “the text doesn’t say that,” but this is where we need to be Bereans and exclude potential conclusions that are contradicted elsewhere in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I wasn’t there and anything could have happened, on the surface, Philip following Jesus blindly is not consistent with other portions of scripture and is not consistent with what we think we know about 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century discipleship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beit Tzaidah – house of fish nets, or more simply “fish town”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By piecing together various biblical and historical clues, scholars speculate that John’s father Zebedee ran a sizable fishing business that included a partnership with Simon and Andrew as well as his own sons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars began excavating “et Tell” and many have concluded it is the ancient Bethsaida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem in identifying et-Tell with Bethsaida is its distance from the Sea of Galilee and its elevation above the ancient level of the lake&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been there and it’s not so much the distance from the lake as the fact that it is a much higher elevation, even if we account for potentially higher lake levels back in Jesus’ day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT excavators have concluded that the village contained a fisherman’s home based on their discovery of two types of lead net weights. One weight was round, of the so-called musket type, and the second was elongated, similar in shape to a crooked needle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentioned by name seven times in the Gospels, Bethsaida is one of the most frequently mentioned cities in the New Testament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-145-46&#34;&gt;John 1:45-46&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one of whom Moses spoke was the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deut 18:15-18 “The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your brothers—it is to him you shall listen— just as you desired of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly, when you said, ‘Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God or see this great fire any more, lest I die.’ And the LORD said to me, ‘They are right in what they have spoken. I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. And I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 3:22 Moses said, ‘The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers. You shall listen to him in whatever he tells you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though we don’t have legal terms, note how everyone is testifying, as Philip is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathaniel also testifies to Nazareth’s insignificance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more than 200 people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the Davidic connections and the fact that they were likely insular, it is possible outsiders viewed the people of Nazareth as somehow affiliated with the corrupt Jerusalem leadership, which would have been a negative for other Galileans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 21 tells us that Nathaniel is from Cana, which makes the statement about Nazareth that much more of a burn; Cana was as insignificant as Nazareth was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars believe Nathaniel and Bartholomew are one and the same.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-147-49&#34;&gt;John 1:47-49&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!” Nathanael said to him, “How do you know me?” Jesus answered him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Nathaniel’s skepticism, Jesus testifies in Nathaniel’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathaniel means “God gave,” or perhaps “God’s gift.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fig tree reference is apparently something only Nathaniel understood, though generally, the fig tree represents national Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symbolically, trees also represented knowledge and teachers often taught under trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might be a subtle pun: Israel/Jacob WAS a man of deceit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the vision of the angels ascending and descending which Jesus will reference in the next segment, Jacob was fleeing precisely because of his deceit of Esau.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lizorkin speculates that John’s intended audience might have been non-&lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; followers of Israel’s God; for example, Samaritans and Essenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so, Nathaniel’s pronouncement carries more significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is not just King of the &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt;, He is King of all Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-150-51&#34;&gt;John 1:50-51&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus answered him, “Because I said to you, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these.” And he said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly, truly is literally, “amen, amen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Heaven opened” indicates a major revelation from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This imagery evokes Jacob’s dream in Genesis 28:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And he dreamed, and behold, there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it! And behold, the LORD stood above it and said, “I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring.” (Gen 28:12-13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathaniel could have been reading Genesis 28 as he sat under the fig tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Samaritans have a specific attachment to Jacob and his favorite son, Joseph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John 4 we will be at Jacob’s well in Sychar, where the Samaritan woman will ask, “Are you greater than our father Jacob?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Jesus is seemingly anticipating that question and His answer is an emphatic “YES.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angels Jacob saw are not ascending and descending at a place in Samaria but upon Jesus Himself.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is the bridge/ladder between heaven and earth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-21-2&#34;&gt;John 2:1-2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.29514in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus also was invited to the wedding with his disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could refer to the third day of the week, Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, the third day of creation, was the day God said “It was good” twice (1:10 and 1:12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it is the “day of the double blessing,” some speculate that weddings were often held on Tuesdays, but this is disputed&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could also mean simply three days had elapsed since the discussion with Nathaniel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may also be literary bracketing; in John 2:19, Jesus says, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John is not necessarily chronological; while in our minds, John 2 occurs when Jesus is still relatively obscure, it is possible that wedding occurred after Jesus and his disciples had gained some regional notoriety and would be honored guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the map&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, you can see there are two contenders for Cana; one is off the beaten path, and the other happens to be on the main road from Nazareth to Tiberias (in other words, easier for the tour busses)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most scholars I’ve come across tend to side with the less accessible site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than officiating the wedding, Lancaster says that Jewish sages were invited to liven things up. The Talmud records the disciples of Hillel would sing before the bride and others added joy in various ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this tidbit fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there another wedding at some point in our future that Jesus will preside over where He will add joy? YES. You can read about it in Revelation 19 and all of the various wedding feast references in the New Testament – there are several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was about to inject more joy to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-23-5&#34;&gt;John 2:3-5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, “They have no wine.” And Jesus said to her, “Woman, what does this have to do with me? My hour has not yet come.” His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is today, if the host runs out of food or drink at a wedding it would be a major social faux-pas. 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Century Jewish wedding celebrations typically lasted for seven days and the host was responsible for providing this quantity of wine to his invited and uninvited guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commentator John Lightfoot believes that Mary might have had a formal role in the planning of the feast and was not merely being a busy body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Messianic Age is often depicted as a wedding banquet with free-flowing wine&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Holy One, blessed be He, will make a banquet for the righteous in the Garden of Eden…He will give them to drink wine preserved in its grapes since the six days of creation” (Numbers Rabbah 13:2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was Mary asking for the inauguration of the Messianic Age, and this is why Jesus replies as He does?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reply by Jesus to Mary’s request is not nearly as cold-sounding as it is in English and he is not disobeying the commandment to honor His mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can imagine Mary struggled to understand all of the various signs and wonders that she pondered in her heart since before Jesus was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From her response, “it is evident she was neither dissatisfied nor put off&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;” by Jesus’ remark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern speculates that Jesus was attempting to curtail Mary’s natural pride as the mother of the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus WOULD address the literal problem Mary brought to Him; but He would not do it in the public way that she hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say often that the people wanted a political messiah, not the suffering messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Mary didn’t want the political Messiah, then perhaps she wanted the happy, festive messiah, not the sword-piercing messiah (that prophecy in Luke 2:23 was probably still bothering her)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all need to be careful not to make God in our image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film series “The Chosen” takes the angle that Mary is not looking for personal glory but is merely trying to save her friend the public shame of running out of wine.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of Jesus reply being curt or disrespectful, the question is inquisitive, “why are you telling me this?” He then reiterates that it’s not the time for a public sign. To which Mary says “please…” – Jesus being Jesus figures out a way to honor His mother but have the sign kept quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I like about this portrayal is that it challenges the common narrative that Jesus was being rude. It gives us another way to look at the story – as long as it is still faithful to the Bible I think we should get comfortable with holding a couple of open options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting that many of the earliest Jewish commentaries weren’t commentaries as we think of them but paraphrases that creatively add in details that are omitted by the text. For example, the Jewish targum on Genesis 1:2 reads, “And the earth was vacancy and desolation, solitary of the sons of men, and void of every animal; and darkness was upon the face of the abyss, and the Spirit of mercies from before the Lord breathed upon the face of the waters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While always need to make sure any paraphrase lines up with scripture, God did give us the gift of imagination. There’s a time and a place for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase the exchange:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary: They have no more wine. I know you are the promised Messiah who is supposed to bring in the endless supply of wine. So bring some now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus: What can I do about it now? The Messianic Era when the supply of wine will be inexhaustible has not yet come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary (undaunted and in faith): Do whatever He tells you.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it wasn’t His time, the wedding feast at Cana, carries prophetic anticipation to the ultimate wedding feast, the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-26-8&#34;&gt;John 2:6-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there were six stone water jars there for the Ioudaioi’s rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water.” And they filled them up to the brim. And he said to them, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.” So they took it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; refers not to a people but to proper religious procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another suggestion that John is explaining the situation for non-Jewish readers, but ones who were loosely familiar with the procedure (as he doesn’t go into great detail about the reason for the purification rite).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though John may have been written to non-Jewish Israelites such as Samaritans, Jesus is clear that the Jewish method is the correct one (“Salvation is of the Jews.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do learn a couple of things about the Ioudaioi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ioudiaoi were not necessarily limited to the geographic terrotiry of Jerusalem or even Judea. This is in Cana in Galilee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every reference to Ioudaioi is referring to the temple establishment; as is the case here, it could be followers of the Jewish system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the audience were Jews as say in Matthew’s gospel, this qualifier would have been entirely unnecessary; John apparently expects his audience to be with purification rituals, but not necessarily JEWISH purification rituals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the size of the “jars” – they are almost as big as wine barrels – a significant quantity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John doesn’t tend to use numbers and details by accident so there is likely some significance to the six stone jars used for ceremonial washing – unfortunately, what that symbolism might have been is lost on us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first of seven major miracles in John’s gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John is testifying that he was an eyewitness that creation submitted to Jesus’ authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The master of the feast was responsible for the details of the banquet freeing up the host to attend to his guests and the festivities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He pronounced the blessings over the food and wine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, the first blessing over the first cup of wine was called the kos habesorah – cup of the good news.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The blessing was to declare and certify the bride’s purity.&lt;/strong&gt; Wow. Let that sink in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also was tasked with controlling the flow of food and drink; thus he would have been responsible for running out of wine prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-29-10&#34;&gt;John 2:9-10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the master of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew, the master of the feast called the bridegroom and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the poor wine. But you have kept the good wine until now.””&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the story is very familiar to us, this was a very private miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener notes that drunkenness to be part of the celebration at Cana is unlikely and the wine was often diluted 2:1 or 3:1.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-211-12&#34;&gt;John 2:11-12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory. And his disciples believed in him. After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother and his brothers and his disciples, and they stayed there for a few days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 11 is our memory verse for this lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John gives us the reason for the wine miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Stern says, the reason is “to anchor the trust of his new talmidim in the glory of God as manifested through Him.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson began with Andrew proclaiming Jesus as the one Moses spoke of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses’ first miracle was water to blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ first miracle was water to wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is unlikely to be a coincidence (the rabbis say “coincidence is not a kosher word.”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Genesis 9 - Human government</title>
      <link>https://talmidimway.com/commentary/genesis/gen1/gen09/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read/hear the portions&lt;/strong&gt;: Genesis 9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary: God reiterates His promise to never again to destroy all of mankind because of their deeds and sets the rainbow as a testimony of His new covenant with man. God also commands Noah regarding the sacredness of life: murder is deemed a capital offense, and while man is permitted to eat the meat of animals, he is forbidden to eat flesh or blood taken from a living animal. Noah plants a vineyard and becomes drunk on its produce. Two of Noah’s sons, Shem and Japheth, are blessed for covering up their father’s nakedness, while his third son, Ham, is punished for taking advantage of his debasement.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who adhere to dispensational theology see the third of seven dispensations beginning with Genesis 9. At the beginning of creation was the age of “Innocence.” After the fall and through the flood was the age of “Conscience.” After the flood and up until the promise to Abraham is the age of “Human Government.” An example of this is the institution of the death penalty in Genesis 9:5-6.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, we’re going to spend the bulk of our time looking at something called the Seven Noachide Laws that the Jewish sages derive from Genesis 9 and how those laws relate to the prohibitions given by the Apostles to the Gentile believers in Acts 15.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-91-6-god-commissions-noah&#34;&gt;Gen 9:1-6 God Commissions Noah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God reiterates the command given in Eden. In fact, God says “be fruitful and multiply” twice in this passage (v. 1 and v.7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to see that instead of filling the whole earth, humanity is going to gather at Bavel/Babylon&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, inviting yet another judgment from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every bird of the heavens, upon everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea. Into your hand, they are delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God recommissions Noah with Dominion; these words echo when God said “it was very good” in Genesis 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;birds - Dominion of the Air&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beasts - Dominion over the Land&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish - Dominion over the Water&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 2:7-8 You made him for a little while lower than the angels; you have crowned him with glory and honor, putting everything in subjection under his feet.” Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. And as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Timothy 4:1-3 Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons, through the insincerity of liars whose consciences are seared, who forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Peter is not talking about those who say we shouldn’t eat pork and shellfish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In God’s terminology, the flesh of unclean animals is not unclean food. It’s not food at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, pork and lobster are not foods that God created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul, who remained an observant jew until the end would not be advocating eating things God said not to eat and that he would not have eaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to think a better modern application would be those who say we need to stop eating beef (something first permitted in Genesis 9:4) and this whole push to eat fake meat that is laced with who knows what chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 But you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 15:19-20 Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God but should write to them to abstain from the things polluted by idols, and from sexual immorality, and from what has been strangled, and from blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton: “The draining of the blood before eating the meat was a way of returning the life force of the animal to the God who gave it life… (This ceremony) offers recognition that they are partaking of God’s bounty as His guests,…not unlike that of the blessing said before a meal in modern practice.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll talk much more about Acts 15 in our addendum to this lesson on the Noachide laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 And for your lifeblood I will require a reckoning: from every beast I will require it and from man. From his fellow man, I will require a reckoning for the life of man.
6 “Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed, for God made man in his own image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 26:52 And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear. Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recall from our chapter 1 discussion, that “Image” is likely not any specific human attribute such as reason or intellect – a human can lose these things through disease or accident and still be in the Image of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s best to think of “Image” as a status given by God to man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crude paraphrase might be “if you mess with one of my image bearers, you mess with Me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This institutes the practice of the avenger of blood – typically the victim’s next of kin was tasked with seeing justice was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standards for capital trials will be developed in Numbers 35 and Deuteronomy 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people ask what good putting to death a murderer achieves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fair response is there is no good that comes out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The victim’s life is not restored and now a second life is forfeited. It is a tragedy all around and it should not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT this is God’s standard for achieving justice in the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard puts a would-be murderer on notice this he will be directly responsible for two deaths: his victim’s life and his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-97-16-the-rainbow-promise&#34;&gt;Gen 9:7-16 The Rainbow Promise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 And you, be fruitful and multiply, increase greatly on the earth and multiply in it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 “Behold, I establish my covenant with you and your offspring after you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God covenants to find a different way to deal with man’s sin.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the livestock, and every beast of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark; it is for every beast of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 I have set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh. And the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of a local flood have a problem because there have been many local floods that have resulted in the loss of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has never been another worldwide flood that destroyed all life though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah 54:7-10 For a brief moment I deserted you, but with great compassion I will gather you. In overflowing anger for a moment, I hid my face from you, but with everlasting love I will have compassion on you,” says the LORD, your Redeemer. “This is like the days of Noah to me: as I swore that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you, and will not rebuke you. For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed, but my steadfast love shall not depart from you, and my covenant of peace shall not be removed,” says the LORD, who has compassion on you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ancient-covenants&#34;&gt;Ancient Covenants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to think of a covenant as a contract, which, in its simplest form it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a Biblical covenant is more like a Trust in that a covenant is always a promise made not only to the person, such as Noah or Abraham but to his heirs in perpetuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are all descendants of Noah; by virtue of verse 9, you and I are named in this trust covenant. That’s exciting!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covenants are Legally binding, like a contract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jos 9:19 But all the leaders said to all the congregation, “We have sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel, and now we may not touch them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we have a decision from the United States Supreme Court: United States vs. Throckmorton (1878) stated that “fraud vitiates the most solemn contracts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covenants are Intergenerational, like a trust&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exo 6:5 Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the people of Israel whom the Egyptians hold as slaves, and I have remembered my covenant (with Abraham)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covenants are usually conditional (both sides need to perform), but not always&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The covenants with Noah, Abraham and David are unilateral and unconditional – only God has to perform. There is nothing Noah, Abraham, or David could do to break the covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking a covenant has dire consequences&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A broken covenant requires atonement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of God’s covenants has a sign&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah-rainbow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham-circumcision&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses-the Sabbath&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David-House (Temple and Kingdom)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus/New-Holy Spirit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rainbow-as-a-sign-of-messiah&#34;&gt;Rainbow as a sign of Messiah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow teaches us about Messiah.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Token of peace between God and humanity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spans the distance between heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflects the radiance of the glory of God – Ezekiel 1:28 Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around. Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard the voice of one speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light from heaven interacts with moisture from the earth to produce a beautiful refraction and splendid display of divine glory. When the heavenly Word, the light of the world, interests an earthly man, it refracts into a beautiful demonstration of God’s glory on earth called Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a pun on the word bow, a sign of divine judgment. When we see the rainbow, we are worthy of the same fate as the flood generation, yet through a covenant of God, we are spared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-917-27-noahs-drunkenness&#34;&gt;Gen 9:17-27 Noah&amp;rsquo;s Drunkenness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17 God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.”
18 The sons of Noah who went forth from the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.)
19 These three were the sons of Noah, and from these, the people of the whole earth were dispersed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10 will give us the names of “these the people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, we almost expect the next verse after 9:19 to be Genesis 10:2 (as 10:1 is practically the same as 9:19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 Noah began to be a man of the soil, and he planted a vineyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Noah’s credit, chapter 8 tells us he built an altar and offered sacrifices first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that Noah rebuilt the same altar used by Adam after his banishment from the Garden and the same altar used by Cain and Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When Messiah comes, He will rebuild the holy Temple and reestablish the altar of the LORD. He will usher in an age during which vineyards will produce abundantly.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21 He drank the wine and became drunk and lay uncovered in his tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oldest known wine jar dates to the sixth millennium and was found in modern Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until now, Noah has been heroic in his righteousness. Like David, notice how the Bible is transparent regarding the shortcomings of otherwise great men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brothers outside.
23 Then Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it on both their shoulders, and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were turned backward, and they did not see their father&amp;rsquo;s nakedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even God’s righteous make mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are (at least) two mistakes happening here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah did something shameful in view of his children&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Noah’s children dishonored his father in some unwritten way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People will make mistakes but the godly thing to do is to look away from their foolishness and try to cover their shame (cover in a good way as in shield the foolishness from others, not in the sense of making excuses for it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Peter 4:8-9 Above all, keep loving one another earnestly since love covers a multitude of sins. Show hospitality to one another without grumbling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24 When Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his youngest son had done to him,
25 he said, “Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be to his brothers.”
26 He also said, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem; and let Canaan be his servant.
27 May God enlarge Japheth, and let him dwell in the tents of Shem, and let Canaan be his servant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have no idea what “uncovering his father’s nakedness means,” and it’s somewhat natural for our imaginations to run wild here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, the Bible is graphic in many places, so if even the BIBLE is not telling what it was it must have been really bad. Maybe or maybe not. We aren’t told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shouldn’t assume something “done” to Noah is physical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merely mocking Noah’s nakedness, especially if done by a son, would be doing harm to Noah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not honoring one’s father and mother is to do wrong to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern modesty vs immodesty&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a ridiculously hypersexualized world and we are exposed to things we wish we didn’t have to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the choice to be like Shem and Japheth who turn our backs and maintain boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expressions of intimacy are appropriate (and are only appropriate) between a husband and wife but this needs to be kept within the privacy of their own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also don’t know why Canaan is directly cursed instead of Ham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One speculation is the Canaanites were the people group the Israelites were most familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another view is that this is a prophecy of the wicked Canaanites, who will need to be expunged from the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other places in the Bible, “to uncover the nakedness of” a man means to have relations with the man’s wife. See Leviticus 18 and 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other time Nakedness and drunkenness are described in the same event is Genesis 19 with Lot and his daughters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One theory is Canaan was the offspring of an incestuous relationship, but this view is problematic.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, there is more going on than we are being told, but that’s how the Bible goes sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible tells us everything we need to know, not always everything we’d want to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blessing and cursing appear to come from Noah, not God. There is no “thus sayeth the LORD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of Shem and Japheth, Shem is given the larger blessing (specifically the LORD of Shem) – Lord Messiah will come through the line of Shem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:80%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note three distinct categories of people&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shem – Semites; primarily Jews and Arabs. Also Assyria, Persia, Arabia. It’s Shem’s tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japheth – (loosely) Europe, Turkey, Russia. Japheth will dwell in Shem’s tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ham – all of the “…ites” that are the traditional enemies of Israel. Ham will be in subjugation to Shem and Japheth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this, note the Messianic application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messiah and Messiah’s people are in the line of Shem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japheth represents those gentiles who will be joined to Messiah (dwell in the tents of Shem)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ham represents those who will be subjugated under Messiah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a personal application, all are welcome to be joined to Messiah (or to reject Him) regardless of bloodline, but from a national application, the geography of Ham appears to line up with the nations that lead the charge against the Lord and his anointed in the end of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-928-29-noah-dies-at-950&#34;&gt;Gen 9:28-29 Noah Dies at 950&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;28 After the flood Noah lived 350 years.
29 All the days of Noah were 950 years, and he died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we do the math, Noah lived almost until the time of Abraham and Seth WAS a contemporary of Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, Abraham could have talked with his great-great…grandfather Shem who was on the Ark. And Shem could have talked with his great-great grandfather Methuselah who knew Adam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah also witnessed his own offspring going bad at the Tower of Babel, which we will get to in the next lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-seven-noachide-laws-of-genesis-9-and-the-acts-15-council&#34;&gt;The Seven Noachide Laws of Genesis 9 and the Acts 15 Council&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although God instituted a new beginning, as we saw from chapter 8, nothing about man’s heart had changed. One reason this new period is called the “Age of government” is that we see God instituting some precise instructions. From Genesis 9:1-6, there are four overt commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be fruitful and multiply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not eat meat with lifeblood (or do not eat un-bled meat).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put murderers to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;three-classes-of-people&#34;&gt;Three classes of people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient Jewish sages read between the lines and determined seven general laws. In the sages’ opinion, these laws are self-evident and therefore binding on ALL humanity. As history unfolds, the Hebrews will later be held to an even higher standard. As we review this list, let’s keep in mind Jesus’ statements that He came to fulfill, not abolish, the Jewish Torah, as well as the four prohibitions given to the early gentile believers in Acts 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin our discussion, we need to recognize that there are three classes of people from the Torah’s perspective. We often think of only Jews and Gentiles, but to the Jewish person, there are two categories of gentiles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The b’nei Israel: natural-born Jews and legal gentile proselytes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required to keep full Torah&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ger toshav: Resident aliens/(righteous) gentiles who attached themselves to the God and people of Israel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required to keep Noachide and portions of the Torah&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goyim; the (unbelieving) gentile nations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Required to keep Noachide Laws&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that they largely did not, proves their wickedness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;composition-of-the-acts-15-church&#34;&gt;Composition of the Acts 15 church&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the early church went forth from the day of Pentecost in Acts 2, all of the early believers were Jewish and therefore approached faith in Messiah from this common Jewish perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the church grew, eventually Gentiles without any Jewish frame of reference started coming to the faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These gentiles fellowshipped alongside of their believing Jewish counterpart, they worshiped together and shared meals together. As Paul notes in Romans 10-11, the gentile believers are considered spiritual sons of Abraham, so no one was doubting they were “saved” as we think of the term, but practically we can see how this living side-by-side created a bit of a difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those advocating for full Jewishness, did so in part because they simply wanted to eliminate the tension that the gentile believers created by living so closely with their Jewish counterparts. This was a practical solution. However, the problem with this option is that it is not supported by the Torah, which clearly provides three classes of people. Jew, Ger toshav and goyim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, according to the torah, proselytization is voluntary. Although forced conversions have been done throughout history; God never sanctions this. So it would be inconsistent for the early church to have instituted forced conversions. It’s also unreasonable to expect an adult new convert to take on the full weight of the Torah, which is something that the natural-born Jews would have studied since their childhood. The other side of the same coin is that Moses allowed for a category of &lt;em&gt;ger toshav&lt;/em&gt; so it would have been inconsistent for the early church NOT to allow this category. Yet the early church fathers knew that there had to be some distinction between the &lt;em&gt;ger toshav&lt;/em&gt; that believed in Messiah and the goyim, the pagan Romans who did not. These are the questions before the Acts 15 council. Let’s look at how they responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;acts-1512-21&#34;&gt;Acts 15:12-21&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all the assembly fell silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles. After they finished speaking, James replied, “Brothers, listen to me. Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles, to take from them a people for his name. And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written, “‘After this I will return, and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen; I will rebuild its ruins, and I will restore it, that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles who are called by my name, says the Lord, who makes these things known from of old.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God, but should write to them &lt;strong&gt;to abstain from the things polluted by idols, and from sexual immorality, and from what has been strangled, and from blood&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;For from ancient generations Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him, for he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we try to understand the context of Acts 15, we’ll want to be asking a series of questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why only these four?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were and are these four the ONLY laws binding on gentile believers or were there others not mentioned that would have been understood?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did the Apostles view these four as the only laws that would ever be binding on Gentiles or was this a starting place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passage in acts ends with the statement about moses being proclaimed every week. Why does a statement on gentiles conclude with Jewish Moses being read every Jewish Sabbath in the Jewish synagogues?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers to these questions, I believe, lie in understanding the background of the Noachide laws. So let’s dig into those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-seven-noachide-laws&#34;&gt;The seven Noachide Laws&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: there is no official order of the seven laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not worship idols or other gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God spoke directly to Job, Noah, Adam, and others who were not Jews, (they were pre-Abraham who was the first Jew). Thus the sages viewed monotheism as self-evident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prohibits worshipping any created thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prohibits creating any object for the purpose of veneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prohibits occult arts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, “the Torah’s numerous laws that deal with idolatry pertain to Gentiles.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostles believed this was self-evident and not necessary to repeat in Acts 15. There is a problem with meat sacrificed to idols that we’ll get to later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not blaspheme God’s name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages took this from the story of Job, who was also not Jewish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job 2:9-10 Then his wife said to him, “Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die.” But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. Shall we receive good from God, and shall we not receive evil?” In all this Job did not sin with his lips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this also comes the Jewish custom to speak a blessing even when one hears bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This law includes the prohibitions on making false oaths, swearing falsely in the name of the LORD, or taking the LORD’s name in vain.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems here too, the Torah’s laws on blasphemy apply to Gentiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostles saw the second law as self-evident to the gentile believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would not have been necessary to repeat this for new gentile believers in Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their idolatrous world, they believed that to speak poorly of a deity was to invite his or her wrath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not exactly the same, the same general mindset would have transferred over to their new belief in Jesus and God the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not murder or participate in bloodshed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another self-evident command the apostles saw no need to repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every civilization that has ever existed condemns murder, though they have different definitions as to what constitutes murder (as does our American society by the way. Think about it.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At a basic level, Judaism and western societies draw a distinction between murder and killing accidentally without intent (manslaughter), killing in self-defense, killing in war, or killing in capital punishment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the flood, God allowed Cain to live and this was correlated to the wickedness of Cain’s line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in Genesis 9, God prescribes the death penalty for murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included with the prohibition not to murder, includes conspiracy to commit murder even if the person in question does not literally murder the person (David for example), and the killing of oneself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps an area where the Torah goes further would be to say that a Jew who is able to prevent the death of another and fails to do so transgresses the prohibition against murder. Jewish law also provided Cities of Refuge where an assailant could claim manslaughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish law also has laws against evil speech and character assassination, which the Torah equates with murder. Lev 19:16 You shall not go around as a slanderer among your people, and you shall not stand up against the life of your neighbor: I am the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus similarly affirmed evil speech and anger was murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 5: 21-24: “You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.’ But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the hell of fire. So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First, be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that it doesn’t say if you have something against your brother, but if your brother has something against you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Gentile non-believers may have a slightly lower standard for murder than what the Torah prescribes for Jewish people, but followers of Jesus have the same expectations as the intent of the Torah regarding murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.07843in;height:4.05114in&#34; alt=&#34;A picture containing stone Description automatically generated&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not commit sexual immorality / engage in illicit sexuality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages derived this command from Genesis 2:24 Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh” and the repeated commands to “be fruitful and multiply.” The sages viewed fornication and all other forms of sexual immorality as the antitheses of this command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mankind and our sinful desires try to define this as narrowly as possible, but the sages are clear that sexual relations with anyone other than one’s spouse are forbidden, and this applies to all gentiles by virtue of the command coming in Genesis 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet many cultures redefined what is and is not sexual immoral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one went into a temple prostitute, that was an act of worship because you wanted God to bless the fertility of your crops, so that was ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Greek and roman times, this later morphed into sex acts for general blessing (if you wanted pan, the goat god to bless you, it was bad luck to be a goat).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the culture the gentile converts were emerging from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To all of this, the Torah said absolutely not. Sex was to be between a man and his wife just as it was decreed in Genesis 2. All other unions were forbidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Acts 15:20, the apostles affirmed that Torah’s definition and standards of “Sexual immorality” apply to gentile followers of Jesus. They drew this authority from Leviticus 18:26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Lev 18:26&lt;/sup&gt; But you shall keep my statutes and my rules and do none of these (sexual) abominations, either the native or the stranger who sojourns among you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 26 follows a list of forbidden sexual unions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Torah passage concludes by saying that these unions are abominations that are prohibited not only for the native Jew but for the ger toshav, the stranger who sojourns among you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess what, they still apply to Gentile followers of Jesus today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This issue is one that truly needed clarification and redefining for new believers exiting the world of idolatry and immorality. Therefore, we have the statement in Acts 15 regarding sexual purity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo above from one room of a brothel discovered in Pompeii, along with graphic artwork and inscriptions, provides an illustration of the degraded practices of the Roman world that new Gentile believers would be coming from.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bolen concludes, “Sexual immorality was rampant in the Greco-Roman world and church leaders made it clear that non-Jewish followers of Messiah could have no part in such activities.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not steal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dishonest dealings and robbery were factors that brought on the flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Includes not only theft of personal property, but kidnapping, swindling, extortion, dishonesty, overcharging, unjust weights, moving boundary stones, encroaching on another’s livelihood, and paying dishonest wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Torah includes seduction and rape (as well as other forms of assault) under the theft prohibitions as there is theft of dignity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any act that takes advantage of someone else is prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The non-believing gentile world may not agree with these definitions of “theft,” but, as we are seeing, Gentile believers in Jesus must follow the Torah’s standards for ethical conduct and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This topic was globally understood and did not need to be repeated by the Acts 15 council. Although as we grow in Christ our level of ethics should grow as well. Paul will touch on these themes in his letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establish courts of justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is inferred from Genesis 9:6 “Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed, for God made man in his own image.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to having this be binding on all gentiles, the sages viewed it as implying that trials for capital crimes must be done in a lawful, fair, and just manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Torah’s many laws of justice, legal procedure, litigation, tort law, fines, penalties, and rules are included in this category” that apply universally to all human beings.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establish courts of justice is more of a national command than an individual one, but still, the general concept was understood and did not need to be restated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not eat meat with lifeblood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question regarding extent the Jewish dietary restrictions should be applied to gentiles permeates throughout the New Testament and into the book of Revelation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the Noachide prohibition applies to eating animals that are still alive, which (thankfully) by modern 21st-century standards in our culture is repulsive to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding dietary purity, we have a clear difference between Jewish dietary laws and those of the gentile world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While both Jews and Gentiles could not eat an animal that is alive, Jews are further prohibited from eating animals that were not slaughtered appropriately. Deuteronomy 14 even says that if a Jew comes across an animal that has died of itself, he may give it to a gentile to eat but he himself may not eat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jews are also restricted from eating certain classes of animals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We gentiles may think there are only two categories of food for Jews,“clean and unclean”, but there are actually three – and unclean food may not be what you think it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean Food – “clean” animals approved by the Torah AND sacrificed/prepared in a kosher manner according to the Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unclean Food – “clean” animals approved by the Torah BUT NOT sacrificed/prepared in a kosher manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Not food&lt;/u&gt; – “unclean” animals not approved by the Torah for food (this list includes pork and shellfish)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unclean animals are not unclean food. Unclean animals are not food at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we may have a little departure from the previous Noachide laws as they apply to Gentile Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Acts 15, the apostles give three specific commands from the Torah (no food with lifeblood, no food sacrificed to idols, and no strangled animals), but appear to stop short of imposing the full gamut of kosher food laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:5.40556in&#34; alt=&#34;A picture containing text, indoor, plant, jar Description automatically generated&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;9&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food sacrificed to idols”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostles drew this from Leviticus 17:7-9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Lev 17:7-9&lt;/sup&gt; So they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices to goat demons, after whom they whore. This shall be a statute forever for them throughout their generations. “And you shall say to them, Any one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among them, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice and does not bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to offer it to the LORD, that man shall be cut off from his people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the inclusion of house of Israel OR the stranger who sojourns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is different from the general prohibition on idolatry, which as we already looked at was self-evident and did not need to be repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prohibitions on things sacrificed to idols goes one step further “It requires a heightened distancing from idolatry based upon the Torah’s prohibitions” that apply not only to the house of Israel but also to the strangers who sojourn among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to remember EVERYTHING in the roman empire was sacrified to idols. This restriction would have presented a major hardship for gentile believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo above shows a man bringing offerings to an altar.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.65139in&#34; alt=&#34;A picture containing meal Description automatically generated&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;10&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And from blood”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostles drew this from Leviticus 17:10-11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Lev 17:10-11&lt;/sup&gt; “If any one of the house of Israel or of the strangers who sojourn among them eats any blood, I will set my face against that person who eats blood and will cut him off from among his people. For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it for you on the altar to make atonement for your souls, for it is the blood that makes atonement by the life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blood restriction is in the context of diet and is not the same as murder which the apostles believed was self-evident and did not need to be repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prohibition on blood appears to mirror Genesis 9 but many had come to interpret Genesis 9 as not eating an animal while it’s still alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other cultures held that ingesting blood in other contexts was ok and some pagan rituals involving blood had emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Egyptians had no issue with drinking the blood of animals. This photo shows a model slaughter house where they are collecting blood from butchered cattle to make blood pudding.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;8.  The apostles are saying Gentile converts are to have no part of this and are held to the same standards as Jews. Again we see the phrase “house of Israel or of the strangers who sojourn among them.”
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;11&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And from things strangled”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostles drew this authority from Leviticus 17:12-14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Lev 17:12-14&lt;/sup&gt; Therefore I have said to the people of Israel, No person among you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger who sojourns among you eat blood. “Any one also of the people of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among them, who takes in hunting any beast or bird that may be eaten &lt;u&gt;shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth.&lt;/u&gt; For the life of every creature is its blood: its blood is its life. Therefore I have said to the people of Israel, You shall not eat the blood of any creature, for the life of every creature is its blood. Whoever eats it shall be cut off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, gentile believers should only be eating food that has been slaughtered and drained properly. We could call this kosher slaughter, but there is a caveat that modern kashrut standards are much stricter than what is outlined in the Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example is that modern standards hold that the back portion of a clean animal is not kosher unless the sciatic nerve is excised, which is a complicated and expensive process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless that is done, no fliet mignion or chicken thighs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a tradition that draws on a statement about Jacob’s hip, that is not directly stated in the Bible with regards to muscle meat from a clean animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are left to speculate whether it is consistent for Jewish apostles to all of a sudden say category 3 above is now OK to eat, versus whether they only intended to permit certain foods from category 2 but continued to prohibit category 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, we do know that a late 1st-century document called The Didache, contained this instruction for new believers: “Concerning (the Jewish) food (laws): do as much as you are able” (Didache 6:3).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than insisting we have the freedom in Christ to eat pork and shrimp, we don’t give a lot of thought to what we eat with respect to the dietary restrictions listed in Acts 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet will you notice how important the issue was to the early church. This debate continued throughout the first century and was not settled by the time we get to the seven churches in Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus had to remind several churches regarding his expectations for clean eating as well as sexual purity (are the two linked somehow?). &lt;sup&gt;Rev 2:14&lt;/sup&gt; But I have a few things against you: you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, &lt;strong&gt;so that they might eat food sacrificed to idols and practice sexual immorality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that the four requirements of Acts 15 appear to be taken from the Noachide laws, or at least bear some similarity. “The existence of the laws of Noah explains why the apostles felt no need to write out a new (set of rules) for the Gentiles, or to spell out the obvious moral and ethical statutes of Judaism such as prohibitions on murder, theft, idolatry, etc. All these laws already applied to all human beings.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a classification, the first gentile believers are in a different class. They are more than simply “sons of Noah” who fall under the Noachide laws, yet the Acts 15 council determined that they are not full Jews (nor do they need to be) who are subject to the complete body of Jewish law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should note that the apostles were not teaching this was the maximum in terms of personal behavior that gentile believers needed to do. The four prohibitions were merely a common starting point for new believers coming out of idolatry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note another subtle point: those who say Christians are “no longer under the Torah” are simply incorrect. The authority behind the Acts 15 apostolic decree confirms this. We are held to a higher standard of ethics and behavior than a non-believing gentile. We are more than simply sons of Noah. We are sons of Messiah. Of course note the chronology: the new gentile believers came to faith in Messiah and THEN were given the commands. We don’t keep biblical laws to get saved; we keep applicable Biblical laws because we already are saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, as we mature as believers, we will want to become more and more like Jesus. This means the way the world does things, or even many of our own former ways will no longer feel right to us. The expectation was that the four prohibitions were a starting point. The new gentile believers were to continue to meet weekly in Jewish synagogues and study Torah. As they did this they would be expected to grow in maturity and, gradually take on more of the Torah’s laws as a thank you to the God who saved them. We should be doing this too. We can apply The Didache’s words to just about any aspect of our behavior as we mature: “do as much as you are able.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time we will take a look at the Table of Nations and the Tower of Babel in Genesis chapters 10 and 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Thyatira, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the Son of God, whose eyes are like a fiery flame and whose feet are like burnished brass: (19) I know what you are doing, your love, trust, service, and perseverance. And I know that you are doing more now than before. (20) But I have this against you: you continue to tolerate that Izevel woman, the one who claims to be a prophet, but is teaching and deceiving my servants to commit sexual sin and eat food that has been sacrificed to idols. (21) I gave her time to turn from her sin, but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to repent of her immorality. (22) So I am throwing her into a sickbed; and those who commit adultery with her I am throwing into great trouble unless they turn from the sins connected with what she does; (23) and I will strike her children dead! Then all the Messianic communities will know that I am the one who searches minds and hearts and that I will give to each of you what your deeds deserve. (24) But to the rest of you in Thyatira, to those who do not hold this teaching, who have not learned what some people call the &amp;lsquo;deep things&amp;rsquo; of the Adversary, I say this: I am not loading you up with another burden; (25) only hold fast to what you have until I come. (26) To him who wins the victory and does what I want until the goal is reached, I will give him authority over the nations; (27) he will rule them with a staff of iron and dash them to pieces like pottery, (28) just as I have received authority from my Father. I will also give him the morning star. (29) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.&amp;rdquo; &#39;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;thyatira-background&#34;&gt;Thyatira Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/159dbe0ff890eaf317e21c9759ccb3e3.png&#34; cap=&#34;Thyatira map&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thyatira is located 42 miles inland on a flat plain. Its location was bad from a military perspective but good from a trade perspective. Thyatira was strategically located on a highway connecting it with Pergamum and Troas (and today Istanbul) to the north, Smyrna to the west, and Sardis to the south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thyatira is related to θυγάτηρ, thygater, or &amp;ldquo;daughter.&amp;rdquo; After Seleucus I (Nicator) took control of the city in 301 BCE, he named the location θυατειροις (Thyateirois) in honor of his daughter.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many devotional (as opposed to scholarly) commentaries reflect that the name means &amp;ldquo;continual sacrifice,&amp;rdquo; but only one scholarly reference that I could identify confirmed this, and this author did so without providing any references supporting the Greek interpretation.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m skeptical of this interpretation. It sounds more to me like Protestant commentators contrived these meanings as a dig towards Catholics to support the &amp;ldquo;Church Age Theory&amp;rdquo; linking Thyatira to the Catholic/Papal church and the Doctrine of the Mass. Despite differences Protestants may have with Catholic doctrine (and vice-versa), we must be devoted to the truth, not Protestant folklore. I will be glad to post a correction to this paragraph should I come across a hard source supporting one of these alternate names as a potential interpretation of the Koine Greek. Until this time, I would encourage readers to be equally skeptical. &amp;ldquo;Daughter&amp;rdquo; appears to be a straightforward Greek interpretation and is entirely consistent with the extra-biblical historical narrative. Remember Acts 17:11, which is our charge to accept the truth and reject falsehoods, no matter how much they may &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo; or how much we may wish they were true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does have more scholarly support, though still disputed, is that a former name of the city was &amp;ldquo;Semiramis,&amp;rdquo; a mythical goddess common to multiple ancient cultures. Again, in what is likely to be a Protestant misunderstanding (taking a charitable view of it), a book written in 1853 puts forth the suggestion that Semiramis was the mother of Nimrod, the Bible&amp;rsquo;s first apostate, and they had an incestuous relationship resulting in Tammuz and the Babylonian pagan system which ultimately found their way into the Catholic Church&amp;rsquo;s practices. There is no historical record supporting the book&amp;rsquo;s claims, yet to this day, they are passed on as true by many Protestant commentators. So while it was true that Thyatira was likely named Semiramis, the mythical Semiramis&amp;rsquo; connection to the Catholic church seems entirely fabricated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can speculate that the reasons protestant commentators go to such lengths to force a connection between Thyatira and the Catholic Church are twofold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is where the Church-Age Theory (largely a Protestant creation) starts to feel contrived.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People can feel the need to force evidence to support a theory where no evidence exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not to say that there aren&amp;rsquo;t any parallels. Instead of spreading urban legends, all they needed to do was focus on the historical Jezebel (which WE will do once we get to verse 20!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we hold to the theory, the next church, Sardis, would represent the Reformation period. There is NOTHING good said about Sardis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not saying connections aren&amp;rsquo;t there, but let&amp;rsquo;s not oversell them. Our job is to be true to the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter to Thyatira is the longest of the seven letters, but it is the city we know the least about. It seems fair to perhaps label it the &amp;ldquo;least significant&amp;rdquo; of the seven cities, but we don&amp;rsquo;t know what secrets the earth holds. This is because archaeological excavations have been limited by the modern city of Akhisar (~ 30,000 people).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/a9b38e7232457060274689fa53494404.jpg&#34; cap=&#34;Thyatira Greek Inscription mentioning wool workers &#34; width=&#34;30%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentary evidence, including the Book of Acts, does demonstrate that the city was known for its trade guilds. Various inscriptions found, such as the one in the photo, list some of these guilds: wool workers, linen-workers, makers of outer garments, dyers, leather-workers, tanners, potters, bakers, slave-dealers and bronze-smiths.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Evidence indicates that the city was at the height of its prosperity in the very late 1st century, exactly when they would have received this letter. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guilds gathered at the temple of Apollo.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In Greek mythology, Apollo is also the twin brother of Artemis, which we studied at Ephesus, and the father of Asclepius at Pergamum. He is the god of music and the arts and also the Sun. As we have learned in the previous letters, just about everything in Roman society was connected with the worship of the Roman gods. The worship of Apollo included lots of sex, eating, and drinking.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, guild worship wasn&amp;rsquo;t simply an annual or quarterly business meeting where one could pinch his nose and suffer through it. &amp;ldquo;Each guild had its own god, pagan feasts, celebrations, and other rituals.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In other words, it was inescapable, ongoing worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/348bc9668852b3e79fde186f3fb02ab4.jpg&#34; cap=&#34;Thyatira arches along colonnaded Roman street tb01217839&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus will again reference sexual immorality and eating things sacrificed to idols. Thyatira may have been committing the same sins but for different reasons. At Thyatira, believers involved with one of the trades represented by the guilds were placed in a seemingly impossible situation. If he didn&amp;rsquo;t participate in the Apollo worship (or whichever other god a given trade venerated), he would be expelled from the guild.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The equivalent today would be having your business license revoked or being blacklisted by those in power. You would not be allowed to practice your trade or craft. If you went along with it, even half-heartedly, you were a compromiser, and we know from the previous letters how Jesus feels about compromisers versus those who remain true to His name. While whoever &amp;ldquo;Jezebel&amp;rdquo; was evidently was advocating compromise, Jesus told them it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth it, literally. It&amp;rsquo;s too expensive in that there is too much at state eternally.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thyatira receives only one other mention outside the book of Revelation. Acts 16:14 tells us that Paul met Lydia in Philippi, and she was his first convert in that city. Lydia was a Jew from Thyatira and was a seller of the rare purple (or scarlet) dye mentioned by Homer in the Iliad. While there is a theory that holds the dye is made from sea muscles, Thyatira&amp;rsquo;s inland location would support the alternative theory that the dye is plant-based from the madder root.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The photo shows skins dyed with madder root (Rubia tinctorum).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Bolen adds, &amp;ldquo;The process of extracting the dye was not a simple or quick one, causing the dyed cloth to be expensive.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears the area was largely unoccupied (or at best an insignificant outpost) for most of the middle ages, with Akhisar being refounded in the Ottoman period. Since 1922 there have been no Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;prelude&#34;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to find that the issues of following in the ways of Balaam/Pergamum and Jezebel/Thyatira are very closely related in that they both involve compromise. Balaam wants to come alongside God and offer you something extra. Balaam couldn&amp;rsquo;t curse Israel, but he did entice and ensnare them. Balaam says it&amp;rsquo;s ok to have one foot worshipping Israel&amp;rsquo;s God as long as you have one foot in the world, worshipping the things of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jezebel is in opposition and wants to corrupt God. In other words, even the one foot that you are following God with is changed into something it&amp;rsquo;s not supposed to be. Both are bad. Satan will use either one or any combination to attack you and me and keep us from worshipping Him how He requires. This includes our ability to deceive ourselves into thinking ___ is ok (fill in the blank), even though God has said it&amp;rsquo;s not. &amp;ldquo;The danger to the church at Thyatira arose from within the church itself – all the more serious and dangerous to deal with.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler noted three &amp;ldquo;tares&amp;rdquo; in the early church based on the letters so far:&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legalism– this is a denial of Christ&amp;rsquo;s work
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Legalism&amp;rdquo; means a certain work is required &lt;em&gt;in order to merit salvation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holding ourselves to a high standard of behavior and performance as a RESPONSE TO Christ&amp;rsquo;s work is not legalism
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accusers of the brethren disparage good works as &amp;ldquo;legalism.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gnosticism – denial of Christ&amp;rsquo;s humanity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caesar worship – denial of Christ&amp;rsquo;s Lordship&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;td&gt;18 &amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Thyatira, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the Son of God, whose eyes are like a fiery flame and whose feet are like burnished brass:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Psa 2:7 I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, “You are my Son; today I have begotten you.  &lt;br&gt; Dan 10:6 His body was like beryl, his face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude. &lt;br&gt; Mal 3:2-4 But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner&amp;rsquo;s fire and like fullers&amp;rsquo; soap. (3) He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, and they will bring offerings in righteousness to the LORD. (4) Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD as in the days of old and as in former years.  &lt;br&gt; Mat 3:17 and behold, a voice from heaven said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”  &lt;br&gt; Mat 16:15-16 He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” (16) Simon Peter replied, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”  &lt;br&gt; Joh 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be surprising to learn that this is the only instance of &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Son of God&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; mentioned in Revelation. A local allusion may be in reference to the Apollo worship in the city. Apollo is the Son of Zeus. In English (but not in Greek), there is an unintended pun in that Apollo is also the sun god. There are lots of verses in both Testaments referencing God&amp;rsquo;s Son. We have a few listed here. Although it sounds counter-intuitive, the Bible uses the phrase &amp;ldquo;Son of God&amp;rdquo; to emphasize one&amp;rsquo;s humanity, while the Son of Man (except for the book of Ezekiel) represents the messiah&amp;rsquo;s divinity. The &amp;ldquo;one like a son of man&amp;rdquo; is always a diety in Daniel and also here in Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is noteworthy that Son of God is not a title mentioned in Revelation 1. Note that we aren&amp;rsquo;t just relying on an angel, messenger, or human. This is the Son of God. The Son is an Heir to all things. Messiah is fully divine and fully human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eyes like a fiery flame&lt;/strong&gt; could refer to the fact that He has been watching the goings-on in Thyatira as He watches all assemblies. This letter is notable in that there is no offer for the wicked to repent because &amp;quot; I gave her time to turn from her sin, but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to repent of her immorality.&amp;rdquo; Likely it was a leader of the congregation who pointed out these heresies of the one called Jezebel, but Jesus, like the second witness required by the Torah, says, &amp;ldquo;I saw everything that happened. You&amp;rsquo;re guilty, and you know it.&amp;rdquo; Lest we get smug, He could say that to us too; let us repent of whatever we need to repent of while we still have time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire,&lt;/strong&gt; in this case, could mean either the fires of judgment (for the unbeliever) or purifying fires that refine for believers. A refiner&amp;rsquo;s fire removes things in our life that don&amp;rsquo;t need to be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burnished brass&lt;/strong&gt; is likely a local allusion to the bronzesmith&amp;rsquo;s guild in Thyatira. Thyatira was a leading manufacturer of bronze helmets for the Roman army. In conjunction with fire, brass withstands fire up to 1800 degrees Fahrenheit. Biblically, it is often used as a symbol of judgment, as with the bronze serpent we reviewed in the letter to Pergamum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While five of the seven letters describe a judgment, this letter seems to have a unique emphasis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(19) I know what you are doing, your love, trust, service, and perseverance. And I know that you are doing more now than before.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Job 17:9  Yet the righteous holds to his way,  and he who has clean hands grows stronger and stronger.&lt;br&gt;  Pro 4:18  But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn,  which shines brighter and brighter until full day.&lt;br&gt;  John 15:2 Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.&lt;br&gt; Gal 5:22-23 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, (23) gentleness, self-control; against such things, there is no law. &lt;br&gt;Th 1:3 We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers, as is right, because your faith is growing abundantly, and the love of every one of you for one another is increasing.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He concludes a longer list of positive things by saying He knows they are doing more than before. This contrasts with Ephesus, who started strong but fell off. Everyone can start well; it takes determination to finish well. Coasting is not consistent with the Christian walk. If you think you&amp;rsquo;re coasting, you&amp;rsquo;re actually moving backward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is natural to continue to verse 20 without reflecting on verse 19. These are the things we need to focus on as believers. Several are duplicates of the Fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5. This parallel is noteworthy as some scholars see Galatians as the Pauline tie-in for Thyatira.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gal 5:22-23 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, (23) gentleness, self-control; against such things, there is no law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love – Love for God and love for one another needs to be the first priority of our works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trust/Faith – confidence and faithfulness to God – clinging to the promises that are as yet unseen despite our circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Service – sacrificial selflessness in giving our time, talents, and possessions to one another in His name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perseverance – longsuffering for the Master, various trials without bitterness or retaliation. Patient endurance with one another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving – they are getting better at doing all of the above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What wonderful words to hear from Jesus. I read a &amp;ldquo;lifehack&amp;rdquo; a while ago. The instructions were to write two obituaries for yourself. Make the first one painfully truthful – describe you as you truly know yourself, including the stuff you hide from others (or what you may THINK you are hiding, but maybe not hiding so well). Make the second one the one you would want to be read at your funeral. Are there differences between the two versions? If so, make course corrections will you still have time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would definitely want it said I exemplified these five things, especially by Jesus. Which of these do you do I need to work on? Are there areas where we used to be stronger, but we have fallen off? Redeem the time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one warning with perseverance or patient endurance, and it comes in verse 20. It is possible to be TOO patient with people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(20) But I have this against you: you continue to tolerate that Izevel woman, the one who claims to be a prophet, but is teaching and deceiving my servants to commit sexual sin and eat food that has been sacrificed to idols.  &lt;br&gt;(21) I gave her time to turn from her sin, but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to repent of her immorality.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deu 13:1-5 “If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or a wonder, (2) and the sign or wonder that he tells you comes to pass, and if he says, ‘Let us go after other gods,’ which you have not known, ‘and let us serve them,’ (3) you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams. … (5) But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death because he has taught rebellion against the LORD your God…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toleration&lt;/strong&gt; is the great buzzword of our age. In fact, the world tells us that tolerance is the greatest virtue ever in the history of humankind. In typical Satan fashion, he takes a verse like &amp;ldquo;love your neighbor&amp;rdquo; and tells us that the command means we must accept every sin and vice imaginable in the name of &amp;ldquo;tolerance.&amp;rdquo; Of course, those same people become most intolerant of people who don&amp;rsquo;t think as they do. And those targets are often Christians and Jews, which tells me right there that the battle is spiritual, not physical. Jesus says the wrong kind of toleration is not just a sin but evidence of a lack of salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this is exactly what happens when someone rises up and divides a community of believers – everyone tolerates it. Note the bigger sin is not Jezebel herself but those who tolerate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Izevel&lt;/strong&gt; could mean &amp;ldquo;what garbage&amp;rdquo; in Hebrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely the Thyatiran false prophetess was literally named Jezebel, as that would be an unusual name in that region. Some commentators speculate that this may be a corrosive philosophy, not a literal person, but we must note Jesus says that they tolerate &amp;ldquo;that woman.&amp;rdquo; This appears to be a continuation of the deeds of the Nicolaitans. The order is inverted compared to Pergamum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Rev 2:14 so that they might eat food sacrificed to idols and practice sexual immorality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Rev 2:20 seducing my servants to practice sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As discussed with Pergamum, sexual immorality may be physical or spiritual. Anytime God&amp;rsquo;s people are unfaithful and allow other idols to be worshiped, He views that as spiritual cheating. It is clear that Jezebel and those at other fellowships are preaching that the requirements of Acts 15:28-29 are to be ignored. Lancaster describes, &amp;ldquo;this teaching allows you to live in both worlds. You could have your salvation AND eat food sacrificed to idols and participate in the lax moral standards of society, ignoring the stricter rules of monogamous Jewish fidelity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; She is teaching others to set aside the authority (a term used below) of the Apostles. Jesus will say what actual authority is in verse 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, this is an allusion to the Jezebel of the Old Testament. Jezebel would undoubtedly be among the top 5 greatest Old Testament villains. She was a Phoenician princess who married the Kings of Israel to secure a profitable trade alliance. &amp;ldquo;Of all the women seen in the Old Testament, none was more cunning, daring, or unscrupulous&amp;rdquo; than Jezebel.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In contrast to Balaam, who brought paganism alongside the worship of Israel&amp;rsquo;s god, Jezebel brought paganism instead of the worship of Israel&amp;rsquo;s God. It&amp;rsquo;s a fine line, but it might help to think of Balaam (technically not an Israelite) as an external attack and Jezebel (an Israelite by marriage) as representing an internal attack. In either case, the outcome is the same. God&amp;rsquo;s people compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Jezebel&amp;rsquo;s Religious System: Elijah at Mt. Carmel&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;images/24239523d7c57137ed25e082d72fccb5.jpeg&#34; cap=&#34;amaria Jezreel Valley Map, PLBL 2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When we go to Israel, we typically visit Mount Carmel and remember Elijah&amp;rsquo;s famous showdown with the priests of Baal recorded in 1 Kings 18. Elijah proposed a duel between Adonai and Baal; whichever god could bring fire from heaven and consume a sacrifice, that god would be the true god. The other fact is Elijah was the underdog of sorts. There were 450 prophets of Baal versus only Elijah. Baal was up first. Despite the pleadings and theatrics from Baal&amp;rsquo;s priests, along with some Monty Python-esque taunting from Elijah, nothing happens. Then it&amp;rsquo;s Adonai&amp;rsquo;s turn. Elijah even gives himself a handicap by dousing his altar with water multiple times. God delivers. Of course, those who are cheering for the home team are happy and celebratory.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;img src=&#34;images/cac94a62e71f3125c1cc36c13bc976e4.jpeg&#34; cap=&#34;Muhraqa statue, tb n011400 sr&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Elijah reminds us that this is not a football game. This is serious. 1Ki 18:40 &amp;ldquo;And Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.” And they seized them. And Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon and slaughtered them there. &amp;quot; Comingling of foreign gods must not be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode started by mentioning that Jezebel sought to exterminate the Prophets of Adonai, the true prophets (1 Kings 18:13). This location is a reminder that our faith must be pure and unadulterated. We follow the Bible. There is another story that we might say is &amp;ldquo;quintessential Jezebel.&amp;rdquo; It is the story of Naboth&amp;rsquo;s Vineyard in 1 Kings 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Quintessential Jezebel: Naboth&amp;rsquo;s Vineyard&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/f3802e7478a1924684110bbb59918f51.png&#34; cap=&#34;Tel Jezreel ariel from west - tb121704015&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Ki 21:1-23 Now Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel, beside the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. (2) And after this Ahab said to Naboth, “Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near my house, and I will give you a better vineyard for it; or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its value in money.” (3) But Naboth said to Ahab, “The LORD forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers.” (4) And Ahab went into his house vexed and sullen because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had said to him, for he had said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” And he lay down on his bed and turned away his face and would eat no food. (5) But Jezebel, his wife, came to him and said to him, “Why is your spirit so vexed that you eat no food?” (6) And he said to her, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, ‘Give me your vineyard for money, or else, if it please you, I will give you another vineyard for it.’ And he answered, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’” (7) And Jezebel, his wife, said to him, “Do you now govern Israel? Arise and eat bread and let your heart be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.” (8) So she wrote letters in Ahab&amp;rsquo;s name and sealed them with his seal, and she sent the letters to the elders and the leaders who lived with Naboth in his city. (9) And she wrote in the letters, “Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people. (10) And set two worthless men opposite him, and let them bring a charge against him, saying, ‘You have cursed God and the king.’ Then take him out and stone him to death.” (11) And the men of his city, the elders and the leaders who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent word to them. As it was written in the letters that she had sent to them, (12) they proclaimed a fast and set Naboth at the head of the people. (13) And the two worthless men came in and sat opposite him. And the worthless men brought a charge against Naboth in the presence of the people, saying, “Naboth cursed God and the king.” So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death with stones. (14) Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, “Naboth has been stoned; he is dead.” (15) As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, “Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money, for Naboth is not alive, but dead.” (16) And as soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;img src=&#34;images/049ccecfdf8ed8f7935214dd354741be.jpeg&#34; cap=&#34;Jezreel with grapevines, tb053005443&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;(17) Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, (18) “Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria; behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession. (19) And you shall say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD, “Have you killed and also taken possession?”’ And you shall say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD: “In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your own blood.”’” (20) Ahab said to Elijah, “Have you found me, O my enemy?” He answered, “I have found you because you have sold yourself to do what is evil in the sight of the LORD. (21) Behold, I will bring disaster upon you. I will utterly burn you up and will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel. (22) And I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the anger to which you have provoked me, and because you have made Israel to sin. (23) And of Jezebel, the LORD also said, ‘The dogs shall eat Jezebel within the walls of Jezreel.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is Jezebel. Pure evil. Those of a particular political persuasion see some parallels between Jezebel and a certain contemporary American politician, but we won&amp;rsquo;t get into that here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is one reason some commentators link the Letter to Thyatira with the Roman Catholic church. They acquired many of their lands through means like these and killed many of their enemies through false accusations. The most notorious episode is the Spanish Inquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About all, we can deduce from the Revelation text is that the Jezebel of Thyatira advocated for continuing worship at the trade guilds when Jesus would have His people remain pure and undefiled. This Jezebel didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have to be a rotten human being, but her doctrine definitely was wretched. However, as we can see from 1 Kings, calling someone &amp;ldquo;Jezebel&amp;rdquo; was NOT a compliment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because she calls herself a &lt;strong&gt;prophetess&lt;/strong&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that she is one. We are called to test the spirits and discern. Prophetesses were frequently leaders of Roman cults, but we see prophetesses in the New Testament as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teaching and deceiving my servants.&lt;/strong&gt; Deuteronomy 13 deals with the punishments for those who encourage the worship of other gods. Generally, it&amp;rsquo;s death. We are to have NO TOLERANCE for those who do such things. It is worth reading the chapter in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Deuteronomy 13&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Deu 13:1-18 “If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or a wonder, (2) and the sign or wonder that he tells you comes to pass, and if he says, ‘Let us go after other gods,’ which you have not known, ‘and let us serve them,’ (3) you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams. For the LORD your God is testing you, to know whether you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul. (4) You shall walk after the LORD your God and fear him and keep his commandments and obey his voice, and you shall serve him and hold fast to him. (5) But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he has taught rebellion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the house of slavery, to make you leave the way in which the LORD your God commanded you to walk. So you shall purge the evil from your midst. (6) “If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son or your daughter or the wife you embrace or your friend who is as your own soul entices you secretly, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods,’ which neither you nor your fathers have known, (7) some of the gods of the peoples who are around you, whether near you or far off from you, from the one end of the earth to the other, (8) you shall not yield to him or listen to him, nor shall your eye pity him, nor shall you spare him, nor shall you conceal him. (9) But you shall kill him. Your hand shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. (10) You shall stone him to death with stones because he sought to draw you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. (11) And all Israel shall hear and fear and never again do any such wickedness as this among you. (12) “If you hear in one of your cities, which the LORD your God is giving you to dwell there, (13) that certain worthless fellows have gone out among you and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods,’ which you have not known, (14) then you shall inquire and make search and ask diligently. And behold, if it be true and certain that such an abomination has been done among you, (15) you shall surely put the inhabitants of that city to the sword, devoting it to destruction, all who are in it and its cattle, with the edge of the sword. (16) You shall gather all its spoil into the midst of its open square and burn the city and all its spoil with fire, as a whole burnt offering to the LORD your God. It shall be a heap forever. It shall not be built again. (17) None of the devoted things shall stick to your hand, that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger and show you mercy and have compassion on you and multiply you, as he swore to your fathers, (18) if you obey the voice of the LORD your God, keeping all his commandments that I am commanding you today, and doing what is right in the sight of the LORD your God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God demands exclusive loyalty. Those who mix in paganism will be judged swiftly and publicly.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note exceptions: usually, in the judgment section, there is the opportunity to &lt;strong&gt;repent&lt;/strong&gt;. Not here. A true believer would want to repent. At some point, salvation is about a believer being fed up with their sin and wanting to do things differently. When confronted with evil, he or she would answer a call to repentance. This is not what Jezebel (or a Jezebel type) does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;(22) So I am throwing her into a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her I am throwing into great trouble unless they turn from the sins connected with what she does;  &lt;br&gt;(23) and I will strike her children dead! Then all the Messianic communities will know that I am the one who searches minds and hearts and that I will give to each of you what your deeds deserve.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rom 1:26 This is why God has given them up to degrading passions; &lt;br&gt;Deu 13:10 You shall stone him to death with stones because he sought to draw you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.  &lt;br&gt;Deu 13:11 And all Israel shall hear and fear and never again do any such wickedness as this among you. 1Ki 18:40 And Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.” And they seized them. And Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon and slaughtered them there.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They are throwing her into a sickbed&lt;/strong&gt;. This is likely used in the sense of Romans 1:26. Sometimes when a person has become so callous in his or her sin, the only thing God can do (usually after trying to get their attention in other ways) is to let them have at it in the hopes that they will hit rock bottom and repent. There was a scene where the children of Israel in the wilderness complained about the Manna, so God obliged. He sent them quail to eat. He sent them a lot of quail. So much that they gorged themselves and repented that they had asked for the quail, it&amp;rsquo;s the same with Jezebel. Whether the bed is literal or metaphoric, Jezebel has been using it for adultery, and now she&amp;rsquo;s going to be confined to it. This is the same sentiment as our English phrase, &amp;ldquo;you made your bed now lie in it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great trouble,&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;great tribulation&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s important to note there is no definite article in Greek. It is not THE great tribulation; it is just &amp;ldquo;great tribulation.&amp;rdquo; Θλιψιν μεγαλην. This literally means hardship that is grand in scope and does not directly denote a time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, scholars have pieced together the various &amp;ldquo;end times&amp;rdquo; passages and would say there is THE Great Tribulation that references a time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel 9 records a 70-year prophecy, where we presume a year is a week of years. There is a notable gap between the 69th and the 70th weeks. So the last week is equivalent to seven years. This is known by many names, including &amp;ldquo;the tribulation period, and &amp;ldquo;the time of Jacob&amp;rsquo;s trouble.&amp;rdquo; The seven years are further subdivided into two three-and-a-half-year periods. The first period is when Satan is spreading havoc on the earth. The second of these 3.5 year periods is God&amp;rsquo;s wrath. This is the period known as &amp;ldquo;The Great Tribulation.&amp;rdquo; The thought is people who don&amp;rsquo;t repent, if they are still living, will be cast into the Great Tribulation of God&amp;rsquo;s wrath poured out upon the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Searches&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;perceives&lt;/strong&gt; – the Greek implies a thorough investigation. Jesus reiterates that He is omniscient and sees all (in connection with verse 18).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children&lt;/strong&gt; – possibly natural illegitimate offspring, but more likely, &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo; means Jezebel&amp;rsquo;s disciples and the product or the result of this philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dead&lt;/strong&gt; – not just physical death, but given the context, the Second Death is also in view. This is the death reserved for unbelievers. For this is what those &lt;strong&gt;deeds deserve&lt;/strong&gt;. Deuteronomy 13 describes the punishment, and in 1 Kings 18, Elijah carries this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind and heart&lt;/strong&gt; – the Greek is nephrous kai kardias, which is a Hebrew idiom. Nephro, like nephrologist, pertains to the kidneys, and you probably recognize cardias from Cardiac, related to the heart. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit different than we think of in English, but Hebraiclly, the heart would be man&amp;rsquo;s conscious thoughts, the way we use the term &amp;ldquo;mind&amp;rdquo; in English. The kidneys, Hebraically, represent the subconsciousness: one&amp;rsquo;s deepest desires, closer to the way we would use &amp;ldquo;heart&amp;rdquo; in English. So &amp;ldquo;Mind and heart&amp;rdquo; is a fair translation of nephros and cardias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(24) But to the rest of you in Thyatira, to those who do not hold this teaching, who have not learned what some people call the &amp;lsquo;deep things&amp;rsquo; of the Adversary, I say this: I am not loading you up with another burden; &lt;br&gt;(25) only hold fast to what you have until I come.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Act 15:28-29 For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements: (29) that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.” 1Co 2:10 these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This teaching&lt;/strong&gt; – those who say they are going to feed their body digestively and sexually, however they want, regardless of what God&amp;rsquo;s word says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep things&lt;/strong&gt; – a tenet of Gnosticism is that they believed they had uncovered secret meaning. A plain reading of the Bible is not enough; one has to have the more profound knowledge that, conveniently, only they have. &amp;ldquo;Depths of Satan&amp;rdquo; is also fair. The teaching is satanic. Similar to &amp;ldquo;Jews who say they are not&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Synagogue of Satan,&amp;rdquo; this could also be a reversal. Jezebel is claiming to teach the more profound things of God, but Jesus said she is teaching the things of Satan. She could be misapplying 1 Corinthians and claiming that the Spirit taught her &amp;ldquo;deeper things of God.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve said it before, but we need to be very cautious with the phrase &amp;ldquo;I have freedom in Christ,&amp;rdquo; for this could be a teaching of Jezebel. Believers have standards and boundaries established by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another burden&lt;/strong&gt; seems to recall Acts 15:28 since this entire chapter, including Ephesus, Pergamum, and Thyatira, appears to be alluding to the Acts 15 council and four additional restrictions placed on the Gentile followers of Israel&amp;rsquo;s God and Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a possible pun here in Greek. The word for &amp;ldquo;deep things&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;bathos,&amp;rdquo; and the word for burden is &amp;ldquo;baros.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Until I come:&lt;/strong&gt; this is the first of the seven letters that have an explicit promise of His return, and it is expressed in each of the last four letters. From an application perspective, this is the proof from the Bible we need to interpret these letters as going beyond the original first-century context. We can&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;go there&amp;rdquo; on our own and come up with an interpretation that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have made sense to the original audience, but if the Bible itself makes it clear, then we can proceed, albeit with extreme caution. Jesus did not return to the Church of Thyatira or anywhere else in the first century. Therefore we know that some aspect of the letter to Thyatira is yet future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Psa 2:1-12 Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain? (2) The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and against his Anointed, saying, (3) “Let us burst their bonds apart and cast away their cords from us.” (4) He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord holds them in derision. (5) Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying, (6) “As for me, I have set my King on Zion, my holy hill.” (7) I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, “You are my Son; today I have begotten you. (8) Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession. (9) You shall break them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces like a potter&amp;rsquo;s vessel.” (10) Now therefore, O kings, be wise; be warned, O rulers of the earth. (11) Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. (12) Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the faithful and trustworthy overcomers, those who acknowledge God&amp;rsquo;s authority in this life, God will give tremendous authority in the kingdom. In Psalm 2, God the Father grants this authority to His Son. In Revelation 2, the Son delegates this authority to the Overcomers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Goyim versus Righteous Gentiles&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power over the nations was the goal of Jezebel, and for those who subscribe to the church age theory, it was also the goal of the Medieval Catholic Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might help to understand how a Jew sees the world. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple. There are Jews, and there are non-Jews. Non-Jews, i.e., gentiles, are called &amp;ldquo;goyim,&amp;rdquo; for nations. Goyim is the word used in Psalm 2:1. Traditionally and broadly, goyim are opposed to Jews and the God of Israel. In Matthew 18:17. The term &amp;ldquo;goyim&amp;rdquo; is generally used derisively on account of the historic mistreatment of Israel by the Nations since Egypt. In the Bible, Israel is set apart from the Nations, it is not one of the nations. We see a type of this in Genesis 11, which is the table of the Nations, and then Genesis 12 starts with the story of Abraham, who is called out of the nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an exception called &amp;ldquo;Righteous gentiles,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;righteous among the nations.&amp;rdquo; Specifically, these are the Europeans who risked their lives sheltering Jews from the Germans during the Holocaust. This is a formal title given by the state of Israel to such heroes. The term for &amp;ldquo;righteous gentile&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;ger toshav,&amp;rdquo; which we might translate as a resident alien, drawing from those in the Bible who attached themselves to the Israelites, or Chassid Umot ha-Olam, &amp;ldquo;Pious people of the world.&amp;rdquo; According to Judaism, a ger toshav is assured of a place in the world to come. What I find interesting is that neither expression uses the term &amp;ldquo;goyim.&amp;rdquo; As Gentile believers, I would say we are called out of being goyim, the kind of gentiles Jesus references in Matthew 18:17 who behave according to the teachings of the Nicolaitans, Balaam, and Jezebel. We are called to be Righteous Gentiles, grafted in and not trying to attain power over the nations. One of our rewards for this is being given the authority to judge the goyim in the age to come. This may not sound that thrilling but note that it is important enough to God that He mentions it several times, including Psalms 2 and here in the letter to Thyatira.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morning star&lt;/strong&gt;. Some commentators connect 2 Peter 1:19; however, a different Greek word is used in Revelation 2:28. Jesus states that He is the bring morning start in Revelation 22:16. Lizorkin references an apocryphal work, Sirach 50:5-7, and concludes the intended meaning is a &amp;ldquo;promise (to the overcomer) of a glorious future and great good yet to come. They will share it &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; Christ Himself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Keener adds, &amp;ldquo;the morning star, Venus, heralded the dawn and was a symbol of sovereignty among the Romans. To be given authority was to share Christ&amp;rsquo;s rule over creation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/4bbf31036991cf50e76bfb03a6588de1.jpeg&#34; cap=&#34;Jezabel and Ahab Meeting Elijah in Naboth&#39;s Vineyard Giclee. Print by Sir Frank Dicksee.&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;We focus on Jezebel because that certainly grabs our attention. It&amp;rsquo;s slightly cryptic, so we want to do our homework as best as possible and make sure we understand. However, the critical verses for Believers are not necessarily 20-29, but verse 19. If we want to please our Master, we need to exhibit good deeds and be known for our love, faith, service, patient endurance. Further, no matter how well we may be doing these things today, there will be another opportunity to do better tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toleration is the world&amp;rsquo;s philosophy, not God&amp;rsquo;s. We need to remember Galatians 1:8: But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck Missler paraphrased the famous expression (probably incorrectly) attributed to St. Augustine: &amp;ldquo;In essentials, unity; in non-essentials, liberty; in all things, agape.&amp;rdquo; We need to hold fast to the truth of God&amp;rsquo;s word and never allow it to be mixed in with non-biblical philosophies. We must always do so in love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;church-age-theory-thyatiraroman-church&#34;&gt;Church age theory: Thyatira=Roman Church&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/599819d1749ed236d0f257e50963e0c9.png&#34; cap=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the promise to hold until He returns that occurs in the last for letters, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea are seen all in existence today. The statement that &amp;ldquo;he who has an ear&amp;rdquo; is now after the promise to the overcomer also hints that there is something different about the last four compared to the first three churches. There is another variation that would hold that All seven churches have always been present, but one type of church has dominated in its given time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first universal pope was named in 606, so that is the date many commentators list as the start of the Thyatirian church age. Essentially this is the medieval church, which as we know was dominated by the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Missler says, &amp;ldquo;Protestant commentators have a field day linking Thyatira to the Catholic Church.&amp;rdquo; The history of the Catholic church has been bloody, and several Popes have been some of the most corrupt and morally depraved world leaders that history has ever witnessed &amp;ndash; much like Jezebel herself. Everything they did was all in the name of &amp;ldquo;Christ.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/b046f1d15cef93cacfc0f6c1c94e35d1.png&#34; cap=&#34;Denarius depicting Julius Caesar as pontifex maximum&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of the Catholic church has been bloody, and several Popes have been some of the most corrupt and morally depraved world leaders history has ever witnessed. Critics see the worship of Mary as a connection to the pagan &amp;ldquo;queen of heaven&amp;rdquo; that started back in the Babylonian days. The Pope is known as &amp;ldquo;Pontifex Maximus&amp;rdquo;, which were titles deified emperors such as Augustus in the Roman Cult. To be fair, in the Greek Old Testament, the equivalent term is used to describe the Jewish High Priest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/37ad82b2168894efb65d6f1751c64575.jpg&#34; cap=&#34;Statue of Peter at Capernaum&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protestants would say there is also a lack of biblical support for Peter as the first pope. There is no historical evidence that Peter was ever a Bishop of Rome and Peter&amp;rsquo;s own words counter any such political office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Pe 5:1-3 So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the glory that is going to be revealed: (2) shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you; not for shameful gain, but eagerly; (3) not domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler notes that there was a Babylonian priest &amp;ldquo;who interpreted the esoteric doctrines of the Babylonian mysteries called Peter, meaning the interpreter. He wore an insignia of two keys of Janus and Cybele, which still appear on the Papal arms as symbols of spiritual authority.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:21&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Janus is where we get the name of the first month of the year. As we tend to do in January, he is depicted as having two heads (looking forward and looking back). In fairness, Catholics would say these represent the symbolic &amp;ldquo;keys to the kingdom&amp;rdquo; given to Peter at Caesarea Philippi. This photo was taken at Peter’s hometown in Capernaum. Bolen writes, &amp;ldquo;with the property now owned by the Franciscans, it is not surprising that they would honor this apostle with a statue showing him holding a key and a staff.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:22&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 21, 1995, the Pope asked forgiveness for all wrongs and crimes committed and permitted by the Catholic Church throughout history. Many Catholic leaders will have a lot to answer for, both historically and in our times today. But you know what? Regardless of their religious affiliation (or lack thereof), all people will have to answer for their decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this said, Catholics and Protestants need not be enemies. One of my very best friends is Catholic, and we&amp;rsquo;re both confident we&amp;rsquo;ll both be together in the age to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/edcc1ea14f5b0e9b312b1f39bc569811.jpeg&#34; cap=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is said that Secret Service agents are trained to spot counterfeit currency, not by studying all the possible iterations of fake bills, but by intimately studying a legitimate bill. Every fiber, every mark (seen and unseen), every dot. I&amp;rsquo;m told they spend hours handling the real thing so that when they come across a fake bill, it&amp;rsquo;s pronounced as night and day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked this as a lesson for believers. The best way to spot a Jezebel with counterfeit beliefs is not by devoting our lives to studying everything wrong with that particular system. Leave that work to historians. The best way to spot the results of a Jezebel is to be intimately familiar with the truth. The word of God. I want it to be said of me what Paul said in acts 20:27: &amp;ldquo;for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, Protestants can&amp;rsquo;t get too smug about Thyatira. The letter representing the Protestant Reformation is Sardis and Jesus had NOTHING good to say about Sardis. In contrast, Thyatira receives the longest positives of all seven letters. The Catholic Church has done much good for humanity over the centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;parables-thyatira--mustard-seed-mat-1333&#34;&gt;Parables: Thyatira = Mustard Seed (Mat 13:33)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mat 13:33 And he told them yet another parable. &amp;ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with a bushel of flour, then waited until the whole batch of dough rose.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaven
:Usually, though not always, it represents sin or evil. &lt;strong&gt;1 Co 5:6&lt;/strong&gt; Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bushel/three measures of flour
:From Genesis 18:6, a fellowship meal, by extension the grain offering. According to Leviticus 2, grain offerings are supposed to be unleavened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till all was leavened
:The leaven corrupted the whole batch, which was supposed to remain unleavened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Meaning&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;In the Mustard Seed parable, the birds of the air nested, representing an external threat. The corruption came from within the dough itself in the Woman with Leaven. Missler finds it conspicuous that this is the only one of the seven parables that mentions a woman, and the letter to Thyatira also is the only one that mentions a woman. Jezebel was an internal threat that introduced corruption.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;paul-thyatiragalatians&#34;&gt;Paul: Thyatira=Galatians&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thyatira was the church that mixed the woman&amp;rsquo;s leaven, Jezebel&amp;rsquo;s false and pagan practices, with the true gospel. Paul admonishes the Galatians for the same things in the letter to the Galatians. He also uses the term &amp;ldquo;leaven&amp;rdquo; to describe this phenomenon in Galatians 5:9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some misconceptions arise when we fail to read Galatians as a Jewish book. Paul was a Jew writing to a predominately Jewish congregation, which had just begun to have Gentiles come to faith. If we read it as a gentile author writing to Gentile believers, we can get the impression that Paul is anti-Jewish. God forbid!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important to remember what legalism is and is not. Legalism is the doing of good deeds to merit salvation from God. A Judaizer says that a gentile must convert to and follow the Jewish law to earn salvation from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very different from doing good deeds as a thank you back to God. We can use the example of Messianic Jews. I have another good friend who absolutely knows he is saved by faith in Yeshua. Yet because he is Jewish, he observes Shabbat, keeps kosher, and observes the Jewish holidays instead of the Christian ones. He is not being legalistic. This is not being a Judaizer. In contrast, certain churches (Catholic as well as protestant) teach that believing in Jesus is not enough. One needs to do other things to get saved. This is what Galatians is focusing on, as Stern says, &amp;ldquo;the perversion of the Torah into a legalistic system.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:23&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:23&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
Gal 1:6-10 I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel— (7) not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. (8) But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. (9) As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed. (10) For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ.
&lt;p&gt;Gal 2:16 yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gal 3:1-3 O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified. (2) Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith? (3) Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gal 3:11 Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for “The righteous shall live by faith.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gal 5:9 A little leaven leavens the whole lump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gal 5:19-25 Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, (20) idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, (21) envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. (22) But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, (23) gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. (24) And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. (25) If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeshua is IN JERUSALEM, the holy city, for the Passover festival and remains in Judea for a few extra weeks while His disciples immerse new penitents. Meanwhile, John the Immerser moves his work into Samaria and begins immersing “at Aenon near Salim,” leaving Yeshua and His followers to baptize in the area around Jerusalem. Salim is a fertile valley in Samaria east of Shechem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “First” Passover&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “First” overturning of the tables&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick at Night&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 3:16&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many scholars believe John is recording separate accounts from the synoptic gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) while others contend John is interweaving the same events and is not necessarily interested in following a strict chronology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem with treating them each as separate is that we would end up with Jesus celebrating five or six Passovers during the time of his public ministry. You can’t fit more than four Passovers in a 3-year public ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, if Jesus drove out the profiteers one year, it’s easy to see they would be right back at it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reasons we have discussed I tend to believe Luke follows a strict chronology, but whichever view you hold on this I would recommend not holding on to it too tightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, focus on what each gospel writer is trying to communicate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:5.30217in;height:7.5in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended last lesson with the wedding at Cana (box 4) and Jesus spending a few days in Capernaum. Now, an unknown amout of time has passed and the next major event John records is the “first” Passover in Jerusalem, represented as event #5 according to Schlaegel , who views John’s recount of the temple cleansing as a separate event from the cleansing at Jesus’ final Passover as recorded in the synoptic Gospels. The counter-argument is that John is not as interested in chronology and could be placing the later event here for his own purposes. There are very smart people on both sides of the argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-213-17--the-passover-of-the-ioudaioi&#34;&gt;John 2:13-17 – The Passover of the Ioudaioi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.50311in;height:4.35in&#34; alt=&#34;C:\Users\Public\_Bethany\john2plus\Samaritan Passover, courtyard with men, tb043007194.jpg&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 The Passover of the Ioudaioi was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eli believes John specifies the Passover of the Ioudaioi to differentiate from the Passover of the Shomrim, the Samaritans because John has the Samaritans as one of his intended audiences. The Qumranites also held their own Passover according to their own calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samaritans are still around today and continue to celebrate a biblical Passover in much the same way that they have for more than two thousand years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the temple in Jerusalem does not exist, Jews do not practice animal sacrifice and thus the closest we can get to the practices of the first century is at the Samaritan celebration each year on Mount Gerizim.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a Jewish audience, and even to most gentiles, it would not be necessary to specify that it was a Jewish Passover; he could have just said “Passover.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.875in&#34; alt=&#34;C:\PLBL\03 Jerusalem\Southern Temple Mount Excavations\Shops underneath staircase of Robinson&amp;#39;s Arch, tb020101216.jpg&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money-changers sitting there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 And making a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and oxen. And he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 And he told those who sold the pigeons, “Take these things away; do not make my Father&amp;rsquo;s house a house of trade.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17 His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archaeologists have discovered shops built outside the Temple Mount on both the western and southern walls. Jesus presumably had no objection to these. What He took offense with was the commercial activity that had invaded the places intended for worship on the Temple Mount itself. tb020101216&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shops occupied the space underneath the monumental staircase that passed over Robinson’s Arch to provide access to the temple courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also that the things the people were selling were necessary for the Passover procedures at the temple and the money changers served an entirely practical purpose. Keener notes that money changers were needed to standardize the various foreign currencies of the pilgrims so the local sellers didn’t have to worry about “exchange rates” if I can use that term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can surmise that just like today a tourist can get swindled with an unfair exchange rate and a merchant can overcharge the unsuspecting, the same thing must have been happening at the temple. Dishonest money changers and merchants were profiteering at the expense of God’s faithful, likely in collusion with each other. Today that is called racketeering and is very much frowned upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked a little about whether this cleansing is the same as the one the synoptic gospels record at the end of Jesus’ ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately we recommend to not focus on whether this was the same or different events but focus on what each gospel is teaching us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eli notes that the quote John uses “Zeal for your house will consume me” is different from the quote the synoptic writers use, “my house shall be called a prayer for all nations, but you have made it a robber’s den.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John has in view an issue of purity whereas the synoptics appear to have a concern for the negative impression the spectacle of buying and selling has on the Gentiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eli sees John as providing evidence that the temple is unfit for proper worship because it is being controlled by apostates. It needed to be cleansed of this impurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.32222in&#34; alt=&#34;C:\Users\Public\_Bethany\john2plus\Fallen stones from Temple Mount destruction, tb090705034.jpg&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18 So the Ioudaioi said to him, “What sign do you show us for doing these things?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19 Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 The Ioudaioi then said, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21 But he was speaking about the temple of his body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning of Ioudaioi here is different than the meaning in verse 13. Before it referd to all jews or a Jewish religious observance in contrast to some other religious observance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, it appears to mean a few representatives of the Sadducean temple authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reasons we can only speculate, John never uses the term Saducee (this is a big clue that the first part of John 8, while historically accurate, was not written by John. It appears to be a later scribal insertion.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharisees were not in charge of the temple and, assuming this is early in Jesus’ ministry, Pharisees were similarly interested in the purity of worship and probably agreed with Jesus’ actions here (though they were unlikely to admit it publicly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few points where we might be tempted to place the wrong emphasis in a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We probably read this as, “what SIGNS do you show us for doing these things?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More likely it should be, “what signs do you SHOW US for doing these things?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sadducees thought they were the authority; one of John’s themes is the Sadducees are the usurpers – Jesus is the rightful authority no matter what the Sadducees think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photo: Archaeologists excavated this area in the 1990s and left these stones in place as a testimony to the Roman destruction in AD 70. Archaeologists have estimated that if all the Herodian stones which are in secondary use around Jerusalem were gathered together, almost the entire height of the Temple Mount walls could be reconstructed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While here, Jesus wasn’t necessarily predicting the destruction of the Literal Temple, in Luke 21 Jesus does exactly this. He says “not one stone will be left upon another” – today you can visit the southwest corner at the base of the temple mount and see that this prophecy was not only fulfilled, but literally fulfilled. Not one stone was left upon another&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tb090705034&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22 When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many believed in his name when they saw the signs that he was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24 But Jesus on his part did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25 and needed no one to bear witness about man, for he himself knew what was in man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Jesus is perfect, He is perfectly compassionate. He didn’t just heal for the sake of healing; he performed these miraculous acts as acts of compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster: “In Jewish thought a person’s name conveys authority. To believe on the name of Yeshua is to accept His authority as an Agent of God. They believed Him to be the promised Messiah”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 24 reads strange to us, “He did not need anyone’s testimony about a person because he knew what was within a person, or some translations have “within the heart of man.” This could be another way of saying that he told others to not tell anyone. He does not need man’s testimony and in fact preferred to keep a low profile for a number of reasons. He did not want to be seen as one who wanted to attract big crowds, though ultimately big crowds are exactly what happened. He also did not want to attract the attention of the establishment and roman authorities prematurely. He was not fomenting a revolution. He will say repeatedly that “my hour has not yet come.”. We can see the traps of fame very clearly today. People latch on to powerful and influential people for their own ulterior motives. Jesus wanted no part of such people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John is also attesting to Jesus’ divinity. Just as with Nethaniel under the fig tree, Jesus knows what is in man’s hearts – things only God can know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 3:1-35&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother&amp;rsquo;s womb and be born?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 Nicodemus said to him, “How can these things be?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 Jesus answered him, “Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen, but you do not receive our testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be our final lesson on what we refer to as the “pre-history” section of Genesis. This is a bit of a misnomer as we have plenty of history, but the end of chapter 11 marks a (perhaps THE) major turning point in the book. In chapter 12, the attention shifts to one man, Abraham, and the rest of the Bible will be about Abraham’s descendants and heirs by adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10 and 11 are best read as a single narrative. It’s a genealogy of Noah’s three sons, with specific “interruptions” to let the reader know of noteworthy details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:1 Noah’s genealogy begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:8-12 – an interruption in the genealogy for details on Nimrod&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:18-19- an interruption to provide details on the Canaanites&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:21 – interruption to remind the reader that Shem is the father of Eber, several generations later (Shem, Arphaxad, Salah, Eber)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:25 – interruption to tell us the earth was divided in the days of Peleg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:30 – interruption to tell us the borders of Joktan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:1-9 – interruption to tell us about the Tower of Babel incident&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:27 – the genealogy of Shem concludes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:28-32 – Transition to Abram’s narrative and segue to chapter 12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-101-noahs-three-sons&#34;&gt;Gen 10:1 Noah’s three sons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VERY IMPORTANT: As Walton says in his commentary, “there is no attempt (in the text) to link these peoples to racial divisions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse five tells us the focus is describing the peoples in terms of language, clan (family groups), and nationality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10 is called the table of nations (not the table of races); divisions along race are just that, divisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know who it is who likes to keep us divided. Satan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all one race, that of Noah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even to say this is a division among “ethnicities” becomes a problem because as the centuries pass, the ethnic lines become intermingled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I like the word “clan” as the ESV uses in verse 5. A tribe or nation as used by Native Americans is also a good mental picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These names aren’t races or ethnicities as much as they are family groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today people who appear to be white Europeans can actually be members of the Choctaw or Cherokee nation by virtue of family connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For another example, my last name is “Flanagan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this is a distinctively Irish surname, it would be an error to look at my last name and conclude I’m 100% Irish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would also be an error to look at my last name and assume my nation is Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people marry and move, things change over time, but the male’s family name (usually) stays the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could rightfully join the Clan of Flanagan by virtue of my name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible’s focus is on the clans of the Ancient Near East: northern Africa, Syria-Palestine, and Mesopotamia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take it on faith that the other people groups (east and south Asia, Europe, southern Africa, indigenous peoples of north and south America) came from one of the descendants of Shem, Ham, or Japheth, or perhaps a co-mingling; but, these peoples are not enumerated in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Divine Narrator/Author lists 70 names here; this will be later contrasted against the number of Jacob’s family that will enter Egypt in Gen 46.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of these names may be the names of tribes or nations rather than specific individuals – we can’t know for sure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From these and other references (such as the 70 elders in Exodus 24), 70 is said to be symbolic of totality or depending on the context, the totality of the &lt;em&gt;gentile&lt;/em&gt; nations (with 12 later becoming the number of Israel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, the word “goyim” means both “nations” and “gentiles”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we go through the Bible, we’ll find that Israel is not one of the nations; Israel is to be set apart from the gentile nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.64375in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.33333in;height:4.43056in&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-102-5-the-line-of-japheth&#34;&gt;Gen 10:2-5: The Line of Japheth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. The sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. From these the coastland peoples spread in their lands, &lt;strong&gt;each with his own language, by their clans, in their nations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on what we know, the descendants listed of Japheth do not share contiguous land borders but are connected on the basis of being by the sea.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verse 5 “coastland peoples” (ESV), or “maritime peoples” (NIV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the biblical stage unfolds, we will see the main conflict is primarily going to be between the peoples of Ham and Shem. We might think of Japheth as seated in the audience around the stage taking it all in (for the most part):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the map, Asia Minor (Tubal, Meshech, and Togarmah = Turkey), the Greek Islands, Cyprus, The steppes of Russia (along the Black Sea), Persia (Afghanistan, Iran), although Elam which is usually associated with Persia is listed under Shem. Madai = Medes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some suggest “Riphath” and “Europe” are linguistically connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarshish is the one that puzzles scholars&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibly along the west coast of Turkey, at least at one time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city is referenced many times in the Old Testament&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is arguably most famous for being the intended destination of Jonah; when he was told to preach in Ninevah, he wanted to go in the opposite direction as far away as possible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Turkish city up the coast from Joppa in the same general direction as Ninevah doesn’t fit the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some suggest Tarshish is related to a word for “tin,” which makes some people think of Britain (or perhaps Britain by way of Spain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Don’t confuse Tarshish with Tarsus, the name of Paul the Apostle’s home town)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashkenaz is another curious name as it later comes to denote European Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may hear the term, “Ashkenazi Jews”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jews, being a Semitic people, come from Shem, not Japheth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name probably came from the fact that there were Jews from Shem in the European lands once settled by Ashkenaz from Japheth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Jews in America are Ashkenazi because their fathers and grandfathers came from Europe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jews from Spain or Africa are typically “Sephardic Jews”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-106-20-the-line-of-ham&#34;&gt;Gen 10:6-20 The Line of Ham&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sons of Ham: Cush, Mitzraim, Put, and Canaan. The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where was Japheth spread far and wide, Ham stayed close by – Egypt and northern/eastern Africa, Arabia, Mesopotamia, and Syro-Palestine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitzraim is a somewhat unusual Hebrew dual form – perhaps in reference to upper (southern) and lower (northern) Egypt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gen-108-12-nimrod-and-babylon&#34;&gt;Gen 10:8-12 Nimrod and Babylon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cush fathered Nimrod; he was the first on earth to be a mighty man. He was a mighty hunter before the LORD. Therefore it is said, “Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD.” The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. From that land he went into Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah, and Resen between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brief narratives are unusual for ancient genealogies; however, these all focus on people and land areas that will later be significant (Babylon, Ninevah, Sidon, Sodom).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also the verb changes in verse 8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually in Chapter 10: “the sons of … were…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:8, 13, 15, 21, 25-26: “… begat/fathered …” – a clue that something is changing with this guy Nimrod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, when the Hebrew word for “begat” is used with Ham, these are the tribes/families designated for cursing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When “begat” is used with Shem, those descendants receive blessings, which will begin in Genesis chapter 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck Missler sums up Nimrod:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nimrod was responsible for the Tower of Babel. It was he who attempted to bring together the human race after the Flood in an effort to get them united into a nation in which he could become the great world ruler. He was the rebel, the founder of Babel, and the hunter of the souls of men. He was the lawless one, and he is a shadow or a type of the last world ruler, the Antichrist who is yet to appear. The first great civilization, therefore, came out from the sons of Ham. – Chuck Missler&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nimrod “before” the LORD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word for “before” is liphnei and it literally means “in the face of” the LORD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can have a plain rendering of before the LORD, like you and I might show some important person the proper degree of respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also have a nuanced meaning, the way we think of it when we say someone got in the face of someone else&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most conservative translators render this with a nuanced meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Christian Hebrew linguist Franz Delitzsch says this: “Nimrod was mighty in hunting, and that in opposition to (the LORD) not &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; in the sense of according to the purpose and the will of (the LORD), (which is) irreconcilable with the context. The name Nimrod, from &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;מָרַד&lt;/span&gt;, “we will revolt,” points to some violent resistance to God.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditions involving Nimrod:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the originator of idolatry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the first world-dictator&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nimrod begat the line of the Pharohs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the builder of the Tower of Babel (Bab-El gateway to G/god)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pagan tradition even ascribes to him supernatural beginnings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know he founded Babylon and we can infer he had a kingdom of some significance, but the Author doesn’t tell us who spearheaded the Babel building project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding his divinity, according to the Bible, “Nimrod is clearly a human hero rather than divine or semi-divine.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster writes, “Just as we regard Abraham as the father of our faith, we can regard Nimrod as the father of idolatry.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Walton, the description given in verses 8-12 “corresponds to the growth of the first known empire in history, the dynasty of Agade ruled by Sargon (about 2300 BC). Nimrod’s kingdom included Erech, the city where Gilgamesh reigned and one of the oldest and greatest centers of Sumerian culture.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gen-1013-20-mitzraiym-egypt&#34;&gt;Gen 10:13-20 Mitzraiym (Egypt)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitzraiym &lt;strong&gt;fathered&lt;/strong&gt; Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, Pathrusim, Casluhim (from whom the Philistines came), and Caphtorim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In some manuscripts, the Philistines are listed separately; the ESV here follows the majority opinion that the Philistines came from Casluhim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gen-1015-18-canaan-and-the-ites&#34;&gt;Gen 10:15-18 Canaan and the “ites”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canaan fathered Sidon his firstborn and Heth, and the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. &lt;strong&gt;Afterward the clans of the Canaanites dispersed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heth probably refers to Hittites, a formidable empire from 1600-700 BCE with it’s principal city Carchemish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Esau would later marry into the tribe of Hittites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some link the “Sinites” to far-east Asia (sino- is a prefix meaning China)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently there was a lot of inter-mingling of Canaan after they dispersed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canaanites later become &lt;em&gt;ethnically&lt;/em&gt; identified as Semitic peoples, but here the origin is the family of Canaan from Ham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the Jebusites, as they will be the ones in control over Jerusalem at the time of Saul and David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidon is loosely synonymous with Lebanon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, geographic boundaries and names change over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gen-1019-20-canaanite-boundaries&#34;&gt;Gen 10:19-20: Canaanite Boundaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the territory of the Canaanites extended from Sidon in the direction of Gerar as far as Gaza, and in the direction of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. These are the sons of Ham, by their clans, their languages, their lands, and their nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-1021-32-shem--abrahams-line&#34;&gt;Gen 10:21-32 Shem – Abraham’s Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gen-1021-22&#34;&gt;Gen 10:21-22&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shem goes last because he’s the one the Author wants us to focus on and remember.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To &lt;strong&gt;Shem&lt;/strong&gt; also, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, children were born. The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, &lt;strong&gt;Arpachshad&lt;/strong&gt;, Lud, and Aram. The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The father of the children of Eber” is the author’s way of saying, “Head’s up; this is YOUR ancestral line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Hebrew” and “Eber” are linguistically related.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are big-time players on the world stage: Elam = Persia/Iran; Asshur = Assyria; Aram = Arameans&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asshur was the capital of Assyria from 2025-879 BCE (If you’re wondering about the answer to a trivia question posed in a certain Monty python movie. Although the bridge keeper asked, “what IS the capital of Assyria?” In AD 932, Assyria ceased to exist. It sounds like a trick question all the way around. Not that it mattered to Brave Sir Robin.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll bold Abraham’s forefathers (see also Luke 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gen-1024-25-arphaxad&#34;&gt;Gen 10:24-25: Arphaxad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arpachshad fathered &lt;strong&gt;Shelah&lt;/strong&gt;; and Shelah fathered &lt;strong&gt;Eber&lt;/strong&gt;. To Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was &lt;strong&gt;Peleg&lt;/strong&gt;, for in his days the earth was divided, and his brother&amp;rsquo;s name was Joktan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “days when the earth was divided” is often assumed to be a reference to the Tower of Babel incident, but we aren’t told this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It potentially could reference some other significant event such as famine before the Tower that triggered a drastic migration of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this event is referenced in Genesis 11:2: “And as people migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gen-1026-31-joktan&#34;&gt;Gen 10:26-31: Joktan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;26 Joktan fathered Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, Obal, Abimael, Sheba, Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan. The territory in which they lived extended from Mesha in the direction of Sephar to the hill country of the east. These are the sons of Shem, by their clans, their languages, their lands, and their nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheba&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determining people groups is further complicated by the fact that more than one person had the name “Sheba,” who is also mentioned as a son of Ham in verse 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheba (and Dedan, a son of Ham) are generally considered associated with the Arabian peninsula, as are Ophir and Havilah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some suggest the two Shebas are the same person because of intermingling between the tribes of Shem and Ham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arabs are very much Semitic peoples as they are not just sons of Shem, but sons of Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gen-1032-conclusion&#34;&gt;Gen 10:32 Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the clans of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies, in their nations, and from these the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Author reminds His readers that all families came from Noah, but we get more detail on those families that were of unique interest to Israel by using the word “begat” instead of “the sons of…”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-111-9-the-tower-of-babel&#34;&gt;Gen 11:1-9: The Tower of Babel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Now the whole earth had one language and the same words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:5.27986in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the names in the genealogies, many scholars conclude the one language was likely Hebrew. The names listed in Genesis 5, 10, and 11 all have meaning in Hebrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Walton, “Many features of this account point to the end of the fourth millennium (~3000 BCE) as the setting of the narrative.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2-4 And as people migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. And they said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shinar is in the lower region of the Tigris-Euphrates basin, possibly equivalent to ancient “Sumer.” Ur was one of the principal cities in this area but there was also an Ur much further up river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they say “lest we be scattered” they probably are not thinking of a judgment directly, but likely the life of a nomad, moving from place to place to survive in response to drought, flooding or famine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing people to live closer to an urban area would be something that prevents scattering. All the necessary services, including religious temples, would be nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People living in proximity would enable economies of scale such as “large-scale irrigation and excess grain production.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at it is through urbanization people didn’t need to rely on the gods to meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The life of Abraham will be the opposite of this. Abraham is frequently on the move, relying on God to direct his steps. Sometimes he succeeds and other times he fails. We’ll get to that in the next few lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While urbanization sounds practical, we are reminded that God’s instructions were to multiply and fill the earth, not congregate in one location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In English, it might be easy to come away thinking, “they wanted to build a tall building. What’s the problem with that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s response makes it clear this was a religious temple built as act of pride and arrogance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take the traditions and legends about Nimrod and combine them with the biblical text that tells us he was in defiance of the Lord, we can presume Nimrod founded a dictatorship that was anti-God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They wanted to make a name for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the tower is a way of saying, “we can ascend to heaven on our own, without You, God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing they were afraid of is what came to pass – being dispersed over the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5-9 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of man had built. And the LORD said, “Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another&amp;rsquo;s speech.” So the LORD dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth. And from there the LORD dispersed them over the face of all the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a bit of a pun in “God came down to see”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ziggurat was built so the people could climb up to see the gods and, conversely, the gods could come down to see the people in order to bless them and be worshipped by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God came down alright but not in the way they were thinking. And I doubt he needed to take the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this point forward, Babylon represents those in opposition to the one true God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 13,14 and Jeremiah 50,51 talk about the doom and destruction of Babylon in terms “like Sodom and Gomorrah.” Revelation 17 and 18 tell us of Babylon’s final end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who rebel against God will be dispersed but God is longing to bring us together as one family. When He gathers us in, it will be on His terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.” (Mar 13:27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;love-your-neighbor-be-interpersonal-bereans&#34;&gt;Love Your Neighbor: Be Interpersonal Bereans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We should not condemn people without a proper investigation.” – Rabbi Pliskin&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God, of course, did not need to come down from Heaven to see the wickedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pliskin notes that the Bible describes God’s personal investigation into the Tower of Babel matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was to teach us that we should not condemn based on hearsay or circumstantial evidence, but form conclusions based only on what we can prove. “We must view a person favorably unless we have carefully investigated the matter and have established beyond a doubt that he is guilty.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We focus on being Bereans when it comes to Bible study. We need to be Bereans with each other as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give others the benefit of the doubt unless you also “came down to see” it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I, therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.” (Eph 4:1-3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;babylon-vs-jerusalem&#34;&gt;Babylon vs. Jerusalem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler often quips that the Bible is a tale of two cities, Jerusalem and Babylon, and here we see the beginning of Babylon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know from our Revelation study that Babylon will be the center of the kingdom that rises in opposition to God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether this is literal Babylon on the banks of the Euphrates, or a spiritual Babylon on the banks of the literal Thames, Hudson, or Potomac, or somewhere else we aren’t sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, Revelation depicts the person we know as the Antichrist ruling Babylon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the combination of what we know from the Bible and taking into account the tradition, it makes sense to consider Nimrod a foreshadowing of the Antichrist figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and Last world dictators&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babylon rises and falls&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mankind rises in defiance of the LORD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also references in Isaiah 10, 14, and Micah 5 to “The Assyrian” and this becomes another name for the Antichrist. What was the capital of Assyria when the prophets were writing? Ninevah (705-612 BCE). Who founded Ninevah? Nimrod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-1110-26-shems-descendants-to-abraham&#34;&gt;Gen 11:10-26 Shem’s descendants to Abraham&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the generations of Shem. When Shem was 100 years old, he fathered Arpachshad two years after the flood. And Shem lived after he fathered Arpachshad 500 years and had other sons and daughters. When Arpachshad had lived 35 years, he fathered Shelah. And Arpachshad lived after he fathered Shelah 403 years and had other sons and daughters. When Shelah had lived 30 years, he fathered Eber. And Shelah lived after he fathered Eber 403 years and had other sons and daughters. When Eber had lived 34 years, he fathered Peleg. And Eber lived after he fathered Peleg 430 years and had other sons and daughters. When Peleg had lived 30 years, he fathered Reu. And Peleg lived after he fathered Reu 209 years and had other sons and daughters. When Reu had lived 32 years, he fathered Serug. And Reu lived after he fathered Serug 207 years and had other sons and daughters. When Serug had lived 30 years, he fathered Nahor. And Serug lived after he fathered Nahor 200 years and had other sons and daughters. When Nahor had lived 29 years, he fathered Terah. And Nahor lived after he fathered Terah 119 years and had other sons and daughters. When Terah had lived 70 years, he fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Narrator is gradually drawing us in from all the families on the earth, to one family: Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list gets a little murky as we have a Nahor named after his grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In describing Jesus’ line through Abraham and back to Adam, Luke 3:36 mysteriously adds a “Cainan” between Shelah and Arphaxad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be a copyists error&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is noteworthy that when Hebrew says “the father of”, it doesn’t have to mean the person of the immediately preceding generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grandfathers and great-great-great grandfathers could all be said to be the father of someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-1127-28-terahs-line&#34;&gt;Gen 11:27-28 Terah’s line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27 Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran fathered Lot. Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his kindred, in Ur of the Chaldeans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two candidates for Ur, which is where Abram lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton notes that at the time of the setting of the story the Chaldeans were settled primarily in northern Mesopotamia. This Ur is not far from Haran and is possibly slightly more likely as the trip between the two cities is more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another reference to Abraham’s home is “Paddan Aram,” which would line up with a northern location of Ur.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on when this was written, the Chaldeans had migrated south, and in fact, Chaldea becomes a synonym of Babylon (Jeremiah 50:10, 51:24, and particularly Ezekiel 23:15: “…a likeness of Babylonians whose native land was Chaldea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the southern Ur was a famous Sumerian city, Walton speculates that “Ur of the Chaldees” is possibly the northern city, since the southern city would have just been known as “Ur.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upper map is from the Satellite Bible Atlas, where Dr. Schlaegel holds to the southern Ur location.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower map is from the Moody Bible Atlas, where Dr. Beitzel holds to a norther Ur location.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good scholars can disagree!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.png&#34; style=&#34;width:4.45767in;height:3.74526in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image5.png&#34; style=&#34;width:4.41475in;height:2.41255in&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Abram and Nahor took wives. The name of Abram&amp;rsquo;s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor&amp;rsquo;s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and Iscah. Now Sarai was barren; she had no child. Terah took Abram his son and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram&amp;rsquo;s wife, and they went forth together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the land of Canaan, but when they came to Haran, they settled there. The days of Terah were 205 years, and Terah died in Haran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nahor is going to be a name to remember since he turns out to be the grandfather of Rebekah and Laban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebekah will marry Abraham’s son Isaac&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laban has two daughters Rachael and Leah, who will marry Jacob and produce the 12 tribes; Laban will be a source of grief for Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is going to take place in Haram, or you might see the name “Padan Aram” which is the name of the general region around Haran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to think like an ancient – the narrative is flowing along with a list of names and them BOOM! We have a big problem. Sarai was barren; she had no child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram is supposed to be the hero yet for a moment it looks like his line will end. Also, since the command from God was to be fruitful and multiply, barrenness was seen as a judgment from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course they knew the rest of the story just as we do but the drama would have been palpable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 7 adds an interesting tidbit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis doesn’t tell us that it was GOD who told the family to set out from Ur of the chaldeans, but acts 7:2-3 says the Glory of God appeared to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is great example of how the old and new testaments are really one book&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also an aspect of Abraham from Acts that we can miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Acts, God told Abraham to go from Ur to the land of Canaan, yet Abraham stopped in Haran. Was this a lack of faith? Canaan is a long way away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gives new meaning to the word “settled”, which in English is a fantastic pun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They settled in harah, meaning they stopped and live there for a while&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also settled FOR haran, meaning God had more in store for Abraham but Abraham settled for something less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some commentators see 3:16-21 as John the apostle writing his own commentary in summation of the Nicodemus dialogue. Others see the passage as Jesus’ own words, continuing the dialogue with Nicodemus. I would favor these being Jesus’ words, but I can see why people think they might be John’s there are certainly some similarities to passages such as chapter 1, which we know are John’s writings. Ultimately, we would say John is inspired by the Holy Spirit so we can be confident John 3:16 is from the mouth of God, even if not spoken by Jesus to Nicodemus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we don’t want to do is view John 3:16-21 as a separate thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image26.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:3.6in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image27.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:6.73667in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image6.png&#34; style=&#34;width:0.4265in;height:0.42654in&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image30.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:3.6in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image23.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.40333in;height:4.11in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image31.png&#34; style=&#34;width:2.61in;height:2.57667in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image6.png&#34; style=&#34;width:0.4265in;height:0.42654in&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAD to return to Galilee through Samaria. Usually Jews would avoid Samaritans and take the way down the mountain through Jericho then head north along the Jordan. This time, Jesus is going to head due north along the way of the patriarchs, the &amp;lt;click&amp;gt; same road Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob traveled when they needed to go north/south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-314-16&#34;&gt;John 3:14-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image34.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:3.6in&#34; /&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is still answering Nicodemus’ question, “how can these things be?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Only Son” recalls Genesis 22 and Abraham’s near offering of Isaac, where Isaac is called Abraham’s “only” (or “unique”) son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 3:16 is famous precisely because of the fact it requires no additional insight or commentary to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Son of God expresses the true nature of Jesus eternal and essential being. He is the LOGOS made flesh, the Son has emanated forth from God.” That’s a quote from Lancaster’s commentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern notes that while Matthew presents Jesus as coming for the lost sheep of Israel, John emphasies that Jesus has come to Jews and Gentiles alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image35.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:3.6in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God loves His creation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gives His creation that which is most precious to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is God’s unique son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was fully aware that he would have to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eternal suffering is punishment not only for the inevitable consequence of sin, but now, in rejecting God’s provision for that sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the individual who trusts in Jesus, eternal life means not only in the future beyond the grave, but positive life now in Jesus – life more abundantly. – from David Stern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the Jewish concept of verbs is always tied to action. Belief is not mere intellectual acknowledgment, but a life that reflects a fundamental trust in and reliance on Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-317-18&#34;&gt;John 3:17-18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image39.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:3.6in&#34; /&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a debate about whether 3:16-21 is Jesus still speaking to Nicodemus or whether the conversation ends at 3:15, and 16-21 is John’s commentary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supporters of the later view note the similarity between this passage (verse 18 for example) and John 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either way, these words are powerful and for the most part, self-explanatory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note the tie-in to believing in His name in Chapter 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first-coming was not to bring judgment. That is handled the second coming – read the book of Revelation for more information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember this thought that he did not come to condemn when we get to the scene at the synagogue at Nazareth. Jesus is going to read from Isaiah 61 but He’s going to omit a line that turns out to be very telling in differentiating between the first and second comings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image40.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:7.11111in;height:4in&#34; /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;John (or Jesus) is continuing to contrast light versus dark, innocent vs guilty, saved vs John 3:18 condemned (based on faith, not lineage or works), righteous versus wicked,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Dead Sea scrolls also make these contrasts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This American Colony photograph was taken between 1900 and 1920.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mat02208&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-319&#34;&gt;John 3:19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image44.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:3.6in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is now compared to a light coming into the world, which certainly recalls Genesis 1:3-4. As we studied back in the first lesson, there are many parallels with John 1 and Genesis 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image45.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:7.11111in;height:4in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jesus’s day, the city would not have been as well-lit after dark. A quick Greek lesson – we often hear that the word “&lt;em&gt;agape&lt;/em&gt;” means God’s perfect love. Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives at night (from the east)o o Verse 19 reads, men &lt;em&gt;agapao&lt;/em&gt; the darkness&amp;hellip;because their deeds are evil. o It’s better to think of Agape as to be totally and completely given over to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you totally and completely given over to God, or do we give part to God but save part for the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Note the design:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passage begins with the dark heart (i.e. lies) of man and the meeting with Nicodemus is in the literal darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passage ends with the truth and light of God. o As a literary form, this type of bracketing is common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiritually, John’s point is the believer passes from death to life; from darkness to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to look at a verse like verse 19 and conclude that is only referring to people who reject God. Well, of course it is, but what we forget is that was you and me at one point. Our sin nature still agapao’s darkness rather than light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tb031505530b&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-320-21&#34;&gt;John 3:20-21&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image49.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:3.6in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For those who agapao darkness, the last thing they want is to have their deeds exposed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For disciples, who believe in the Son (John 3:16), this faith results in the believer moving into the light. Such belief is supposed to manifest in good deeds; thus the believer is unafraid to have the light expose righteous works.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John 3:36 reiterates this thought of obedience. “Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The church at learge today teaches, “just believe and you’re in”. As if our faith is all boiled down to acknowledging a certain set of facts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;True talmidim, Believe Him, walk with Him, and follow Him and OBEY him o Lancaster writes, “Belief in Him needs to result in repentance and turning towards God.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image50.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:7.11111in;height:4in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nicodemus came with questions. Perhaps he initially left with More questions but God rewards a heart that seeks after Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We know from John 7 and John 19 that Nicodemus was and is a believer. Despite his wealth and his status, His interview with Jesus changed His life forever. Nicodemus is one person I’m looking forward to meeting one day in the age to come.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mat14450h&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image52.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:3.6in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John’s imprisonment is reported in Mat 14:3-12 and Mark 6:17-29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is some speculation that John the gospel writer is the unnamed Jew.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image53.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:7.11111in;height:4in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hills in the distance belong to Gilead, in the modern country of Jordan. The ponds in the distance reflect the availability of water from springs here and are used for raising fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The themes of purification, living water, spirit are throughout the early chapters of John.John 3:23&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ch 1: waters of baptism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ch 2: stone jars of purification and cleansing/purifying of the temple o Ch 3: born of water and spirit and this discussion beginning with v. 22 o Ch 4: the Woman at the Well and the discussion of living water&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ch 5: the false waters of the Asklepion of Bethesda versus the One who can bring true restoration and purification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also references to purification by water in chapters 7, 9 13, and 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among many contrasts, John is pointing out that Jesus is the ceremonially pure one in contrast to the general world at large and the temple establishment in particular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tbs99019810&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-326&#34;&gt;John 3:26&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image57.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:3.6in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 4:2 is going to clarify that Jesus was not immersing but his talmidim were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image61.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:3.6in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John describes his role in the form of a parable o Bride: Israel o Groom: Messiah o Friend: John&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing the Bride to the Groom: John’s ministry of immersion and repentance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voice: Jesus’ call or Jesus going public with His ministry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning: “John’s role was only to prepare Israel for Messiah and then step aside.” (Lancaster, COM 247)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John did not want his own works to overshadow Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While John’s and possibly Jesus’ disciples were beginning to form a Jordan River Rivalry, John is uninterested in the dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is John NOT upset, he is joyful. Weddings are supposed to be joyful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lancaster suggests John is playing the role of Moses, who brings the bride (Israel) to meet the groom (God).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 30 is an important one for Talmidim. It’s not about us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we are ambassadors for Jesus, we put His interests first and ours second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walking In His Dust&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talmidim keep our eyes on God’s bigger picture.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ephesians 4:1-3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I therefore, a prisoner for the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which you have been called, with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all &lt;strong&gt;humility&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;gentleness&lt;/strong&gt;, with &lt;strong&gt;patience&lt;/strong&gt;, bearing with one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;another in &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt;, eager to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;maintain the &lt;strong&gt;unity&lt;/strong&gt; of the Spirit in the bond of peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first was when he allowed two of his disciples to switch teachers. The more we can keep our own pride and ego in check, the more the Light of Jesus can shine through us. The Ultimate goal is when people see us, they don’t see us, they see Jesus through us.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 15:47-49 The first man&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven. As was the man of dust, so also are those who are of the dust, and as is the man of heaven, so also are those who are of heaven. Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image6.png&#34; style=&#34;width:0.4265in;height:0.42654in&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John now moves into a discourse comparing the earthly man vs the heavenly man. Paul framed this in terms of the first Adam vs the last adam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image66.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:7.11111in;height:4in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image67.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:2.74036in;height:4.19443in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image68.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:3.21254in;height:2.40941in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image6.png&#34; style=&#34;width:0.47407in;height:0.47407in&#34; /&gt;Note the recurring themes of “witness,” “testimony,” and so forth. Discovered in Cave 4 of Qumran in the early 1950s, this text contains five biblical verses that focused on the coming of the Messiah. Cave 4 is the famous cave where many books of the Old Testament were found,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;including a complete copy of Isaiah.Dead Sea Scroll 4Q175 Testimonia (“Messianic Anthology”), 1st century BC John 3:32&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is another instance where John seemingly breaks off from quoting someone and adds his own commentary. This passage is a little clearer than John 3:16-21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 3:16 is clearly a continuation of the discussion with Nicodemus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, John is picking up the mystical discourse of the Preexistent One he established in Chapter 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’ve talked about before; John is focused with establishing (giving witness) to who Jesus is, whereas the other gospels focus on what jesus said, did and felt, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the synoptic gospels say “the kingdom of heaven is at hand,” John is going to say “Light has come into the world,” because “light” is who Jesus is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John 3:34-36&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image72.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:3.6in&#34; /&gt;Whoever receives his testimony sets his seal to this, that God is true. For he whom God has sent utters the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure. The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;John 10:29&lt;/sup&gt; My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father&#39;s hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 28:18 And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image6.png&#34; style=&#34;width:0.4265in;height:0.42654in&#34; /&gt;On wrath: Romans 1:182:8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seal = authentication, like a notary’s stamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take a passage such as “the spirit without measure” for granted, but it was not a simple topic in Jesus’ day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Psalm 51, David could pray, “take not your Spirit from me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have been sealed by the Spirit as described by the apostolic documents, we can NOT pray this prayer, nor would it ever occur to us to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Judaism of the day, only the righteous could merit the Spirit (in a grand sense, that is still true today).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the concept of authorization is present in John’s gospel. The Son is the fully authorized representative of the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For God to give the Spirit without measure would have been another seismic shift in their thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John, again stresses Jesus authority by saying the father has given all things &amp;lt;read references&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t read the Bible and come up with multiple ways to salvation. Either believe in the Son and have eternal life, or disobey and experience God’s wrath. I suppose that makes us narrow minded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;john-41-4-references&#34;&gt;John 4:1-4 References&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image73.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.4in;height:3.6in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image6.png&#34; style=&#34;width:0.4265in;height:0.42654in&#34; /&gt;Now when Jesus learned that the &lt;em&gt;Pharisees&lt;/em&gt; had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John (although Jesus himself did not baptize, but only his disciples), he left Judea and departed again for Galilee. And he had to pass through Samaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chapter breaks can be most unfortunate because we subconsciously view them as a scene shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John needs to be read in one sitting because everything ties together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Son, who is the Father’s authenticated representative, gives the Spirit without measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the Son, is going to widen the people’s narrow view of who is eligible to receive the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus popularity was growing, but Jesus was not ready to go full throttle with public ministry in Judea, so he makes a strategic retreat back to Galilee. This is one reason I tend to see the overturning of the tables as occurring at the end of Jesus’ ministry, but John places it early to tell his version of the story. It seems odd that Jesus would have make spectical in Jerusalem, not caring who he angered, but then retreated here not wanting a confrontation. I might be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth mentioning again that when John says “Pharisees” we need to remember that John uses this term very generically, to include herodians and sadducees as well as the party of the Pharisees. In other words, the whole religious establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need to look closely at the context to decide whether we have Pharisees or Sadducees in view. There is a big difference,” writes Lancaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like someone saying “the politicians” and we need to figure out whether they are liberal or conservative, corrupt or clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the Pharisees were all about having disciples and followers. They were all about the purity of the Law and as yet, Jesus had done nothing to arouse their suspicion. If overturning the tables had happened here, the Pharisees probably would have applauded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;26&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image74.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:7.11111in;height:4in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image75.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:5.97689in;height:4in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image76.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:2.96612in;height:4.19451in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image6.png&#34; style=&#34;width:0.47407in;height:0.47407in&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(1) &amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Sardis, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the one who has the sevenfold Spirit of God and the seven stars: &amp;ldquo;I know what you are doing—you have a reputation for being alive, but in fact you are dead!  (2) Wake up, and strengthen what remains, before it dies too! For I have found what you are doing incomplete in the sight of my God.  (3) So remember what you received and heard, and obey it, and turn from your sin! For if you don&amp;rsquo;t wake up, I will come like a thief; and you don&amp;rsquo;t know at what moment I will come upon you.  (4) Nevertheless, you do have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes; and they will walk with me, clothed in white, because they are worthy.  (5) He who wins the victory will, like them, be dressed in white clothing; and I will not blot his name out of the Book of Life; in fact, I will acknowledge him individually before my Father and before his angels.  (6) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.&amp;rdquo; &#39;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sardis-background&#34;&gt;Sardis Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/d06d305fb1dd0ae213f040e63dbaeead.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sardis is about 17 miles south of Thyatira and 60 miles east of Smyrna.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founding of Sardis likely dates to before the time of Abraham (c 2000 BCE). It was the ancient capital of the Lydian empire. Its patron deity was the Goddess Cybele, which in Greco-Roman times became Artemis/Diana, who was also the patron deity of Ephesus. Cybele&amp;rsquo;s son was Midas, whom we may know as the one where everything he touched turned to gold. This is a great lesson in the need to think things through. Everything he touched, included things such as food. Before the Greek period, Sardis was rumored to have &amp;ldquo;gold-bearing sands.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Historically, it was an extremely wealthy city all the way through New Testament times.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;img src=&#34;images/f19e90f43b6db3fa14d444c2d16c7b40.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temple to Diana was the fourth largest Ionic-style temple existing in the ancient world.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There were eight massive columns on each end with 20 columns on each side. One of these columns is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. For scale, note the people on the ground in the photo.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; At one point, prior to it being excavated by archaeologists, the entire temple was underground, with just the columns sticking up out of the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/c099e2a7ce04345047ade1d97b1b57e9.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Pergamum, ancient Sardis sat atop a hill rising 1000 feet from the valley below.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; By appearances, it was impregnable. Geologically, the cliffs were predominately clay, which cracked and eroded. Egotistically, the citizens referred to their city as &amp;ldquo;Sardis the Impregnable,&amp;rdquo; so did little to guard.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; One tradition holds that in 549 BCE, Cyrus was approaching with his Persian army. Only one person was designated to watch the one entrance up the cliff and that person fell asleep and dropped his helmet partway down the cliff. The Persians saw the man and the path he took were able to follow that same path to victory. Then in 214 BCE, a nearly identical thing happened. A man was asleep at his post, this time allowing Antiochus I and his Seleucid Greeks to take over. The city was conquered three other times during that period (501, 334, and 322). In the New Testament times, the city was devastated by a severe earthquake in 17 CE. We could say that they had a name that they were impenetrable but were very much vulnerable. Jesus appears to be drawing on this history when He says, &amp;ldquo;wake up!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;burial-place-of-gog&#34;&gt;Burial place of Gog?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight miles north of Sardis are dozens of these burial mounds (called tumulus) dating from the 8th-6th centuries BCE. This is the mound of Gyges, the first king of Lydia (687-652 BCE), thought by many to be the biblical Gog from Ezekiel 39-39&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We will meet Gog again in Revelation 20:8. &amp;ldquo;and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Thyatira, archeologists have been able to uncover many findings at Sardis. Most date from the 2nd century through the Byzantine period. Stiles reports that along a street where 27 shops have been excavated, 10 of these belonged to Christians, clearly indicating integration into mainstream society. This is in remarkable contrast to the previous four cities we have studied, where persecution was expected. The photo shows what archaeologists believe to be a paint shop. The slabs with the crosses inscribed was a water basin.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a large, well-preserved Jewish synagogue that could accommodate 1000 people. This attests to a significant Jewish/Christian population. Bolen writes, &amp;ldquo;The approximately eighty inscriptions found…reveal that many Jews held high positions, serving on the city council or as wealthy citizens of Sardis.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 100 years earlier, Sardis was one of the first cities in the Empire that upheld the rights of Jews to be exempt from Emperor worship, so it appears the Jews held special favor here. For Gentiles, such worship was enforced here as it was everywhere in the Empire, yet as we saw, gentile Christians appear to have been as integrated into Sardis&amp;rsquo;s society just as much as Jews were, and both groups were prosperous. Given this background, one of the dangers the letter to Sardis represents is apathy stemming from wealth and comfort. Keener states, &amp;ldquo;Despite the city&amp;rsquo;s paganism, the Christian community seems to have experienced no persecution—and hence no spiritual life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do have one bit of potentially good news to report on Sardis from a spiritual perspective. There is a large basilica that was built right next to the temple of Artemis, as a testament that the gospel outlasted the false gods of Rome.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Wayne stiles notes, &amp;ldquo;The ruins of this Christian building offer a model of hope of the Grace of God to all Christians who are struggling with compromise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Bolen adds, &amp;ldquo;Sardis remained a center of Christianity well into the 14th century.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As Jesus will tell the Laodiceans, &amp;ldquo;Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline, so be zealous and repent&amp;rdquo; (Rev 3:19). Perhaps the longevity of the Church in Sardis is evidence that the believers there heeded Jesus&amp;rsquo; warnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(1) &amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Sardis, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the one who has the sevenfold Spirit of God and the seven stars:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Joh 15:26-27 “But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me. (27) And you also will bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.  &lt;br&gt;1Pe 1:10-12 Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired carefully, (11) inquiring what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories. (12) It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you, in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look. &lt;br&gt; Zechariah 4:6 Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the LORD of hosts.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Thyatira, Sardis&amp;rsquo;s meaning is well known. We may be familiar with the &amp;ldquo;sardius stone.&amp;rdquo; This is what Sardis means. It is a reddish-yellow stone, which was the 1st stone on the 1st row of the breastplate of the high priest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus&amp;rsquo; description of himself (and remember the text does not directly tell us Jesus is talking; we infer it) is taken from chapter 1:20. He&amp;rsquo;s holding all the churches in his hand. Missler, who is a proponent of the church age theory sees a deeper connection. In this theory, Sardis speaks of the Protestant Reformation. Most Protestant churches tend to be uncomfortable with the Holy Spirit. We know He is there, but if we were asked to write a description of the duties of the spirit, most of us wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have much beyond &amp;ldquo;helper&amp;rdquo; (John 15:26). In fact, the topic of the Spirit is a cause of major division among Protestants. Conversely, there are some denominations who emphasize the spirit, perhaps to an excess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;zechariah-41-10&#34;&gt;Zechariah 4:1-10&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book of Zechariah, the prophet receives several visions, including the one in Chapter 4 about the rebuilding of the 2nd temple, which is often called &amp;ldquo;Zerubbabel&amp;rsquo;s temple.&amp;rdquo; Zerubbabel was the heir to the Davidic throne and served as governor of Judah under the Persian king Darius I. He was not truly a king but more of an administrator. Many people assume that the Davidic line was broken at the time of the Babylonian captivity. They would be correct in the sense of that&amp;rsquo;s when the Davidic kingship ended. Technically, the Davidic line continued upon the people&amp;rsquo;s return, albeit in a weakened state, after the Babylonian captivity. Based on passages like Zechariah 4, some assumed Zerubbabel would be the promised Messiah. This obviously was not to be, and the Davidic line &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; stop with Zerubbabel as the next administrator after him was not of the royal line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Zechariah 4:1-10: And the angel who talked with me came again and woke me, like a man who is awakened out of his sleep. (2) And he said to me, “What do you see?” I said, “I see, and behold, a &lt;strong&gt;lampstand all of gold, with a bowl&lt;/strong&gt; on the top of it, and &lt;strong&gt;seven lamps&lt;/strong&gt; on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it. (3) And there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.” (4) And I said to the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” (5) Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, “Do you not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.” (6) Then he said to me, “This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: &lt;strong&gt;Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the LORD of hosts&lt;/strong&gt;. (7) Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain. And he shall bring forward the top stone amid shouts of ‘Grace, grace to it!’” (8) Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, (9) “The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also complete it. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. (10) For whoever has despised the day of small things shall rejoice, and shall see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. “&lt;strong&gt;These seven are the eyes of the LORD&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;which range through the whole earth&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll definitely have more to say about this passage as we progress through Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/99182ebc8b48e3cf451a1c910c04df16.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever specifically was wrong with Sardis it is, of course, no accident that the Author of these letters in Revelation (who for simplicity we&amp;rsquo;ll call Jesus) describes Himself as the one with the Sevenfold Spirit. Perhaps the people of Sardis were resting in their own accomplishments and had no use for the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know from Chapter 1, Jesus&amp;rsquo; description has a connection to the Temple Menorah. The photo is from Jerusalem at the government building called the Knesset. At the Knesset, there is a large Menorah that has 29 separate reliefs showing the History of Israel, with Jacob and Rachael, to Moses, all the way to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. Along the outer branches, reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;לא בחיל ולא בכח כי אם־ברוחי אמר יי צבאות&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zechariah 4:6: &amp;ldquo;not by might, nor by power but by my Spirit says Adonai Tzavaot.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is reminding Sardis of this verse. Perhaps they were being fooled into thinking they had things under control in their own strength. We run this risk as well. Zechariah 4:6 is an important verse for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;no-positives&#34;&gt;No positives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some commentators view &amp;ldquo;you have a name for being alive&amp;rdquo; as the positive. I suggest this statement is at all a positive because what good is having a good reputation if it&amp;rsquo;s not really true under the surface? &amp;ldquo;You have a name for being alive&amp;rdquo; might be what we would call a backhanded compliment. Jesus knows that the so-called accolade is empty because it&amp;rsquo;s not really true under the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I recommend the entire sentence, &amp;ldquo;I know what you are doing—you have a reputation/name for being alive, but in fact, you are dead&amp;rdquo; as the complete statement of judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;judgment&#34;&gt;Judgment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Revelation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(1) &amp;ldquo;I know what you are doing—you have a reputation for being alive, but in fact you are dead!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 Sa 16:7 But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the LORD sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.”  &lt;br&gt;Pro 21:2 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but the LORD weighs the heart. &lt;br&gt;Deu 12:8 “You shall not do according to all that we are doing here today, everyone doing whatever is right in his own eyes, &lt;br&gt;Jdg 17:6 In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the harshest criticism yet leveled at any of the cities and is only surpassed by Laodicea, the 7th and final letter. It is fitting that Laodicea and Sardis are the only two cities of the seven that are uninhabited today.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name/Reputation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the Hebrew word שֵׁם, the Greek word ονομα (onoma) means not only your legal name but also your reputation. One can have a good name or a bad name. In Sardis&amp;rsquo; case, they appear to outsiders that they have it all together but deep down they were being hypocritical. Lizorkin speculates that, unlike the other churches we have studied, the believers in Sardis may have been wealthy. It is still true today that many people believe material wealth indicates blessing from God. We can conclude that the believers in Sardis were self-deceived. Perhaps these good deeds were financial gifts to others, for which the donors took pride. &amp;ldquo;They may have been behind much of the funding that the first-century followers of Jesus distributed to those in need.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus doesn&amp;rsquo;t just say they are sickly and need to get better; He says they are &amp;ldquo;dead.&amp;rdquo; We can imagine that the people of Sardis believed themselves spiritually impregnable and put on a façade. They didn&amp;rsquo;t know that Jesus who is amidst the churches was not fooled. He knows they are dead. There is good and bad news associated with this statement. The bad news is that if you are dead, there is nothing you can do to change your situation. The good news is that it helps to know someone who can do something about your situation. Jesus is in the resurrection business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/bd3c3cecf327b2b447b1b2759eabac38.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of verses in the Old Testament and New Testaments that speak to the fact that God knows a man&amp;rsquo;s thoughts and expects inward purity, not just an outward pretense. We will look at a few of these below, but one example is 1 Samuel 16:7, where the prophet Samuel is seeking David. His father Jesse, doesn&amp;rsquo;t even bother bringing David out. He&amp;rsquo;s the youngest, and perhaps not as outwardly impressive as his older brothers. Samuel responds with the famous quote, &amp;ldquo;the LORD sees not as man sees. Man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/b489dafd2dbf3f0581233e1cd064a338.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related to this is the concept of doing what is right in our own eyes. We see this prohibited in Deuteronomy yet acted out repeatedly in the book of Judges. If we are not anchored to the King, we are apt to wander. When we wander, we can think we are on the right path, but actually, be hopelessly lost. Samson is a perfect example of this. He was called to be set apart for God, even taking a Nazirite vow to abstain from things that were otherwise permitted. In the same way, we might give something up for Lent today. It&amp;rsquo;s a form of self-affliction or fast meant to draw us closer to God. Samson rejected all this in favor of doing whatever pleased him at the moment, all the while thinking he was right with God.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(2) Wake up, and strengthen what remains, before it dies too! For I have found what you are doing incomplete in the sight of my God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Joh 11:11 After saying these things, he said to them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him.”  &lt;br&gt; Mar 14:38 Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”  &lt;br&gt;Jas 1:22-24 But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. (23) For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. (24) For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wake up and strengthen!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/aa949def2af0b3d4729891fe707e3601.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebraic thought, to say that one &amp;ldquo;sleeps&amp;rdquo; could also denote death. Jesus saying, &amp;ldquo;wake up,&amp;rdquo; could be akin to calling a dead Lazarus from the grave (and like Lazarus, apparently this church also &amp;ldquo;stinketh&amp;rdquo;). This is also the same Greek word He used in Mark 14:38 in the Garden of Gethsemane after he came upon the disciples literally sleeping.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If you know anyone named &amp;ldquo;Greg&amp;rdquo;, the name comes from this Greek word for watchful or vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either case, He&amp;rsquo;s calling this church to get up. The work isn&amp;rsquo;t finished yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, with Sardis military history, they were literally asleep when they should have been keeping watch for enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incomplete&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We mentioned previously that gentiles were still subject to the annual emperor worship requirement. We&amp;rsquo;re speculating but perhaps their wealth curried favor with the Roman leadership. Were they able to buy their way out of the requirement? If so, the hypocrisy could involve the same types of mixing and corruption we saw in Pergamum and Thyatira. Jesus demands purity. Stern also notes that a hypocrite is also one whose doctrine may be exactly spot on, but otherwise live with a lack of faith and produce no fruit.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Perhaps the believers in Sardis were missing Jesus by 18&amp;rdquo; (the distance from the head to the heart). Hence, this could be one application of &amp;ldquo;Incomplete in the sight of God.&amp;rdquo; They were mixed every bit as much as Pergamum and Thyatira were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another speculation is that they had fled serious study of God&amp;rsquo;s Word (which, remember in the first century was the Old Testament only), in view of man-made doctrines and activities. At best, like James 1:22 says, they were hearers only, not doers. Sardis could speak of the church that has a Statement of Faith that no one could argue with but inside, replaces doing God&amp;rsquo;s word with other religious activity that everyone assumes must be pleasing to God. James continues to say that such a person or such a church is not anchored in the reality of Scripture, or worse, they customize their own version of Scripture, which may be in direct conflict with what is actually written. &amp;ldquo;Not knowing Holy Scripture means we cannot know God&amp;rsquo;s will for us. And if we do not know God&amp;rsquo;s will, then we cannot do God&amp;rsquo;s will.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:21&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(3) So remember what you received and heard, and obey it, and turn from your sin! For if you don&amp;rsquo;t wake up, I will come like a thief; and you don&amp;rsquo;t know at what moment I will come upon you.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deu 6:3-9 Hear therefore, O Israel, and be careful to do them, that it may go well with you, and that you may multiply greatly, as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.  (4) “Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.  (5) You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.  (6) And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart.  (7) You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.  (8) You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.  (9) You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.  &lt;br&gt;Mat 24:42-43 So stay alert, because you don&amp;rsquo;t know on what day your Lord will come. (43) But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into.   &lt;br&gt;1Th 5:2 because you yourselves well know that the Day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.   &lt;br&gt;Rev 16:14-16 For they are demonic spirits, performing signs, who go abroad to the kings of the whole world, to assemble them for battle on the great day of God the Almighty. (15) (“Behold, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake, keeping his garments on, that he may not go about naked and be seen exposed!”) (16) And they assembled them at the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember what you received and heard, and obey!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There could be any number of things Jesus was referring to when He said, &amp;ldquo;remember what you received and heard, and obey.&amp;rdquo; Considering the enforced pagan worship, Lizorkin speculates that a logical assumption is the great Shema, in Deuteronomy 6:4 and following. This is the oath of allegiance to which the Apostle John would have followed and would have taught his Jewish and Gentile believers to follow. Again, the Shema speaks to the purity of worship God expects. Lizorkin writes, &amp;ldquo;Israel&amp;rsquo;s God alone must be worshipped. For His worshippers, there can be no other Gods.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:22&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In terms of what Jesus expected them to repent and turn towards, we need simply look back at Thyatira and remind ourselves of that great list of positives they received: Love, trust, service, and perseverance, and their last works were better than the first. The image says &amp;ldquo;Shema Israel&amp;rdquo; and is inscribed on the beautiful menorah at the Israeli Knesset. The Knesset is the &amp;ldquo;capitol hill&amp;rdquo; of Israel. The menorah depicts Israel&amp;rsquo;s Biblical and modern history in a series of reliefs.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:23&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:23&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the existence of the physical church in Sardis through the 14th century is evidence that they heeded Jesus&amp;rsquo; words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repent or I will come as a thief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stern judgment is, fortunately, accompanied by a call to repent and be resurrected. For those who fail to heed that call, He will return for the final judgment exactly like a thief strikes. More good news: He evidently does NOT come as a thief for those who repent. Coming as a &amp;ldquo;thief in the night&amp;rdquo; was the repeated downfall of Sardis. Sardis&amp;rsquo; acropolis was never taken by enemy force so much as it was yielded by apathy and inattention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus told MANY parables expressing this sentiment of being watchful and staying on task. We can broadly label them &amp;ldquo;man goes on a journey&amp;rdquo; parables. There are several variations (study Gospel Backgrounds with us to learn more!), but essentially, a man with wealth needs to go on a journey. He leaves a few of his hired hands or family members in charge of the business. He then returns unexpectedly and demands an immediate audit of the books. Depending on the parable, there are two groups: one group slacked off and did nothing, while the other was focused on the task. The former group is punished while those who grew the business were rewarded. The parable of the 10 Virgins in Matthew 25 is another variation on this theme. The groom goes away and returns unexpectedly. Five virgins are ready while the other five were not ready. Jesus will revisit the thief imagery in Revelation 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thief in the night vs thief in the day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Torah clearly promotes private property rights and prescribes penalties and remediation for theft or negligent loss of someone else&amp;rsquo;s property. The right of people to defend themselves and their property from harm or theft is also attested. Sometimes this results in the slaying of the would-be thief. Lancaster notes that there are two different classifications in the Torah depending on whether the act happened at night or during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exo 22:2-3 If a thief is found breaking in and is struck so that he dies, there shall be no bloodguilt for him, (3) but if the sun has risen on him, there shall be bloodguilt for him. He shall surely pay. If he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At night, the slaying of a thief is always assumed to be self-defense. The property owner has no way of knowing whether the thief is armed and dangerous. During daylight, the owner is expected to assess and grade the level of threat. Deadly force should only be used in the face of a deadly threat. In matters of excessive use of force, the property owner could be found guilty of murder if it was determined that he knew or should have known his life was not in immediate danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this relate to Yeshua saying, &amp;ldquo;I come as a thief?&amp;rdquo; During His first coming, Jesus was the &amp;ldquo;thief&amp;rdquo; metaphorically speaking who came in the daylight. He was murdered based on trumped-up charges and false accusations. His life was taken without proper diligence. This act resulted in blindness and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During His second coming, as he states repeatedly, He will come as a thief in the night. Unsuspecting people will not be ready. This is not to say Jesus is a thief worthy of death. Many times in the Gospels, He compares Himself or God the Father to all sorts of disagreeable characters (including a grumpy neighbor who reluctantly opens the door and a dishonest bookkeeper who fraudulently reduces his master&amp;rsquo;s receivables) to make a point. If imperfect people do a certain thing, how much more will a perfect God make things right. If a dishonest thief comes at night and surprises the unsuspecting, how much more will the son of Man come in righteous judgment when the unsuspecting are not prepared (Mark 24:43).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(4) Nevertheless, you do have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes; and they will walk with me, clothed in white, because they are worthy.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 61:10 I will greatly rejoice in the LORD; my soul shall exult in my God, for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation; he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest with a beautiful headdress, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.  &lt;br&gt;Rev 19:8 it was granted her to clothe herself with fine linen, bright and pure”— for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.  Ecc 9:8 Let your garments be always white. Let not oil be lacking on your head.   &lt;br&gt;Isa_61:10 I will greatly rejoice in the LORD; my soul shall exult in my God, for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation; he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest with a beautiful headdress, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. &lt;br&gt;Mat 23:27 “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people&amp;rsquo;s bones and all uncleanness.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence indicates that Sardis was known for its luxury textile and clothing trade, perhaps providing a local backdrop for verse 4.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:24&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:24&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Themes of purity recur throughout the book of Revelation, which is symbolized by white clothing. The believers in Sardis may have thought they were wearing white, and may have appeared to others that they were wearing white, but to Jesus&amp;rsquo; eyes, they were soiled. Culturally, white robes were also worn by priests and sometimes worshippers of pagan deities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/5a6c1cb2f6efc2e3ba094ae0bceb26e2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus had a lot to say about pretentious external religiosity. In Matthew 23:27, Jesus states “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people&amp;rsquo;s bones and all uncleanness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:25&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:25&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; During the days leading up to Jewish feasts where ritual purity was commanded, volunteers would mark gravesites with white paint. This was done so that celebrants didn&amp;rsquo;t inadvertently come into contact and defile themselves. In context, the whitewash is actually calling attention to something unclean, so Jesus&amp;rsquo; comparison is all the more stinging. Jesus knew their works, just like He knows our works. When we study the Gospels, it is helpful to put ourselves in the shoes of everyone Jesus interacts with. In other words, we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t point fingers at the scribes and the Pharisees. We should introspectively examine how you and I can be like whitewashed tombs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(5) He who wins the victory will, like them, be dressed in white clothing; and I will not blot his name out of the Book of Life; in fact, I will acknowledge him individually before my Father and before his angels.

&lt;td&gt;Exo 32:30-33 The next day Moses said to the people, “You have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.”  (31) So Moses returned to the LORD and said, “Alas, this people has sinned a great sin. They have made for themselves gods of gold.  (32) But now, if you will forgive their sin—but if not, please blot me out of your book that you have written.”  (33) But the LORD said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me, I will blot out of my book. &lt;br&gt;Psa 69:27-28 Add to them punishment upon punishment; may they have no acquittal from you.  (28) Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; let them not be enrolled among the righteous.  &lt;br&gt;Dan 12:1 “At that time shall arise Michael, the great prince who has charge of your people. And there shall be a time of trouble, such as never has been since there was a nation till that time. But at that time your people shall be delivered, everyone whose name shall be found written in the book.  &lt;br&gt;Mal 3:16 Then those who feared the LORD spoke with one another. The LORD paid attention and heard them, and a book of remembrance was written before him of those who feared the LORD and esteemed his name.  &lt;br&gt;Rev 20:12 And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done. Rev_20:15 And if anyone&amp;rsquo;s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.  &lt;br&gt;Rev 20:12 And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done. Rev_20:15 And if anyone&amp;rsquo;s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.  &lt;br&gt;Luk 12:8-9 “And I tell you, everyone who acknowledges me before men, the Son of Man also will acknowledge before the angels of God,  (9) but the one who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of God. Mat_26:75 And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” And he went out and wept bitterly. .&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancient cultures had official rolls to which citizens could be added or erased,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:26&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:26&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but likely more in view is the Jewish concept of the eternal book of life (see the Exodus, Daniel, and Malachi verses above). The Jewish holiday of Rosh HaShanah (also knows as the feast of trumpets, from Leviticus 23:24, which commands the shofar blown on this day) is literally the Jewish first of the year, i.e. new year&amp;rsquo;s day on the Hebrew calendar. This begins a 10-period day of intense reflection and f repentance, leading up to the most solemn day of the year, Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement (see Leviticus 16). On Rosh HaShana, Jews bless each other by saying, &amp;ldquo;may your name be inscribed in the book of life.&amp;rdquo; In other words, the Book of Life is an entirely Jewish concept. In Exodus 32, Moses is willing to take the place of the people so their names would not be blotted out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not blotting out one&amp;rsquo;s name can be problematic from an eternal security perspective. By a plain sense reading, for a name to be blotted out, it had to first be written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than debating that argument, we need to focus on what Jesus is saying to US personally. Do we think we are dressed in white when we may be soiled? Self-deception – thinking they were right with God when they really were not - is a recurring theme among the churches with judgments. Let us not be so smug as to think we are immune from this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Malachi, the criteria for inscription in the Book of Life is straightforward. Fear the Lord with awe-filled reverence, and honor His name by being a worthy ambassador and talmid/disciple.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:27&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:27&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I will acknowledge him&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/9671e74e8d0da4fad0e39e10fca87bc2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statue is at the Church of St. Peter in Gallicantu, south of the Old City in Jerusalem.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:28&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:28&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It depicts Peter with three of his accusers and Peter denying three times on the night Jesus was arrested. The Latin inscription at the base (Non novi illum) means “I do not know Him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all need to be thankful for Peter&amp;rsquo;s denial. At this location in Jerusalem, we remember that we ALL at some point in our lives have denied Him or otherwise have not represented Him in a way that is worthy of His sacrifice for us. So are all of us going to be denied by Jesus in Heaven? This is a scary proposition, but we have good news. We know from Peter&amp;rsquo;s experience that Luke 12:9 is not necessarily an absolute truth. The general rule is &amp;ldquo;deny Me and I&amp;rsquo;ll deny you,&amp;rdquo; but we have a blessed exception. For this, we travel to another location in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/0d4a01fc2e54cc77c42999c744ba42c3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;We travel to Tabgha in the Sea of Galilee, where we look at John 21 and Peter&amp;rsquo;s restoration. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:29&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:29&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus asks Peter three times, &amp;ldquo;do you love me&amp;rdquo;, one time for each denial. Jesus recommissions Peter&amp;rsquo;s apostleship. This restoration allows us to go back to Luke 12:9 and if our hearts are broken about those times we deny Him, and we repent, He will restore us just as He did Peter at Tabgha. We, therefore, escape the judgment of Luke 12:9 and Revelation. Conversely, if a person&amp;rsquo;s denial carries a nuance of willful unrepentance and defiance, it might be &amp;ldquo;game over.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the reasons, if not THE reason that makes Tabgha in Israel such a special place is that is where tradition tells us that Peter was restored in John 21. We call it &amp;ldquo;Restoration Beach.&amp;rdquo; When I really mess up and let Him down, I go to that beach in my mind and receive His forgiveness and restoration. In fact, this is the theme running through all seven promises to the overcomer. To be an overcomer, we repent of our sins and let Jesus restore us to living in His will instead of ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sardis is a problem. Unlike Ephesus, Pergamum, and Thyatira, there were zero outward signs at Sardis that anything was wrong. There was no eating of prohibited food, evidently not having wild sex parties, nor were they comingling with paganism. It&amp;rsquo;s clear the believers themselves thought they were right where God wanted them to be. They were deceived. This is a huge warning to us. Could we be similarly deceived? As we&amp;rsquo;ve noted previously, we must open our books for God&amp;rsquo;s inspection. One thing as an auditor you have to prepare for when delivering your findings is the fact that sometimes management will push back during your exit report. They will argue with you that your findings are not that bad and present rationales supporting their position. Often this means they have deceived themselves that things are ok when they really are not ok. In contrast, astute managers will take even the slightest ding on an audit report very seriously and fix what may be a small problem, so that it does not become a big one. Let us be like that second group. These Seven Letters show that it&amp;rsquo;s critically important that we see ourselves the way Jesus sees us. The letters also show that how we see ourselves is typically not reflective of the greater reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;church-age-sardis--protestant-reformation&#34;&gt;Church Age: Sardis = Protestant Reformation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek word for &amp;ldquo;name, reputation&amp;rdquo; is ονομα (&lt;em&gt;onoma)&lt;/em&gt; and the word &amp;ldquo;denomination&amp;rdquo; is linguistically related. Ονομα occurs three times in this brief letter. Protestants would view the Reformation as a tremendous force for good within the church as it corrected a number of errors and non-biblical corruptions. This also corresponded to the time frame where Guttenberg invented the movable type printing press (in 1455), which results in millions receiving and reading God&amp;rsquo;s Word for themselves. So why would a church like Sardis, where nothing positive is mentioned, be a fit for the Protestant age in the 16th and 17th centuries? There are several suggestions made by different commentators. Ultimately, it&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that the Church Age theory is not in the Bible, so it&amp;rsquo;s open to much speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler suggests two reasons. First, the reformation did nothing to correct amillennial theology and the error of interpreting passages symbolically that were meant to be interpreted literally. The letter to Sardis states explicitly that He is returning and they better be ready. But the church that doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe He is coming back will not be ready. In this respect, they are like the group of workers in the &amp;ldquo;man goes on journey&amp;rdquo; parables who did nothing to prepare for the Master&amp;rsquo;s return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/678a4ccf12a54b3c9af9e58d752bb58d.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the Reformation did nothing to correct replacement theology. Luther claimed to cite Romans, but Romans contains the passages that state in no uncertain terms that God is not done with Israel. In his earlier years, Luther appears to have been favorably disposed to Jews because he thought his teachings would lead them to recognize their messiah. When this failed, Luther published some wildly antisemitic papers, that Lutherans don&amp;rsquo;t like to talk about. The photo is what is called a &amp;ldquo;judensau&amp;rdquo; that depicts Jews doing unspeakable things with a pig. Of course, pigs are considered unclean animals to Jews. Like we said previously, Pork is not unclean food. To a Jew, pork is not food at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely a godly man such as Luther would have denounced this disgusting attack, let alone one that adorns a church building, right? Wrong! Here is what Luther proudly said, &amp;ldquo;Here on our church in Wittenberg a sow is sculpted in stone. Young pigs and Jews lie suckling under her. Behind the sow a rabbi is bent over the sow, lifting up her right leg, holding her tail high and looking intensely under her tail and into her Talmud, as though he were reading something acute or extraordinary.&amp;rdquo; God said to Abraham in Genesis 12 &amp;ldquo;I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse those who curse you.&amp;rdquo; I think Luther and other protestant anti-Semites are on the wrong side of that equation. Let US not be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korman adds that the error with both Pergamum and Thyatira was that they were state churches.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:30&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:30&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The Reformation did nothing to untangle this web. Formerly Catholic state churches now became Protestant state churches. Calvin essentially ran the City of Geneva. He was also virulently anti-Semitic and is recorded as executing people he did not agree with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned earlier, some proponents of various flavors of Protestantism seem more interested in winning an argument than in saving souls. Missler used to say that Christians are the only group he&amp;rsquo;s aware of who form their firing squads in circles. How do we think Jesus would react to this constant intellectual debating? My wife and I had an experience early in our marriage where a pastor from one branch of historic Protestantism proudly said &amp;ldquo;we aren&amp;rsquo;t in fellowship with them,&amp;rdquo; referring to another branch of that same denomination. This is not to say that we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t hold firm on positions of doctrine, particularly in modern times when many denominations are embracing anti-biblical positions. Yet at the same time, there is a definite lack of love, faith, service, and patient endurance with one another (Rev 2:19) that is palpably absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one joke first told in 1980s, that has earned the title &amp;ldquo;funniest religious joke of all time.&amp;rdquo; It is a funny, yet sad indictment of the Sardis church, and particularly the Protestant church in America:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I saw this guy on a bridge about to jump. I said, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t do it!&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;Nobody loves me.&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;God loves you. Do you believe in God?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said, &amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;Are you a Christian or a Jew?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;A Christian.&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;Me, too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region Council of 1879, or Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region Council of 1912?&amp;quot; He said, &amp;ldquo;Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region Council of 1912.&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;Die, heretic!&amp;rdquo; And I pushed him over.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:31&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:31&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Mat 13:44 “The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A double sense- We could say Sardis is the treasure for whom Jesus gave up everything, but we ALL are the treasure for whom Jesus gave everything. A second meaning is that Jesus is the treasure Sardis had taken and buried so that no one could find it. They had head knowledge, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t manifest into loving God exclusively. The strongest adherents to reformation theology often want to win arguments about this position or that position, instead of realizing that we are all sinners in need of saving.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;paul-sardis--romans&#34;&gt;Paul: Sardis = Romans&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luther cited Romans frequently - it&amp;rsquo;s the definitive statement on Christian doctrine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It also mentions &amp;ldquo;death&amp;rdquo; 24x and &amp;ldquo;dead&amp;rdquo; 16x - more than in any other book of Paul&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used both of Christ&amp;rsquo;s death and the unbeliever&amp;rsquo;s dead state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sardis shows it is possible to call oneself a believer and still be dead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Romans speaks to a right understanding of our position in Christ and towards each other, yet many of these were left undone by the Reformers
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Position of Israel - Romans 9-11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Position of Gentiles with respect to Israel -Romans 11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not judge other believers who may not think exactly as you do - Romans 14&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appeal to avoid divisions - Romans 16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we believe Sardis had a happy ending. Their church endured into the 14th century, well into the second Islamic period. This suggests that they took Jesus&amp;rsquo; judgments seriously and claimed the promises in Romans 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rom 8:28-30 And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. (29) For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. (30) And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rom 8:37-39 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors (&amp;ldquo;overcomers&amp;rdquo;) through him who loved us. (38) For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, (39) nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Philadelphia, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message of HaKadosh, the True One, the one who has the key of David, who, if he opens something, no one else can shut it, and if he closes something, no one else can open it. (8) &amp;ldquo;I know what you are doing. Look, I have put in front of you an open door, and no one can shut it. I know that you have but little power, yet you have obeyed my message and have not disowned me. (9) Here, I will give you some from the synagogue of the Adversary, those who call themselves Jews but aren&amp;rsquo;t—on the contrary, they are lying—see, I will cause them to come and prostrate themselves at your feet, and they will know that I have loved you. (10) Because you did obey my message about persevering, I will keep you from the time of trial coming upon the whole world to put the people living on earth to the test. (11) I am coming soon; hold on to what you have so that no one will take away your crown. (12) I will make him who wins the victory a pillar in the Temple of my God, and he will never leave it. Also, I will write on him the name of my God and the name of my God&amp;rsquo;s city, the new Yerushalayim coming down out of heaven from my God, and my own new name. (13) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.&amp;rdquo; &#39;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ancient city of Philadelphia lies under the modern city of Alasehir, Turkey. The abundance of seismic activity tied with the city’s history has created a chaotic situation in relation to excavations. There have been few inscriptions found and almost no significant excavations have been attempted. The remains of the Byzantine Church of St. John the Theologian, built around AD 600, are the most substantial archaeological remains currently visible.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Massive pillars suggest the 6th-century church was enormous.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Archaeologists have also found evidence of a stadium, only a part of which is visible today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphia is about 25-30 miles southeast of Sardis; it had the nickname &amp;ldquo;Gateway to the East&amp;rdquo; because of its access to trade routes, including commanding a junction on a Roman Road between Laidocea and Pergamum.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Through Philadelphia, &amp;ldquo;Hellenization&amp;rdquo; spread to the east. Hellenism sought to apply Greek manners and customs, first voluntarily, then forced. Missler sees this Hellenistic &amp;ldquo;missionary&amp;rdquo; activity as support for Philadelphia being a type of the missionary church age (1750-present).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eumenes II, king of Pergamum, had a younger brother Attalus II, who reigned from 159-138 BC. The name means “lover of his brother” and refers to Attalus’s loyalty to his brother in refusing to overthrow him, even amidst encouragement from advisors to do so.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In the same way, we believe the assembly of brothers and sisters in Philadelphia held fast in their loyalty to Jesus in the face of opposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Sardis, possibly the oldest city among the seven, Philadelphia is the newest. The city&amp;rsquo;s growth was impeded by frequent earthquakes, including those in 17 CE that severely damaged Sardis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A possible local allusion in the Letter to Philadelphia is that the city&amp;rsquo;s name was changed twice in the 1st century. At one point, it was named Neo Caesarea after emperor Tiberius, and then to Flavia Philadelphia, after the wife of Vespasian.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Philadelphia is the name that stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All cities of this time would have had enforced pagan worship. Zeus Helios and Anaitis, a person God related to Cybele and later, Artemis, were the patron deities. Temples and coins also featured Zeus, Dionysus, Aphrodite, Asclepius, Cybele, and Nike.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Wilson states enforcement of the required Roman oath may have been especially strict here.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Dionysus was an essential deity as grape production was an important industry. See the vineyards in the photo.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ldquo;Many religious festivals were held at the temple to Dionysus.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As a biblical type, wine is symbolic of marriage and celebration (cf. the Wedding at Cana), and by extension the Messianic Kingdom, also known as the marriage supper of the Lamb. There is a possible allusion to the vineyards of Philadelphia as being the church that will be ushered into the kingdom in the Age to Come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphia is not attested to elsewhere in the New Testament. No remains of a synagogue have been found. Still, there was an inscription referencing a &amp;ldquo;synagogue of the Hebrews,&amp;rdquo; and the legs of a table had menorahs and the four species of Sukkot (aka the Feast of Tabernacles) carved. Church tradition records that John appointed Demetrius as the city&amp;rsquo;s first Bishop. Eleven Christians from Philadelphia were martyred with Polycarp in Smyrna around 156, which is interesting given the cities&amp;rsquo; connection as the only two churches of the seven that had no condemnation. Like Sardis, the Church at Philadelphia held out until the 14th century, including withstanding sieges by the Turkish armies on two occasions. They held fast until about 1390, when they were finally driven out by the Islamic Ottoman Turks. There are a few Christian assemblies there today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(7) &amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Philadelphia, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message of HaKadosh, the True One, the one who has the key of David, who, if he opens something, no one else can shut it, and if he closes something, no one else can open it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lev 19:2 “Speak to all the congregation of the people of Israel and say to them, You shall be holy, &lt;strong&gt;for I the LORD your God am holy&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;br&gt;Isa 47:4 Our Redeemer—the LORD of hosts is his name— is the &lt;strong&gt;Holy One of Israel&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joh 14:6&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and &lt;strong&gt;the truth&lt;/strong&gt;, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.  &lt;br&gt;1 Jn 5:20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may &lt;strong&gt;know him who is true&lt;/strong&gt;; and we are &lt;strong&gt;in him who is true&lt;/strong&gt;, in his Son Jesus Christ**. He is the true God and eternal life**.  &lt;br&gt;Isa 22:20-22 In that day I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, (21) and I will clothe him with your robe, and will bind your sash on him, and will commit your authority to his hand. And he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. (22) And I will place on his shoulder the &lt;strong&gt;key of the house of David&lt;/strong&gt;. He shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open. &lt;br&gt;Luk 1:31-35 And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. (32) He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the &lt;strong&gt;throne of his father David,&lt;/strong&gt; (33) and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom, there will be no end.” And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be since I am a virgin?” (35) And the angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called &lt;strong&gt;holy&lt;/strong&gt;—the Son of God. &lt;br&gt;Mat 16:19 I will give you the &lt;strong&gt;keys of the kingdom of heaven&lt;/strong&gt;, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”   &lt;br&gt;Act 15:15-18 And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written, (16) “‘After this, I will return, and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen; I will rebuild its ruins, and I will restore it, (17) that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles who are called by my name, says the Lord, who makes these things (18) known from of old.’ (Quoting Amos 9:11-12 and referencing Isaiah 16:5)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy One (as a show of respect, observant Jews will typically say, &amp;ldquo;the Holy One, blessed be He&amp;rdquo;) typically refers to God the Father, yet here it would seem to be speaking of Jesus. We can see many verses speak of God as Holy, or the Holy One, and True.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Isaiah 22, Eliakim was given the Key of David. Eliakim was a servant of Hezekiah. For Him to be given the Key of David meant that Eliakim had the authority to act with the full and legal authority of Hezekiah. In the same way, we can infer that the Father gave the Key of David to Jesus, meaning Jesus acts on the Father&amp;rsquo;s full authority. Again we see an example of John 1. The Bible tells us Jesus is with God, meaning distinct from the Father, and Jesus is God, meaning inseparable. (John 1:1). We know that Jesus also shares these keys with Peter in Matthew 16:19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Tent of David&amp;rdquo; from Acts 15 may also be in view. Lizorkin explains, &amp;ldquo;The prophets of old imagined a time when the house of David would be open to all the nations of the earth. The ultimate Davidic servant of God would rule over them in justice and righteousness. The (open door) welcomes gentile followers of the Jewish Christ into the tent of David.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Boaz Michael from the ministry First Fruits of Zion has written a book on this subject called &amp;ldquo;The Tent of David: Healing the vision of the messianic gentile.&amp;rdquo; He describes the Tent of David as &amp;ldquo;the apostle&amp;rsquo;s dream of a unified expression of faith in which Jew and Gentile worship the God of Abraham together and serve Him in the redemption of the world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Based on the reference in Acts 15, Michael argues that this was the goal for gentiles in the early church, but we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten off-track by erasing the Jewishness of Jesus from our faith. Interestingly, he says that Baptists and non-denominational evangelical churches (essentially Baptist churches without the title) are the closest among the protestant divisions to realize this vision.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars are divided on whether these represent the same keys as in Rev 1:18. If we take the words literally, these are not the same keys; however, either way, the keys refer to authority over eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;davidic-covenant&#34;&gt;Davidic Covenant&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;David,&amp;rdquo; in this context, typically refers to the House of David, i.e., the Davidic kingdom. Christians may miss the Jewishness of Gabriel&amp;rsquo;s prophecy to Mary in Luke 1. This refers to what we call the &amp;ldquo;Davidic Covenant&amp;rdquo; in 2 Samuel 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
2 Sa 7:8-16 Now, therefore, thus you shall say to my servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people Israel. (9) And I have been with you wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth. (10) And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and plant them, so that they may dwell in their place and be disturbed no more. And violent men shall no longer afflict them, as formerly, (11) since I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover, the LORD declares that the LORD will make you a house. (12) When your days are fulfilled, and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and establish his kingdom. (13) He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. (14) I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, I will discipline him with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men, (15) but my steadfast love will not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before you. (16) And your house and kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever.’”
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This passage is an excellent reminder of how difficult it can be for us to interpret unfulfilled prophecy. If we were living in 700 BCE, we would read this and say, &amp;ldquo;This is talking about the line of Solomon and his descendants, including our wonderful king Hezekiah. This line will go on forever.&amp;rdquo; If we lived in 550 BCE, we&amp;rsquo;d be in Babylon wondering what happened. Had God&amp;rsquo;s word failed? Had we sinned so bad we forced God to break his promise? If we&amp;rsquo;re followers of Jesus in the late 20s CE, we&amp;rsquo;re wondering if this Jesus will be our political king who restores the throne of David, which will then continue forever? Today, with our hindsight, we can see that there STILL is no earthly king of David ruling from Jerusalem, but we believe we can confidently say that Jesus, not Solomon, is the son of David whose kingdom will be established. He was not the political king they were expecting, but He will return and establish His earthly throne and reign for 1000 years and then on into eternity. As we move into Chapter 4 and beyond, we need to keep in mind that, just as with the people living in 700 or 550 BCE, we may not have the right lenses available to us to say with absolute certainty what a still-to-be fulfilled prophecy exactly means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note a vital aspect of this prophecy. It is &lt;strong&gt;unconditional&lt;/strong&gt;. God does not say, &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; you do certain things, &lt;strong&gt;then&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ll establish your throne.&amp;rdquo; God promises the throne. Period. This matters because there are Christian commentators who say Israel has forfeited this promise because of their national rejection of Jesus as the Messiah. The unconditional promises to Israel now are spiritually given to the church. This theology goes by the name of &amp;ldquo;Replacement Theology&amp;rdquo; because it is said that the Church replaces Israel. The problem is that anyone who believes in Replacement Theology is calling God a liar. There is no other way to say it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus literally returns, He will establish the literal Davidic Kingdom. This is called the &amp;ldquo;age to come,&amp;rdquo; and in that respect, it is a reference to eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these indeed &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the same keys as in Revelation 1, then we would say this is also a reference to eternal life. The keys to death and Hades mean our eventual graves are not our final resting places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(8) &amp;ldquo;I know what you are doing. Look, I have put in front of you an open door, and no one can shut it. I know that you have but little power, yet you have obeyed my message and have not disowned me.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 25:6-8 On this mountain the LORD of hosts will make for all peoples a feast of rich food, a feast of well-aged wine, of rich food full of marrow, of aged wine well refined. (7) And he will swallow up on this mountain the covering that is cast over all peoples, the veil that is spread over all nations. (8) He will swallow up death forever; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from all faces, and the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for the LORD has spoken. &lt;br&gt;Joh 10:7-9 So Jesus again said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. (8) All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. (9) I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. &lt;br&gt;1 Cor 16:8-9 But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, (9) for a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many adversaries. &lt;br&gt;2 Cor 2:12 When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, even though a door was opened for me in the Lord,   &lt;br&gt;Col 4:3 At the same time, pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ, on account of which I am in prison—   &lt;br&gt;2 Cor 12:10 For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.   &lt;br&gt;Joh 14:21 Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen believers in most of the other churches compromise in some way, likely referring to participating in the Roman Imperial cult and its government-mandated worship procedures. Just because persecution is not explicitly referenced in Philadelphia, history tells us that it most likely was occurring. This is something to consider for all of us who want to believe we are a part of the church of Philadelphia today (and possibly where the church-age theory becomes quite strained, as there was no significant persecution in the late 1700s). In contrast, Jesus tells them they have &amp;ldquo;little power,&amp;rdquo; meaning they likely were powerless to stop the persecution going on around them. Like Smyrna, Jesus tells them to hold fast to His message and His name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster believes that saying &amp;ldquo;open door&amp;rdquo; is not specifically a &amp;ldquo;door of opportunity&amp;rdquo; but specifically refers to the open door of our tombs.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He sees these as the same &amp;ldquo;Keys of death and hades&amp;rdquo; and believes Isaiah 22:22 also speaks of unlocking the key of the grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern evangelists view this as an &amp;ldquo;open door&amp;rdquo; to spreading the Gospel. This may not have been the meaning the original audience would have understood; however, this use of the word door is attested to in Paul&amp;rsquo;s letters to the Corinthians and the Colossians. The application is valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J. Vernon McGee, one of my favorite Bible teachers, pastored the Church of the Open Door in downtown Los Angeles. It had a huge &amp;ldquo;Jesus Saves&amp;rdquo; neon sign that used to be visible from the Harbor Freeway. When I was a kid in the 70s and early 80s, my family would go to Dodger games and, as an unbeliever, in rebellion to God, I used to roll my eyes whenever I saw this sign. Now I love God, love J. Vernon Mcgee but hate the Dodgers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are specific themes in the Bible that recur. There are about 100 verses in the Bible that mention door, depending on your translation. If you have a software program and have some time, pull up all the verses containing &amp;ldquo;door.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The allusion to the vineyards of Philadelphia may or may not have occurred to the local audience in this context. Still, all of Jesus&amp;rsquo; promises to the overcomers pertain to the fact that He grants them eternal life. We believe wine will be flowing at the Messianic Banquet. In Mark 14:25, Jesus states that He will not drink the Cup again until the new Kingdom comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(9) Here, I will give you some from the synagogue of the Adversary, those who call themselves Jews but aren&amp;rsquo;t—on the contrary, they are lying—see, I will cause them to come and prostrate themselves at your feet, and they will know that I have loved you.&lt;/td&gt;

For I am God, and there is no other. (23) By myself I have sworn; from my mouth has gone out in righteousness a word that shall not return: ‘To me, every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear allegiance.’ (24) “Only in the LORD, it shall be said of me, are righteousness and strength; to him shall come and be ashamed all who were incensed against him. (25) In the LORD all the offspring of Israel shall be justified and shall glory.”  &lt;br&gt;Est 8:17 And in every province and in every city, wherever the king&amp;rsquo;s command and his edict reached, there was gladness and joy among the Jews, a feast and a holiday. And many from the peoples of the country declared themselves Jews, for fear of the Jews had fallen on them.   &lt;br&gt;Psa 72:10-11 May the kings of Tarshish and of the coastlands render him tribute; may the kings of Sheba and Seba bring gifts! (11) May all kings fall down before him, all nations serve him! &lt;br&gt;Php 2:10-11 so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, (11) and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the typical seven letters outline, this is the section where we would expect a judgment; the part where Jesus says, &amp;ldquo;but I have this against you.&amp;rdquo; This section is entirely omitted from the letter to Smyrna. In the letter to Philadelphia, it is not a judgment pronounced on that assembly. Because of their conduct and faithfulness, the Philadelphia assembly will SIT IN JUDGMENT over non-believers. Then, this is not a judgment of punishment but one of conviction and repentance in the spirit of brotherly love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another connection to Smyrna is that the letters to both churches contain the phrase, &amp;ldquo;Synagogue of Satan.&amp;rdquo; We explored this phrase previously. To briefly recap, this could refer to Jews who are not upholding the high ethical standards required by Judaism, specifically by denouncing one&amp;rsquo;s neighbor, whom God says to love. Indeed, there is some evidence that the Believers (Jewish and Gentile) in Smyrna and Philadelphia may have been excluded from the mainline Jewish population.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It could also refer to the gentile satanic pseudo-salvific religion established by Rome. In that day, a synagogue was something we might call a town hall or a meeting place. It was not necessarily a Jewish religious gathering, although it later came to mean exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, in 3:9, we are given the additional insight that those in this evil gathering will be made to bow before believers in Yeshua. Isaiah, Psalms, and Ezekiel all state that the pagan nations of the world will come bow before Israel, which, in my view, lends more credibility to the &amp;ldquo;Synagogue of Satan&amp;rdquo; being comprised of gentiles. Isaiah 45:25 states that all the offspring of Israel shall be justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/8ed274c7aac96f62d6653f1885a5430e.jpeg&#34; cap=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esther is also a great book. It describes a plot by Haman, who tricks the king into sending out an order to slaughter all the Jews in Persia. Little does he know the new favored queen Esther is Jewish, and she has the King&amp;rsquo;s full attention. She skillfully approaches the King and turns the tables on Haman. The law of the day was that the King couldn&amp;rsquo;t directly rescind the first order, but he could counter it in a sense by allowing Jews to protect themselves. The photo above is from the palace where Esther would have presented herself to the King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haman even had ordered gallows built for a specific group of Jews that he hated, including Mordecai, Esther&amp;rsquo;s older cousin. Esther 7 is where all this unfolds. Ester had arranged a banquet for the King and Haman, where she turned the tables on Haman. The king was so furious he had to step outside to cool down at one point. He returns to find Haman begging for his life from Esther, who was reclining on her couch. You can imagine what this scene looked like to the King when he returned. &amp;ldquo;Will he even assault the queen in my presence, in my own house?&amp;hellip;So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king&amp;rsquo;s wrath abated&amp;rdquo; (Est 7:8, 10). What other people mean for evil, God will use for good. This is the kind of turn-around being spoken of in Rev 3:9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God repeatedly professes His love for the Jewish people in BOTH testaments, including and we might say, especially through their times of rebellion and unbelief. The book of Esther occurred during the period of the Babylonian exile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be challenging to reconcile this unique love for the Jewish people with Jesus&amp;rsquo; statement that &amp;ldquo;no man comes to the Father except through Me,&amp;rdquo; except to say that both are true. To deny either one leads to a theological error. If we read Romans 11 carefully, God has not rejected unbelieving Jews in the same way that other unbelievers perish (Rom 11:1, 11. It sounds crazy, but maybe there are three categories: the saved believers in Yeshua, the unsaved gentiles, and the non-believing Jews, whom God will restore somehow. Hosea 1-2 describes a period of separation, where God gives Israel the name Lo Ammi, &amp;ldquo;not my people,&amp;rdquo; but then He extends His mercy to say &amp;ldquo;ami-attah, you are my people&amp;rdquo; (Hosea 2:23).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us are familiar with the verse, &amp;ldquo;The depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?” This comes from Roman 11:33,34, and contextually, Paul talks about what the ESV calls &amp;ldquo;the mystery of Israel&amp;rsquo;s salvation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Romans 9-11 is a highly worthwhile study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, we should never read &amp;ldquo;synagogue of Satan&amp;rdquo; as an indictment against Judaism itself as a religion or the Jewish people. We must remember that the &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; in Philadelphia and all seven cities were at least 50% Jewish and possibly more like 70% or 80%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we hold to the church age theory, the letter to Philadelphia represents the missionary age from the 1700s to the 1900s. Curiously, this is the time when we saw the rise of many sects claiming to be the &amp;ldquo;True Israel,&amp;rdquo; including Mormonism, Jehovah&amp;rsquo;s Witnesses, Christian Science, and many others. As we&amp;rsquo;ve talked about repeatedly, Replacement Theology would suggest the church has become the true Israel. Could these be modern examples of &amp;ldquo;those who say they are Jews but are not&amp;rdquo; and truly are from the &amp;ldquo;assembly of the accuser&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;(10) Because you did obey my message about persevering, I will keep you from the time of trial coming upon the whole world to put the people living on earth to the test.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Luk 21:20-21 “But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near. (21) Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are inside the city depart, and let not those who are out in the country enter it,  &lt;br&gt;Isa 26:18 we were pregnant, we writhed, but we have given birth to wind. We have accomplished no deliverance in the earth, and the inhabitants of the world have not fallen.  &lt;br&gt;2 Pe 2:9 then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment,   &lt;br&gt;Zec 13:9 And I will put this third into the fire, and refine them as one refines silver, and test them as gold is tested. They will call upon my name, and I will answer them. I will say, ‘They are my people’; and they will say, ‘The LORD is my God.’&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of a pre-tribulation rapture would see this verse as proof that God will remove the faithful before things get too bad. This may or may not be what the text is saying. It could just mean that God will preserve His people through the judgment, as He did with Noah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/2b37cfd620136225a54c39f26fa3466b.jpeg&#34; cap=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 21 appears to be a blended prophecy with part referring to the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE and part referring to the end of days. Verses 20-24 talk about the times beginning with the first Jewish Revolt in 66. Church tradition holds that as the situation in Jerusalem was deteriorating and Rome was preparing for its siege of Jerusalem, believing Jews in the city recalled Jesus&amp;rsquo; instructions to get out and get out fast. They supposedly fled to the city of Petra in modern Jordan. The last part of the third Indiana Jones film where the building façade was carved into the cliff was shot in Petra.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I generally would align with the Pre-trib view. One aspect that makes me uncomfortable is that it could lead to believers thinking we will escape persecution. This is likely an American/western viewpoint. In the rest of the world, the church knows way more about being persecuted than we do. We should not be so self-important as to think we will escape what most of the church has had to endure for the past 2000 years. As we studied at the beginning of our study in Revelation Backgrounds, apocalyptic literature was provided to comfort people during times of intense struggle and exile. We may not be delivered from death as much as we may be delivered &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; death. In any case, believers are in a much better position than non-believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;people living on the earth&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; is interesting. Connotatively it is used repeatedly, not to mean every person on earth, but a subset of those who have rejected the Lord. We could say these are people who have focused their goals on this world instead of concentrating on Eternal things. We mentioned in an earlier lesson how there are the goyim, and then there is Israel. While technically Israel is another nation along with Egypt, Syria, Turkey, and America, spiritually, Israel is to be set apart. Believers live and dwell upon the earth along with unbelievers, but spiritually we are not earth-dwellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put to the test&lt;/strong&gt; does appear to refer to God&amp;rsquo;s judgment upon the earth. God is not willing that any should perish, but God is a God of justice at the end of the day. The rest of the book of Revelation is about the punishment; again, it is not punishment we need to worry about if we are His. Somehow, repentant believers need not fear this time, whether through rapture or some other form of protection and preservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;does-the-great-tribulation-purify-israel&#34;&gt;Does the Great Tribulation Purify Israel?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting back to restoration of Israel discussion from above, where we mentioned a possible distinction between gentiles who reject Yeshua and Jews who reject Yeshua, Some view the Great Tribulation as simultaneously being God&amp;rsquo;s wrath on an evil earth, as well as testing and purification for the non-messianic Jewish people to bring them to repentance. They base this on Zechariah 13:9: &amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;Zec 13:9&lt;/strong&gt; And I will put this third into the fire, and refine them as one refines silver, and test them as gold is tested. They will call upon my name, and I will answer them. I will say, ‘They are my people’; and they will say, ‘The LORD is my God.’&amp;rdquo; In his teaching on Genesis, Missler notes three groups of people. Those who perished in the flood, those who were preserved through the flood (Noah and his family), and those who were removed before the flood without dying (Enoch). It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait and see whether it pertains to a pre-tribulation rapture. Again, it should never be used by Christians to be hateful of Jews.  The biblical position is that God has not changed his position on having a unique love for the Jewish people. How he will reconcile that with their present unbelief in Jesus is His decision, not mine or yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Rom 11:25-36 Lest you be wise in your own sight, I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers: a partial hardening has come upon Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. (26) And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, “The Deliverer will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob”; (27) “and this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins.” (28) As regards the gospel, they are enemies for your sake. But as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers. (29) For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. (30) For just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience, (31) so they too have now been disobedient so that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy. (32) For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all. (33) Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! (34) “For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?” (35) “Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?” (36) For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a debate about whether many of these verses in Revelation 2-3 suggest a loss of salvation. Would God inscribe a name in a book, only to erase it because of some later rejection? If so, would this mean He is not omniscient? Because of John 10:28-29, I know I&amp;rsquo;m a man, and therefore I&amp;rsquo;m unable to snatch myself out of Jesus&amp;rsquo; AND the Father&amp;rsquo;s hand. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe I have that ability. With that said, I&amp;rsquo;m also not comfortable saying that the person who professes a faith that he or she later renounces, perhaps after decades of faithful service, is &amp;ldquo;once saved, always saved.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m not willing to put myself in God&amp;rsquo;s shoes. Like Pastor Chuck Smith used to say, &amp;ldquo;If you abide in Christ, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about eternal security.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another category that believers CAN forfeit, and this is what appears to be in view in verse 11. That category is rewards. While we can be fortunate we will not face the Judgment for unbelievers; we do have what is called the Bema Seat Judgment ahead of us. This is where God will evaluate our works AFTER we were saved. Missler liked to ask his audience, &amp;ldquo;are you saved? If so, what have you done with it?&amp;rdquo; We will be judged on the treasure we stored up in Heaven, how we have loved our neighbor, how effective we have been at being &lt;em&gt;talmidim¸&lt;/em&gt;and how well we have raised up other &lt;em&gt;talmidim.&lt;/em&gt; One of the rewards is a crown, referenced in 2 Timothy 4:8. Even if we believe it is impossible to forfeit salvation, it IS possible to forfeit rewards through poor choices. If the believers in Philadelphia started to cave to the pressure, they would risk losing their crowns of righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul often spoke of winning the race, which is a metaphor for finishing well and receiving a victor&amp;rsquo;s crown. We should always be like Thyatira – our works today should be better than yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often think we will be given a crown (hopefully!) at the Bema seat judgment. Note that they ALREADY HAVE their crowns. Are you and I living our lives for the kingdom such that we already have our crowns? If so, the warning is to keep holding on and continuing what we&amp;rsquo;re doing. If not, every second we have breath is another opportunity to deny ourselves and live for Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned in the historical introduction, Philadelphia held fast until the late 14th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 3:12-13 I will make him who wins the victory a pillar in the Temple of my God, and he will never leave it. Also, I will write on him the name of my God and the name of my God&amp;rsquo;s city, the new Yerushalayim coming down out of heaven from my God, and my own new name. (13) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.&amp;rdquo; &#39;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1Ki 7:21 He set up the pillars at the vestibule of the temple. He set up the pillar on the south and called its name Jachin, and he set up the pillar on the north and called its name Boaz.  &lt;br&gt;Jer 1:18-19 And I, behold, I make you this day a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the people of the land. (19) They will fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you, for I am with you, declares the LORD, to deliver you.”  &lt;br&gt;Isa 56:4-5 For thus says the LORD: “To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, who choose the things that please me and hold fast my covenant, (5) I will give in my house and within my walls a monument and a name better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heavenly temple will be referenced in Revelation chapters 7, 11, 14, 15, and 16. Stern writes, &amp;ldquo;it is not surprising that its pillars will be believers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2Pillars at Church of Philadelpha&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The later church building in Philadelphia erected these massive pillars, undoubtedly as a reference to Revelation 3:12.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible frequently refers to the faithful as various parts of a defensive stronghold. Probably most famously to Christians is Matthew 16, when Peter is given the keys and is told that the gates of hades will not prevail against the assembly. In Jeremiah 1, believers are as a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against which the enemies of God will not prevail. A pillar indicates power, as we saw with the massive columns at the Sardis temple of Artemis. And yes, these are phallic symbols in every sense. New York, Paris, London, Washington DC, and many other seemingly powerful cities all have phallic pillars as symbols, and that&amp;rsquo;s not by accident. As we progress through Revelation, we will see what becomes of man&amp;rsquo;s power system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve discussed the significance of one&amp;rsquo;s name as equivalent to one&amp;rsquo;s character. Here, the faithful will be inscribed the name of the Holy One (blessed be He). This is in direct opposition to the beast&amp;rsquo;s followers taking on the beast&amp;rsquo;s name/mark as a sign that they belong to him (Rev 13:17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;rsquo;t read the Bible and not acknowledge that God (Father and Son) loves Jerusalem, meaning the city at 31.7683° N, 35.2137° E on a map. Although He loves it, it is tainted by sin and will be restored and made new one day. He loves you and me that way too. When we go to Jerusalem, we are struck by the conflict and tension until we realize it&amp;rsquo;s a picture of us as simultaneously saint and sinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the &amp;ldquo;New Jerusalem&amp;rdquo; in Revelation 21, Jesus will rule for 1000 years from the current Jerusalem (Jeremiah 3:17). I highly encourage a scouting trip to Jerusalem so we know what we are getting ourselves into! To inscribe the name of a city signifies that those in Philadelphia will be citizens of that city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recap, there are four promises between verses 9 and 12:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A witness to the Jews who say they are not (9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be kept from the hour of trial (10) – see the &amp;ldquo;rapture&amp;rdquo; discussion in the church age section&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overcomer becomes a pillar in the Millennial Temple (12)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overcomer receives the name of Father, the new name of the Son, and the name of Jerusalem (12)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we may be second-class citizens in this age, we will be first-class citizens in the age to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;does-it-fit&#34;&gt;Does it fit?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;church-age-theory-philadelphia--evangelistic-church-1750-present&#34;&gt;Church age theory: Philadelphia = Evangelistic Church (1750-present)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphia and Laodicea highlight the possible defect of the church age theory. Although most proponents would assert that at least the last four churches if not all seven types of churches still exist today, we can infer that many of those commentators believe there are really only two churches. Philadelphia is the church of the true believers, in other words, the one the commentator attends. And Laodicea is the church everyone else attends. In other words, Laodicea is the church those who disagree with the commentator attend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphia is seen as the age of the missionary church: the tremendous evangelical explosion that began in the mid-1700s (which coincided with the founding of the United States). However, there is little to connect the situation in the first-century city with this period in church history. There is nothing in the letter that overtly commends Philadelphia for its missionary outreach, save perhaps verse 9, where the church is a loving example to those who &amp;ldquo;say they are Jews but are not.&amp;rdquo; On this point, Fructenbaum notes that this is the time when Jewish missions bore much fruit. He notes that by 1900, some 250,000 Jews became believers.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than this, we have to piece together the fact that Philadelphia was established as an outpost to spread Hellenism and apply the &amp;ldquo;open door&amp;rdquo; references, perhaps not in a way Jesus intended them to be understood. In that sense, during the missionary period beginning with the 1700s, the gospel spread prolifically and, virtually, unhindered to the four corners of the earth. Every door was open. Today that door is closing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphia is also viewed as the &amp;ldquo;raptured&amp;rdquo; church based on the reference to being kept from the time of trial. Because of these reasons, we all want to view ourselves as part of the church of Philadelphia, which is not a bad aspiration. Facetiously, I&amp;rsquo;d say that Smyrna might be in second place, but they were martyred. Who wants to be martyred when you can be raptured!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, we don&amp;rsquo;t find anyone boasting that they are in the church of Laodicea. Missler notes, &amp;ldquo;Let us remember that each of the churches had a different perception of themselves that the Lord Himself had. How sobering to us in our own conceits.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:21&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, the theory holds that the Jezebel element of Thyatira, the dead element of Sardis, and just about everyone in Laodicea will go through the tribulation, but Philadelphia along with the believing fragments from Thyatira, Sardis, and Laodicea will be raptured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally would love to be raptured. Imagine being taken out of this world with all its problems and persecutions, and then you get to be with Jesus! That sounds like a great deal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s the problem. The doctrine of the rapture appeals to my flesh. If I were the enemy, would I want Christians thinking they were going to get the easy way out, perhaps to the point where they start coasting and not engaging with the church&amp;rsquo;s mission? You bet I would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that an entire generation thought they understood the scriptures perfectly and had concluded that the Messiah was to be a political king, but they were wrong. As Missler would say, that should be sobering for us to the extent we think we know how unfulfilled prophecy will play out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;parables-philadelphia--pearl-of-great-price-mat-1345-46&#34;&gt;Parables: Philadelphia = Pearl of Great Price (Mat 13:45-46)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 13:45-46 “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, (46) who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler states, &amp;quot; Of all jewels, the pearl is the only one made by a living organism as a response to an irritation that has been introduced. It is then removed from its place of growth to become an item of adornment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the pearl is removed from the oyster (a non-kosher sea creature) is seen as the pure church&amp;rsquo;s removal from the gentile world prior to God&amp;rsquo;s judgment upon the world, where they will become a pillar, an item of adornment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could also say as a pun, during the missionary age, the world was the church&amp;rsquo;s oyster, though I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s what the Holy Spirit had in mind 2000 years ago!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;paul-philadelphia--thessalonians&#34;&gt;Paul: Philadelphia = Thessalonians&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there one of Paul&amp;rsquo;s letters that contains no judgment but is one of encouragement and perseverance? Is there a letter that addresses the &amp;ldquo;coming of the Lord&amp;rdquo; head-on? Yes! That would be the books of 1st and 2nd Thessalonians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Thessalonian church was commended for its faith (1 Th 1:3) and positive example (1 Th 1:7). Paul commends them for being witnesses (2:10), good students (2:13), and persevering through suffering (2:14). 1 Th 4:13-18 is often considered the passage that supports a pre-tribulation rapture. 2 Th 2:1-12 describes the figure known as &amp;ldquo;the antichrist&amp;rdquo; and appears to say that some restraining force is preventing the antichrist, the man of lawlessness, from attaining his full power. Once that restraining force is removed, then the man of lawlessness will be unleashed. By putting together Revelation 3:10, the promise for the faithful to be kept from the hour of trouble, with 1 Th 4:17, the promise for those living at the time to be caught up in the clouds, and 2 Th 2:7, the statement that the lawlessness will remain secret until the restrainer is removed, we get the theory that the church is the restraining force. Removing that power simultaneously keeps believers from the hour of trouble while unleashing the man of lawlessness upon the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, 2 Thessalonians 2:2 references a fake letter implying that the believers had not been caught up and were entering the period of God&amp;rsquo;s judgment. We don&amp;rsquo;t know who sent this letter, but it could be an example of someone &amp;ldquo;saying they were Jews (like Paul) but were not.&amp;rdquo; Missler sees this as evidence that the Thessalonians were concerned they had missed the rapture. Paul then explains about the restrainer and the man of lawlessness. Parenthetically, here is where I like to point out that grace is not the opposite of law. Lawless is the opposite of Law. The man of lawlessness wants you to think that Law and Grace are opposites!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you believe in a pre-tribulation rapture, I encourage you to do Acts 17:11 research. In no case should this be interpreted as a license to coast. 2 Thessalonians 3 states this directly. We are not to be idle. We must take the whole counsel of God into view. Even if a pre-trib rapture is true, Jesus had many parables saying that He expects His faithful to be diligently going about the kingdom&amp;rsquo;s work while He is away so that we are rewarded upon His return. A pre-trib rapture also does not mean we will be spared from persecution. We need only look at the church&amp;rsquo;s history to see that this isn&amp;rsquo;t true. Conversely, those of us in areas where there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been persecution have been given a much greater opportunity for kingdom work. To whom much is given, much is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Th 1:9-10 For they themselves report concerning us the kind of reception we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, (10) and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Th 2:13 And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Th 3:4 For when we were with you, we kept telling you beforehand that we were to suffer affliction, just as it has come to pass, and just as you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Th 3:12-13 and may the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and all, as we do for you, (13) so that he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Th 4:1-7 Finally, then, brothers, we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God, just as you are doing, that you do so more and more. (2) For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus. (3) For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; (4) that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, (5) not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God; (6) that no one transgress and wrong his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as we told you beforehand and solemnly warned you. (7) For God has not called us for impurity, but in holiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Th 4:15-17 For this we declare to you by a word from the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. (16) For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. (17) Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Th 5:2-5 For you yourselves are fully aware that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. (3) While people are saying, “There is peace and security,” then sudden destruction will come upon them as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. (4) But you are not in darkness, brothers, for that day to surprise you like a thief. (5) For you are all children of light, children of the day. We are not of the night or of the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Th 1:5 This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Th 2:15 So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the traditions that you were taught by us, either by our spoken word or by our letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Th 3:6 Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from any brother who is walking in idleness and not in accord with the tradition that you received from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Th 3:10 For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IN SAMARIA follows Jesus as he leaves Jerusalem and make his way back north to Galilee. Yeshua elects to travel through Samaria, the most direct route to reach Nazareth. We stop at the village of Sychar where Yeshua encounters the Samaritan woman. His disciples return to their homes on the lake, Yeshua take us to Cana. An official from Capernaum travels to Cana to find Yeshua and to implore Him to heal his son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Anachronism&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Misappropriating concepts in time.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“Paul came to cast off Judaism and convert to Christianity.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gentile Christianity as a distinct religion from Judaism would not begin until the late 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century and, arguably was not completed until Constantine. Also, a careful reading of Acts indicates that Paul remained a Torah-observant Jew and considered himself a Pharisee.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Bicameral Thinking&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evaluating two (or more) opposing but seemingly plausible viewpoints and drawing biblical application regardless of which one is factual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bicameral thinking forces us to be Bereans and look at a matter from a different perspective. We may even find that one (or both) viewpoints may be invalid and we must come up with a fresh hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&#34;You have had five husbands and the man you have now is not your husband.  What you have said is quite correct.&#34;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The woman at the well was steeped in sin and was being snotty and disrespectful. Jesus calls out her sin to set her straight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The woman had an extraordinarily hard life with multiple husbands abandoning her despite being well educated in Samaritan religion. Jesus is showing her compassion because He is the God who Sees (El Roi - Genesis 16).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Eisegesis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Reading external presuppositions into the biblical text.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“The woman at the well was being snotty and disrespectful.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;If our presupposition is that the Gospel writers communicated “Judaism bad, Christianity good,” this viewpoint is going to influence our interpretations, even though a plain reading of the text may not support our conclusions.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Exegesis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Letting the text speak for itself.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“Jesus and the woman were engaged in a sophisticated theological discussion.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The text supports the Samaritan woman was reasonably well educated in matters of Torah, at least as practiced by Samaritans. The text also supports that Jesus is instructing her that Judaism is the more correct way.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Macro-narrative&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Larger themes that emerge above the individual stories&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&#34;How is that you, a &lt;i&gt;Ioidaiois&lt;/i&gt;...&#34;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Here, the woman is identifying Jesus as a Jew.  Later, Pilate will also identify Jesus as a Jew. This is something the Jewish leadership never does. Thus, one of John&#39;s macro-narratives is authentication.  Those who should have authenticated Jesus did not; those who should not have authenticated Him, actually do authenticate Him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Presuppositions&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Our assumptions we bring with us as we read the text, including those not directly supported by the text.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&#34;Sir,  you have nothing to draw with.&#34;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;If we view the woman as snotty and sarcastic, we&#39;re potentially going to view this passage as combative.  If we take a view that the woman is a sinner, no better or worse than the rest of us and she&#39;s merely having a discussion with Jesus on par with the one Nicodemus had, we&#39;re going to have a different view of the passage.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:6.15556in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve done a separate background video on the Samaritans where we briefly touch on the Jewish/Samaritan tensions and explore what lessons this may have for us today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jews tended to avoid Samaria and taking the long way around when traveling to/from Jerusalem. This makes the statement that Jesus “had to pass through Samaria” startling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John’s view, God so loved the world, which even included Samaritans. The path of travel is unusual because this is no ordinary love. Jesus can take us to strange, perhaps hostile and heretical, territory to shine His light of truth if we let Him lead us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.30631in;height:4.2612in&#34; alt=&#34;A picture containing outdoor, mountain, grass, nature Description automatically generated&#34; /&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mt-gerezimshechem&#34;&gt;Mt. Gerezim/Shechem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setting for John 4 is Sychar, which is adjacent to Jacob’s well and Shechem. We also have a separate insites video on Shechem, but the big thing to know is that Shechem is flanked by two mountains Mt. Ebal, which is where God commanded the curses to be read and Mt. Gerezim, which is where the blessings were read. Both the woman and Jesus will reference “this mountain.” They are referring to Mt. Gerezim, which was the holy place for the Samaritans (in contrast to Mt. Zion/Jerusalem which is sacred to Jews).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-acts-1711-rereading-a-beloved-story&#34;&gt;An Acts 17:11 Rereading a beloved Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:5.47375in;height:3.76367in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the vast majority of commentaries, the woman at the well as assumed to be one of lose morals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theis is based on the “five husbands and the one you have now is not your husband” comment by Jesus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the text doesn’t directly say this, it’s easy to conclude that the woman is a fallen, meaning sexually promiscuous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us have come to accept this conclusion at face value, because it’s what we’ve all been taught (myself included).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must be aware that this view is going to color our interpretation of the entire passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if there is another explanation for the “five husbands” statement one that sees the woman in a far more charitable view? Our understanding of the woman would completely change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his commentary on the gospel of John, Messianic scholar Dr. Eli Lizorkin presents us with an alternate way to read the story of the Samaritan woman at the well, particularly verses 10-20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to present that here and then ask that we be Bereans and test the theory to see whether it can be supported by Scripture and the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself saying, “that’s not right” first of all that’s good. Never ever take my word for it. Ask whether the “immoral woman” conclusion is something you’ve always been taught or something you’ve checked out for yourself. For most of us, it’s probably the former.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re going to dive into Lizorkin’s theory, not because I’m convinced it’s right in every detail but I think it provides one of the clearest examples of someone who is being a Berean and not afraid to swim against the current of mainstream commentators. There are a lot of lessons there for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of discussion, let’s not assume the worst about this woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt; At the end of the day I like what Dr. Bob Cargill, who is a professor of archaeology at Iowa university and editor-in-chief of Biblical Archaeology Review, says in his courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My job is not to &lt;strong&gt;tell you&lt;/strong&gt; what to think. My job is to &lt;strong&gt;get&lt;/strong&gt; you to think.” As much as possible, we should not automatically accept someone else’s conclusion without doing our own homework. TO me that is the essence of Acts 17:11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-45-8-in-sychar-at-noon-with-joseph&#34;&gt;John 4:5-8: In Sychar at Noon with Joseph&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So He came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the parcel of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph; and Jacob’s well was there. So Jesus, tired from His journey, was just sitting by the well. It was about the sixth hour. A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give Me a drink.” For His disciples had gone away to the city to buy food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.30556in&#34; alt=&#34;A picture containing text, furniture, rug, mat Description automatically generated&#34; /&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alternate-viewsquestions&#34;&gt;Alternate views/questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sixth hour is around noon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many commentators make the time of day a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Only a fallen woman would be out in the heat of the day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some immediate problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noon is not the hottest part of the day, which is usually between 2-4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it’s true the Bible says the evening time is when women go out to draw water (Genesis 24:11); but Genesis 29:7 tells us Rachael was at her well at an unusual time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might have been any number of reasons besides being “loose” that might have resulted in her being alone at midday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachael, as the mother of Joseph, could be another unspoken witness, as she too suffered; first with infertility then she died while giving birth to Benjamin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t even know that this meeting took place in warm weather. McGee and others suggest this took place in late December, making the temperature during the warmest part of the day irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(right about now, if you’re thinking of counter arguments to defend why the Samaritan woman IS a loose woman, good! It means you’re thinking critically about it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They may have been journeying for six hours, depending on when the daybreak was. We can miss Jesus’ humanity. He got tired and hungry, just like the rest of us. “The Chosen” does a great job at portraying His humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sychar was either immediately adjacent to Shechem, or potentially it was an alternate name for Shechem itself. We talk about this more in our Shechem inSITES video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are relatively confident the site of Jacob’s well venerated today is historically accurate, even though it’s not directly stated in Genesis that Jacob did so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protestants tend to discount the concept of holy sites, but most of the rest of the world – other traditions within Christianity as well as other religions- has sites that are sacred to their faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph: What a normal reader might miss is, as Lizorkin phrases it, a silent witness is present for this discussion: the bones of Joseph.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman’s life of suffering parallels Joseph’s in many respects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as Joseph’s suffering brought salvation to Israel, so will the woman’s suffering ultimately bring salvation to the Samaritans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If she’s alone at the well because she’s excluded from society, later we’re going to see that she’s actually not excluded from society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems unlikely that such a woman would have gone in bragging that she met someone who told her all she ever did and that causes the entire village to turn to Jesus; but we’ll get to that in due time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is more likely that by mentioning the time of day, John intended for us to contrast Nicodemus coming at night versus draw some conclusion about the woman’s morals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we do know is a man asking for a drink from a woman, not his wife, was highly irregular; Keener suggests it could have been interpreted as flirting with her although based on her responses, it doesn’t seem that she interpreted it this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true that well encounters between a male and a female sometimes led to marriage (e.g. Gen 24); if that is the type being employed here, Jesus would be talking about our supernatural marriage to Him; not a physical marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that this is a tradition or a societal norm Jesus is supposedly violating, not a commandment in the Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s breaking down man’s walls and divisions, not violating God’s standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus could not have violated any commandments and still legitimately claimed to be the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are at least three norms Jesus is breaking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking with an unmarried woman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associating with a sworn enemy of the Jews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Touching something His culture (but not the Bible) defined as “unclean,” including dining with Samaritans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus comes to her empty handed and needs her help&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bailey: “Jesus humbles himself and need her (help). Jesus does not establish the relationship by explaining how she needs Him and His message. That will come later.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-49-the-woman-appears-startled-by-the-breach-of-etiquette&#34;&gt;John 4:9 The Woman appears startled by the breach of etiquette&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the Samaritan woman said to Him, “How is it that You, though You are a Ioudaios, are asking me for a drink, though I am a Samaritan woman?” (For Ioudaioi do not associate with Samaritans.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image5.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.35in&#34; alt=&#34;A picture containing person, people, group, crowd Description automatically generated&#34; /&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning stages of this drama, they’re dancing around each other like two boxers might. Neither one is directly responding to the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be hard for us to be vulnerable, particularly to a stranger. Small talk is much safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman is, understandably, fixated on the NUMEROUS differences between herself and this Jewish stranger by the well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She knows that Jews would consider her waterpot unclean&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NIV has a footnote for “do not associate” as “do not use dishes Samaritans have used.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again a macro-narrative in John – the Jewish leadership refuses to acknowledge Jesus’ Jewishness; yet many others do, including Pilate in John 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did she know he was Jewish?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably because he dressed like one; most likely, this included a tallit, which somehow was different from the garments of Samaritans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He probably had an accent which though Galilean, would have set Him apart as a Jew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we imagine Jesus looked, talked, and dressed like a traditional Jew or is he a blond haired, blue eyed Jesus? In other words, do we make God in our image?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Talmud records that Jews consider Samaritans unclean and whatever they touch is unclean. Likely the reverse is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words on the page probably do not adequately capture the fact that she has to be absolutely stunned by this conversation; and it’s just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even a Samaritan waterpot is unclean to Jews – Believe it or not the pot has a critical supporting actor role in this drama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-410-mayim-chayim&#34;&gt;John 4:10: Mayim Chayim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus replied to her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who is saying to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image6.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:4.40745in;height:6.63943in&#34; alt=&#34;A waterfall in a forest Description automatically generated with low confidence&#34; /&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus/John continue the macro-narrative of natural water versus the Spirit, here called mayim chayiim, living water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This started in chapter 1 with Jesus’ water baptism and the spirit descending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In chapter 2 we had the ceremonial water, mystically turn to wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In chapter 3, Nicodemus was told he had to be born of the spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In chapter 5, the man will seek physical healing from the waters of Bethesda but Jesus will heal both physically and spiritually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jewish thought, Mayim Chayim was free-flowing fresh water untouched by human hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you filled your swim’pool (as they say in Texas) with rainwater, it would be Mayim Chayim; if you filled it from a hose, it would not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well water was NOT Mayim Chayim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is taking the concept and expanding it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think of “living water” as eternal life but Jesus is likely referring both to His teaching as well as spiritual regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically Jesus is not saying he IS the Mayim Chayim; He must give it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This appears to be a similar statement to telling Nicodemus he must be born again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, a tease, or cryptic introduction not intended to be immediately understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-411-12-are-you-greater-than-jacob&#34;&gt;John 4:11-12 Are you greater than Jacob?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said to Him, “Sir, You have no bucket and the well is deep; where then do You get this living water? “You are not greater than our father Jacob, are You, who gave us the well and drank of it himself, and his sons and his cattle?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image7.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.875in&#34; alt=&#34;A picture containing rock, stone, building material Description automatically generated&#34; /&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alternate-view&#34;&gt;Alternate view&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is often described as the woman mocking Jesus’ perceived inability to provide a drop of water, let alone this “living water.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samaritan or no, I believe it highly unlikely a woman would have spoken this way to a man in that culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to be careful about reading things like sarcasm into the text; we do not have any clue as to tone, voice inflection, or body language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer might say “objection; calls for speculation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background-1&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This appears to be a parallel to Nicodemus’ statement “how can one be born when He is old?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the woman is clueless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we don’t give her enough credit for being spiritually sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus sought her out and He does not cast his pearls before swine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waterpot plot thickens. Here she believes she has something Jesus does not, possibly symbolic of her view that Samaritans are superior to Jews. Watch what happens to her pot by the end of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the reference to Jacob; both sides claimed authority from their lineage from Jacob (just as Jews, Muslims, and Christians each draw authority from Abraham).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s possible she’s asserting Samaritan superiority with this comment, reminding her Jewish visitor that the patriarchs were in Shechem constantly, whereas Jerusalem is only indirectly mentioned in the Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster sees this as her now catching on to the fact that Jesus was hinting at something supernatural.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus of course is greater than Jacob, just as He is greater than Abraham and Moses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-413-14&#34;&gt;John 4:13-14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus answered and said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again; but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never be thirsty; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alternate-view-1&#34;&gt;Alternate view&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many commentators see this as a sharply worded rebuke of the woman’s repeated insolence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to read this as a plain statement, just as with Nicodemus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either case, Jesus is highlighting her deficiency; which was the same as our deficiency before we came into a relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-415&#34;&gt;John 4:15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 The woman said to Him, “Sir, give me this water so that I will not be thirsty, nor come all the way here to draw water.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternate view: Many commentators see her as scoffing, but I see nothing in the text that supports this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps she is thinking he’s talking about a limitless supply of literal water; at this point I doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see her as curious, wanting to know more, but not fully understanding, or perhaps responding with hyperbole (Like Nicodemus’ “reenter the womb” question).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s inviting Jesus to elaborate – remember her question that’s on the table: “Are you greater than our father Jacob?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-416-19&#34;&gt;John 4:16-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 He said to her, “Go, call your husband and come here.” The woman answered and said to Him, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You have correctly said, ‘I have no husband’; for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; this which you have said is true.” The woman said to Him, “Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alternate&#34;&gt;Alternate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main question for us is: Is Jesus sharply rebuking the woman and calling out her sin for the world to see, or perhaps is he saying he knows all about her pain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which would be the more consistent behavior from Jesus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there another location where he calls out a broken sinner and “nails her to the cross of justice,” as commentators suggest He is doing with the Samaritan woman?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He calls out people who claim to be following the truth but aren’t living like it – the Samaritan woman is not in this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is she rudely trying to change the subject, or could she be taking it all in and factually stating that only a prophet (remember, Samaritans didn’t believe in any prophet besides Moses) would know such things and is now on board with the spiritual discussion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it. If some stranger had exposed your sin, wouldn’t you say “ok then. I ‘ll see you around.” I would. She didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being Bereans, how else might we interpret “five husbands?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Husbands die (Ruth remarried for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the men left her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachel connection to infertility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “man you have now” could be a relative because no one else will take her in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 5 “I &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;have&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; no man to help me” is obviously not sexual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying the fallen woman premise is wrong; I’m saying I don’t know. Since I don’t know, I refuse to assume the worst about her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if Jesus is actually saying: “In answer to your question, yes; I am greater than Jacob. I am the God who sees you (Genesis 16). I know all about you and the pain you have endured. You think I’m Jewish so I don’t care about you because you’re a Samaritan, but I do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background-2&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Go call your husband” sounds like “go to my brothers” (John 20:17). A woman will become a witness to a man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, “in answer to your question, yes; I am greater than Jacob. I know all about you and the pain you have endured. You think I’m Jewish so I don’t care, but I do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by the way, this could have been Jesus’ intent even if we assume she was sexually promiscuous - .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to paraphrase the “prophet” comment: “Ok you are greater than Jacob, but are you who I think you are?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think in the back of her mind, she’s wondering if this is the Samaritan Messiah but things aren’t adding up…not yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For still another interpretation, Dobson notes, “Josephus claimed Samaritans worshipped five gods as their ancestors had (see 2 Kings 17:24-34)”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; while claiming allegiance to the one true god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five husbands = five false gods&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One you have now = The god you’re worshipping now, the one you claim to be the God of Israel, isn’t the TRUE God of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, if this theory is true, then the transition to the mountain discussion is seamless and not a change of subject at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 17:11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-420-21-which-mountain&#34;&gt;John 4:20-21: Which mountain?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and yet you Ioudaioi say that in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship.” Jesus said to her, “Believe Me, woman, that a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image8.emf&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:3.65625in&#34; /&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alternate-view-2&#34;&gt;Alternate View&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IF she rudely changes the subject, Jesus does not seem to care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Jesus doesn’t seem to mind, I don’t see why we should make a big deal of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He engages with her in this theological discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume the traditional interpretation that she burned through her husbands because she had loose morals. Don’t you and I have things in our past that we’re not proud of? Jesus is moving on from that to talk about something much more important; a proper relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background-3&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This mountain” = Mt. Gerizim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mt. Gerizim is another silent witness, the mount of blessings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus and the woman could have seen mount Gerizim as they talked&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy studying holy land geography, but this verse is a reminder that we don’t venerate sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biblical sites are signs that point to God and give us insights into His word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we talked about in our Samaritans video, Mt. Gerizim vs Mt. Zion was symbolic of the friction between Samaritans and Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competing holy sites is fairly common; even protestants get in on the action with the Garden Tomb versus the Catholic/Orthodox Church of the Holy Sepulcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that Jesus LOVES Jerusalem,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is about to affirm the Jewish position, which includes a body of Scripture with hundreds of verses on the sanctity of Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should not read any type of Replacement Theology interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He may be foreseeing the destruction in AD 70, but this is not the same as saying Jerusalem is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-422-24--salvation-is-from-the-ioudaioi&#34;&gt;John 4:22-24 – Salvation is from the Ioudaioi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, because salvation is from the Ioudaioi. “But a time is coming, and even now has arrived, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers. “God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image9.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.32153in&#34; /&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salvation from the Ioudaioi is a striking statement given how often Ioudaioi are painted negatively in John’s gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is endorsing the Jewish side of the argument, but, in his internal discussions with other Jews, He has many issues with the practice of the Jewish faith and how it strayed far from what God intended. Don’t get smug: He does that with 5/7 churches in Revelation – instead of man-made practices creeping in over hundreds of years, the late first Century church was only about 60 years removed from Jesus ministry – and they were still straying off course. How much more so are we at risk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being “mostly scriptural” is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because you say you worship the God of Israel, doesn’t mean you actually are – remember the scary phrase “depart from me, I never knew you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was probably as stunned by this statement as Nicodemus was when he was told to be born again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her mind, Jesus’ answer is impossible; there is a third mountain: Mt. Gerezim; Mt. Zion, and the Mt. of Spirit and Truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was caught in a false dichotomy, believing that there are only two choices, and only one of those is the right one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be a rabbit trail to discuss the false dichotomies the world tries to present us with and make us choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to seek Jesus’ way. He isn’t interested in winning arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener: Jesus establishes “the correctness of the Jewish position, although He does not allow that to remain as an ultimate barrier to reconciliation.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is laying the foundation for other non-Jews, i.e. gentiles, to be grafted-in to the correct ways of the Ioudaioi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A time is coming: the fulfillment of the Messianic kingdom is still future;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A time now is: events to inaugurate the Messianic kingdom are in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-425-26-youre-the-messiah-arent-you&#34;&gt;John 4:25-26: You’re the Messiah, aren’t You?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman said to Him, “I know that Messiah is coming (He who is called Christ); when that One comes, He will declare all things to us.” Jesus said to her, “I am He, the One speaking to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster suspects she may be politely trying to end the conversation here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement reminds me of Nicodemus saying “Rabbi, we know you have come from God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as I saw Nicodemus asking Jesus to confirm whether He was the Messiah, I think the woman is possibly doing the same thing here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re the Messiah, aren’t you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus answers with an emphatic yes with one of John’s famous “I am” statements in John that establish Jesus as the great I AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Samaritans reject the books we categorize as “the prophets,” she had to draw this conclusion from the Torah only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since they both shared the Torah, Messiah thus is a shared concept between Jews and Samaritans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One view of the Samaritan Taheb is that of a “restorer.” They interpret it as their Messiah will restore Samaritan preeminence. Jesus is a completely different kind of restorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;10-i-am-statements-in-john&#34;&gt;10 I AM statements in John&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 4:26 – I AM He (the Messiah)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 6:35 – I AM the Bread of Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 8:12 – I AM the Light of the World&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 8:58 – Before Abraham was, I AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 10:7 – I AM the gate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 10:11 – I AM the Good Shepherd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 11:25 – I AM the Resurrection and the Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 14:6 – I AM the Way, Truth, Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 15:1 – I AM the True Vine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 18:5 – I AM He (Yeshua of Nazareth)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-427-disciples-amazed-at-the-breach-of-protocol&#34;&gt;John 4:27: Disciples amazed at the Breach of Protocol&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at this point, His disciples came, and they were amazed that He had been speaking with a woman, yet no one said, “What are You seeking?” or, “Why are You speaking with her?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a few points, John gives a clue to what the disciples were thinking (or at least what &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; was thinking) but not saying at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 21 is another example: “none of them dared ask who it was; they knew it was the LORD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understandably they were shocked by this apparent breach of protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text says they were surprised at His speaking with a woman; they were probably equally surprised that He was speaking with a Samaritan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-428-30-leaving-your-waterpot-behind&#34;&gt;John 4:28-30: Leaving your waterpot behind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the woman left her waterpot and went into the city, and said to the people, “Come, see a Man who told me all the things that I have done; this is not the Christ, is He?” They left the city and were coming to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;waterpot-left&#34;&gt;Waterpot left&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image10.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.875in&#34; alt=&#34;A picture containing dirty, stone, kitchen appliance Description automatically generated&#34; /&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to read a story and ask, “why is that there?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bit about the waterpot seems irrelevant – if the text had said, “so the woman went into the city and said…,” we wouldn’t think anything of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned above, the waterpot was symbolic of the divide between Jews and Samaritans. She’s leaving that behind (literally and figuratively at Jesus’ feet) in addition to her former life of pain and misery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ living water has replaced the water of Jacob’s well.” – Keener&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the waterpot that you need to leave behind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walking In His Dust&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Talmidim leave our pain and brokenness at Jesus’ feet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colossians 1:13-14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For He &lt;strong&gt;rescued&lt;/strong&gt; us from the domain of darkness, and &lt;strong&gt;transferred&lt;/strong&gt; us to the kingdom of His beloved Son, in whom we have &lt;strong&gt;redemption&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;forgiveness&lt;/strong&gt; of sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alternate-view-3&#34;&gt;Alternate View&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This verse is critical to our alternate hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we already have a preconceived notion about the woman, then we probably read “everything I ever did” as a list of her sinful acts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fallen woman probably would not brag about someone exposing a list of her sinful acts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The townsfolk likely would not care what a fallen woman said, yet they respond to her invitation. In general, the testimony of a woman was not well regarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One commentator suggests that she went to the men of the town and not the women because she’d had sex with all the men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is there no support in the Bible for this position, but it also betrays a heart filled with negativity, cynicism, and condemnation of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us not be like this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus a nuance of “He knows everything about me,” seems to fit the context better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John arranged this to intentionally follow John 3:16 – God So loved the world. Salvation is from the Jews but salvation is not limited to Jewish people (neither are they excluded)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chapter demonstrates the difficulty in interpreting a Bible passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re thousands of years and thousands of miles away from when and where these events happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lizorkin: “We bring our past, our preconceived notions, our already formed theology, our cultural blind spots, our social standing, our gender, our political views and many other influences to our interpretation.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we challenge popular commentaries it’s not about being contrarian as much as it is an attempt to enrich our understanding by gaining a different perspective, similar to viewing a work of art from an angle as opposed to directly in front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also not personal to anyone who holds these views, most of whom are smarter and more spiritual than I will ever be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bereans receive teaching and search the scriptures to see whether these things be so. If we simply accept a given interpretation without grappling with it, we aren’t being good Bereans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus knocked down much bigger walls than Joshua did when He entered Samaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keener: “Jesus crosses strict cultural boundaries separating races, genders, and moral status, pointing to the new and ultimate unity in the Spirit. (What he did) would be roughly equivalent to defying segregation in the United States during the 1950s…shocking, extremely difficult, somewhat dangerous. The Jesus of the Gospels is more concerned with people than with custom.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amos 9:11-15 speaks of eventual restoration of the Tent of David, meaning a time when the nation was united north/Israel and south/Judah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll pick up next time with a phrase that is mentioned in all four gospels: “A prophet has no honor in his own hometown.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sons-of-abraham&#34;&gt;Sons of Abraham&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the Bible will be focused on Abraham and his descendants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish people are Abraham’s legal descendants while the disciples of Jesus are Abraham’s spiritual descendants by faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul, in various places, confirms that, through Jesus, gentile disciples can rightly refer to him as “Abraham, our father.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as it is true that not all biological descendants of Abraham (such as Ishmaelites and Edomites) can claim the promises, not all Gentiles and even not all gentiles who profess a belief in Jesus can make this claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster: “The critical paternity test is this question: ‘Are you walking in the footsteps of Abraham’s faith?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“(The &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi)&lt;/em&gt; answered him, “Abraham is our father.” Jesus said to them, “If you were Abraham&amp;rsquo;s children, you would be doing the works Abraham did” (John 8:39).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement is true of Christians who claim spiritual inheritance as much as it is of Jews who claim physical inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what were the works of Abraham?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages list 10 specific trials of Abraham; some he passed and some he failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ten Tests of Abraham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call from his homeland&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The famine in Canaan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abduction of Sarah in Egypt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The war with the four kings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wait for a son and his marriage to Hagar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circumcision&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abduction of Sarah by Abimelech&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Exile of Hagar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Exile of Ishmael&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sacrifice of Isaac&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, Abraham stood against idolatry and was willing to sacrifice his life for his convictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believers are to emulate Abraham where he succeeded and learn from Abraham where he failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let us study Abraham with a view toward strengthening our personal discipleship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Schlegel notes, our faith is founded on events that took place in time and space (history and geography).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.png&#34; style=&#34;width:5.44444in;height:5.36111in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Moody Bible Atlas map&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; shows the suggested route (solid green line) through Damascus. Abram possibly acquired the servant Eleazar at this time. Eleazar will be a pivotal supporting character in the story of Abram. As Abram’s eldest servant, he stood to inherit Abram’s estate if Abram had no natural offspring. Eleazar means God’s Helper and in many ways, we will see he is a biblical type of the Holy Spirit, especially in Genesis 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.27986in;height:9in&#34; /&gt;This Satellite Bible Atlas map&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; shows the journey to Shechem, through the center of the country to the Negev, and then eventually to Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Shechem, then Bethel (Luz) and Ai, then Negev&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We don’t know exactly how he got to Shechem, but the Wadi Far’a is a good inland road from the Jordan valley.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God visits Abram and promises inheritance to Abram’s seed and Abram builds an altar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He next moves to an area between Bethel and Ai.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ai is familiar to those who have studied Joshua as the place where the Israelites were defeated because there was “sin in the camp” – the lesson is that we are all in a community – when one member sins, we all sin and suffer the consequences. We usually think of our faith as individualistic. My business is between God and me; the Bible teaches both individual and corporate/community accountability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He then moved further south to the Negev past Hebron&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Egypt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abram has gained great wealth but appears to show a lack of faith (we note that it is commonly taught he shows a lack of faith but the text doesn’t say this so we need to be careful with our assumptions).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Egypt is generally viewed as a type of the world with its enticements and trappings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He places his wife in harm’s way while he accumulates more possessions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Later we will learn that Abram picked up a concubine named Hagar who would ensnare him with Ishmael as a false substitute for God’s promises&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can’t fault Abram for this – he is a picture of us when we try to help God along. This is something the enemy tempts us with every day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God’s promises are unconditional and will be fulfilled despite Abram’s failure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-121-5--god-calls-abram-to-canaan&#34;&gt;Genesis 12:1-5 – God calls Abram to Canaan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Now the LORD said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father&amp;rsquo;s house to the land that I will show you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great so that you will be a blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you, all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a spectacular blessing of which you and I are the beneficiaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note there are seven distinct promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul says the promises to Abraham are also given to Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, “And to offsprings,” referring to many, but referring to one, “And to your offspring,” who is Christ” (Gal 3:16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great nation – Galatians 3:29 And if you are Christ&amp;rsquo;s, then you are Abraham&amp;rsquo;s offspring, heirs according to promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessings Bestowed - Ephesians 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Great Name - Philippians 2:9-10 Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessings to others - Galatians 3:14 so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessings returned - Matthew 25:34 Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. (those things done for the least of these are done unto Him).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curses returned - Matthew 25:41 “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.’ (those things not done to the least of these were not done unto Him.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the families of the earth –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 3:25 You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 3:8 And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you shall all the nations be blessed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leaving his father’s house, Abram would be forfeiting his earthly inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this as, for the next couple of decades, Abram is childless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the back of his mind, he could have been thinking about what he could have had if he’d stayed put, versus the seemingly unfulfilled promise from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton: “When Abram gave up his place in his father’s household, he forfeited his security. He was putting his survival, his identity, his future, and his security in the hands of the LORD.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God calls us just as he did Abram. Like He does with us, He only asks us to take the next step in obedience (he won’t tell us the whole plan, or we might say no).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going” (Hebrews 11:8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone in the world at that time practiced idolatry. In what I believe is a model of our salvation process, God selected Abram, then he called Abram. Abram did nothing to merit the selection but he did have the free will to reject God’s call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 So Abram went, as the LORD had told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we noted last time, Acts 7 tells us the command from God came when Abram was in Ur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Abram sojourned in Haran suggests a lack of faith on his part;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 12:4 thus can be interpreted that God had to remind Abraham a second time of the promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can be thankful that God doesn’t give up on us when we stumble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother&amp;rsquo;s son, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people that they had acquired in Haran, and they set out to go to the land of Canaan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that Abraham is the first Hebrew because he is the first to come across (heb. &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;עבר&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ever)&lt;/em&gt; the Euphrates River. This is in addition to having a relative by the name of Eber&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 7:4-5 Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And after his father died, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living. Yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot&amp;rsquo;s length, but promised to give it to him as a possession and to his offspring after him, though he had no child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two contrasting ways to view the phrase “people that they had acquired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can literally translate as “souls they had made.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this, the sages depict Abraham as a missionary for monotheism, converting people from idolatry to the knowledge of the one true God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view is intriguing since for most of its history, Judaism has never been a proselytizing religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at it is that Abraham accumulated things and people of the world that serve to corrupt him&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we study Abram, we need to note the times when he is where he is supposed to be and those times when he is not where he is supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever he is not where he is supposed to be, Abram acquires people from that place he’s not supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Haran it was Lot and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Egypt, we will see Abram acquires a handmaid by the name of Hagar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Lot and Hagar will be sources of grief for Abram down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IHD: Both interpretations, even though they are opposite viewpoints, demonstrate the biblical theme of sowing and reaping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 6:7-8 Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap. For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we plant seeds in a place we’re not supposed to be, we shouldn’t be surprised at the consequences – we’ll touch on this again when we get to the story of Abraham and Hagar. Abraham acted in the flesh and there are consequences of his action to this day; but we could go back further and say the problem started when he went to Egypt and acquired Hagar in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, If we plant healthy seeds in others, eventually there will be a harvest – we may not see much fruit but our job is to plant, not to grow the tree. I can’t make a tree grow, I don’t know about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-126-9-in-canaan-the-lord-appears-again&#34;&gt;Genesis 12:6-9– in Canaan, the LORD appears again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 (When they came to the land of Canaan,) Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The honor of being the first city in Israel named in the Bible goes to Shechem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shechem has a mixed history and will ultimately be a source of grief for those who want to follow the One True God. We’ll explore this more a bit later in Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shechem lies in a valley surrounded by two mountains (hills): Mt. Gerizim and Mt. Ebal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It strategically lies at an interchange of the N-S way of the patriarchs and an E-W road, which helped it grow as a center of trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Israelites were about to go into the promised land, Moses instructed Joshua to station the tribes along the two hills. The blessings from the law were to be read from Mt. Gerizim and the cursings were to be read from Mt. Ebal. See Deuteronomy 28.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shechem is in the general vicinity of Jacob’s Well, which is the setting for the meeting between Jesus and the Samaritan Woman in John 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the woman says, “we Samaritans worship on this mountain,” she is referring to Mt. Gerizim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the Palestinian city of Nablus is adjacent to ancient Shechem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram is often associated with trees. Later we will see Abram by the Oaks of Mamre, which is further south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trees, especially large ones, were often thought to be prime teaching or studying locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically, this is because of the shade from the heat that the leaves provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symbolically, the tree representing knowledge is linked to the tree of knowledge back in Eden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trees, which tend to be somewhat phallic-shaped are symbolic of fertility and became adopted as places of worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 Then the LORD appeared to Abram and said, “To your offspring I will give this land.” So he built there an altar to the LORD, who had appeared to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 From there he moved to the hill country on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. And there he built an altar to the LORD and called upon the name of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram, an old man, had no seed at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, these altars are to a God, who would have been entirely unknown to the Canaanites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the text won’t always tell us so, it is a safe assumption that Abram built altars only when the LORD directed him to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ordinary places became holy to Abraham.” Lancaster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word for tent has a feminine suffix so it literally says, “He pitched her tent.” The Midrash comments that Abraham pitched Sarah’s tent first, then his own, which gives us men the reminder that we take care of her needs before ours. This is something that Abram will fail to do in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bethel is being used anachronistically here (technically, the $10 word is proleptic; something done in anticipation). Bethel won’t be called Bethel until Genesis 28:19. At this time of Abram, it would have been called Luz.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Istanbul, not Constantinople.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 And Abram journeyed on, still going toward the Negeb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Negev region of southern Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He would have passed through the cities that would later be known as Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and Hebron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1210-13--flight-to-egypt-deceiving-pharaoh&#34;&gt;Genesis 12:10-13 – Flight to Egypt, deceiving Pharaoh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lest we miss it, God told Abram to go to a land that GOD will show Abram. In verse 7, God says “THIS is the land.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, he departs for Egypt; there is no mention of building an altar and no mention that God told him to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s as if God showed Abram the promise and Abram said “thanks, I’ll take it from here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds a lot like something the person I look at in the mirror every day would do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is difficult to trust God when we think we can come up with a better plan of our own.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also if we look at it from Abram’s perspective, the so-called promised land is filled with wicked Canaanites and now there is no water, which led to a severe famine. In his mind, he had to pack up and head elsewhere to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Egypt, the Nile’s constant waters and predictable flood stages made that land impervious to famine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “I know that you are a woman beautiful in appearance,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they will kill me, but they will let you live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 Say you are my sister, that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared for your sake.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham was not necessarily a great role model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My life will be spared&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Abram concluded that, like David did with Uriah, a husband can be eliminated. A brother can be negotiated with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After they use the same tactic with Abimelech, Genesis 20:13 tells us that Abram and Sarai agreed to use this ruse way back in Mesopotamia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model will be repeated a third time with Isaac and Rebecca in Genesis 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, his life WAS spared, just as the Nation was spared after it fled to Egypt, just as the Messiah was spared after He fled to Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plagues came upon Pharaoh who let Sarai go just as plagues would come upon a different Pharaoh, who, reluctantly, would let the nation go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could take a lot of different angles here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wasn’t where he was supposed to be; so now he has to make a second bad decision as a result of his earlier bad decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is supposed to be the protector of his wife, but instead, he places her in harm’s way, while seeking to increase his financial position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He technically wasn’t fully lying. Genesis 20:12 tells us that Sarai was Abram’s ½ sister, the daughter of Terah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible is not shy about showing us the failures of its heros&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah, around 70, was a striking woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1214-16--sarai-taken-by-pharaoh&#34;&gt;Genesis 12:14-16 – Sarai taken by Pharaoh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 And when the princes of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier he said the ruse was so that “it may go well with me because of you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram got what he wanted apparently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1217-20-pharaoh-smitten-with-plagues&#34;&gt;Genesis 12:17-20 Pharaoh smitten with plagues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17 But the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram&amp;rsquo;s wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18 So Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19 Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her, and go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 And Pharaoh gave men orders concerning him, and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sudden outbreak of disease like this would have been assumed to be a divine curse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can imagine the pharaoh consulting with his magicians and them quickly determining it must have something to do with the new girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God takes marriage very seriously even when we don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can infer that God made the relationship between Sarai and Abram clear to Pharaoh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plague prevented Pharaoh from committing a greater sin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get much more information in Genesis 20, when Abraham will use the same approach with Abimelech, King of Gerar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham left Egypt a much wealthier man than when he entered, but there is a catch to everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we said in the introduction, included in the group of female servants was a handmaid named Hagar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Laodicea, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the Ruler of God&amp;rsquo;s creation: (15) &amp;ldquo;I know what you are doing: you are neither cold nor hot. How I wish you were either one or the other! (16) So, because you are lukewarm, neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of my mouth! (17) For you keep saying, &amp;lsquo;I am rich, I have gotten rich, I don&amp;rsquo;t need a thing!&amp;rsquo; You don&amp;rsquo;t know that you are the one who is wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked! (18) My advice to you is to buy from me gold refined by fire, so that you may be rich; and white clothing, so that you may be dressed and not have to be ashamed of your nakedness; and eye salve to rub on your eyes, so that you may see. (19) As for me, I rebuke and discipline everyone I love; so exert yourselves, and turn from your sins! (20) Here, I&amp;rsquo;m standing at the door, knocking. If someone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he will eat with me. (21) I will let him who wins the victory sit with me on my throne, just as I myself also won the victory and sat down with my Father on his throne. (22) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.&amp;rdquo; &amp;rsquo; &amp;quot;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;laodicea-background&#34;&gt;Laodicea Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/a44ebe9833e723b3ded3abe21304183b.png&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/adda6ac6f07efd9e5d2a64dd4edbcd62.png&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the image above, Laodicea, Hierapolis, and Colossae were in very close proximity, and in terms of wealth and power, the cities formed the metroplex of their day. They are at the eastern end of the Meander River valley, with Miletus and Ephesus on the Western end of that valley. Therefore, it was a natural passageway to distribute goods to and from Ephesus. A second valley, the Lycus River valley, ran Northwest to Philadelphia or southeast to Syria. By the second century BCE, Laodicea became the wealthiest and most important of the three because it sat at the junction of these two valleys. The assembly in Laodicea was the furthest south and west of all the churches. After completing his circuit of bringing the letter to each of the seven assemblies (and likely others along the way), the human messenger would have likely returned to Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city was founded in the mid-200s BCE by Antiochus II, who named it after his wife, Laodice. Laodice combines the words for &amp;ldquo;the people&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;justice,&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or &amp;ldquo;the people ruling.&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This is an interesting name because this is a church where God is on the outside knocking to get in. The Laodiceans were doing what was right in their own eyes. In terms of pronunciation, Greek would have a hard &amp;ldquo;c&amp;rdquo; (Lah-od-ik&amp;rsquo;-i-ah).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/044a8bd7fd3af8f19cd31266a5ff2597.jpg&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a worldly perspective, the city almost had it all. The photo is from the Sacred Agora, one of the many commerce centers of the city.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Many of its supposed strengths will be referenced in Revelation.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; According to God, concerning the assembly of believers, they are not strengths at all but weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was THE banking center of Asia with large stores of gold (and an adjunct industry of gold refiners)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The assembly thinks they are rich, but they are spiritually poor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus offers HIS gold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Textile manufacturing and distribution, primarily black wool
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The assembly thinks they are clothed in righteousness, but they are naked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus offers HIS covering (white raiment versus black wool)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was a medical center, specifical ophthalmology; Collyrium was an ingredient used in healing eye salves as well as cosmetics
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The assembly thinks they have clear vision, but they are spiritually blind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus, the Great Physician, offers HIS remedy: the Holy Spirit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, entertainment was everywhere; it had a large stadium and multiple theaters
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike the actors and athletes who were adorned, the believers were wretched and pitiable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As with all cities, everything was dedicated to a false god
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though not stated directly, the conclusion, given the previous six letters. is that the Laodiceans comfortably co-mingled paganism with worship of Jesus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metaphorically and probably literally, they were dining at the table with false gods in pagan temples, which are the throne rooms of those gods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus invites the believers to dine with Him and Him alone in His throne room and His alone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/2037bd1299892847ad3cf244a76b64ed.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;47%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/3ef883d2bf668df1b72a4e72f21a9629.jpg&#34; width=&#34;53%&#34; style=&#34;float:left&#34; /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;In recent years, archeological work has uncovered many gates, buildings, pillars, inscriptions, and other findings, making it easy to visualize the city&#39;s wealth and prominence. The photo on the left shows a game board from Laodicea.[^5] The photo on the right shows a nearly identical inscription that was found on a stone in Jerusalem in the traditional location of the Stone Pavement.[^6] Some assert that it was the game used by the Roman soldiers when they cast lots for Jesus&#39; clothing right before His crucifixion.
&lt;p&gt;In Laodicea, there are also multiple Nymphaeum locations. A major street with ornate columns on either side ran through the heart of Laodicea. Over ½ mile has been excavated and reconstructed today. We believe it dates to 85 CE, so it would have been a street the believers frequented. The excavations are spectacular from an archaeological standpoint. We&amp;rsquo;ll include a photo gallery supplement after this lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The famous Roman philosopher Cicero lived here and cashed his letters of credit at the banks.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The city was so wealthy that, after a significant earthquake in 60CE, Laodicea refused financial assistance from Rome to help rebuild.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; They had it covered. They didn&amp;rsquo;t need anyone&amp;rsquo;s help. Rome commended this gesture, but unfortunately, this attitude spilled over into the local congregation of believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another record in 62 CE, Laodicea seized 20 pounds of gold that the city&amp;rsquo;s Jewish population (this presumably would have included both believers and non-believers) had earmarked for the Temple in Jerusalem. This suggests an offering from 7000 Jews in the city. If we include family, the Jewish population could have been well over 20,000. One tractate of the Jewish Talmud speaks of the immense wealth of a sure Laodicea Jew.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/0159b3c645b138b34acad47ca46b7776.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a fascinating story in another tractate&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that has some relevance to our study. It&amp;rsquo;s about a man from Laodicea who is sent to the land of Asher in Galilee to fetch a large quantity of olive oil to bring back to Laodicea. The photo above shows a reconstructed Olive Oil press from Yad HaShmonah, near Kiriath Jearim.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He gets what we might call the run-around and finally is told to go and see what to him appears to be a poor field laborer. The laborer tells him to wait until his workday is over. The Laodicean messenger believes he is being played for a fool. He waits, and they journey back to the man&amp;rsquo;s house, where the man&amp;rsquo;s maidservant brings out a kettle of hot water and a vat of oil in a golden bowl for the messenger to anoint his hands and feet. The laborer and the messenger ate and drank together. The &amp;ldquo;laborer&amp;rdquo; then offered the Laodicean even a greater quantity of oil than he initially needed and more than he could afford. The laborer extends the additional oil on credit and goes back to Laodicea with the messenger to help with the massive haul. The people of Laodicea come out to celebrate the messenger for his tremendous feat, but he replies, &amp;ldquo;do not praise me. Rather praise this man who has come with me,&amp;rdquo; as it is he who provided the oil. The story in the Talmud ends by saying, &amp;ldquo;This incident was in fulfillment of that which is stated: &amp;lsquo;There is one who seems to be rich yet has nothing; there is one who seems to be poor, yet has great wealth&amp;rsquo; (Proverbs 13:7).&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing Laodicea did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have was a consistent water supply. Colossae had cold water springs while Hierapolis had hot springs (and like many areas with natural hot springs, it continues today as a resort for tourists). Laodicea could occasionally use river water but otherwise required extensive aqueducts to pipe water in from neighboring cities. Of course, by the time it traveled, it was no longer refreshingly cold like Colossae or therapeutically hot like Hierapolis but a tepid, lukewarm temperature. Additionally, the mineral content was so high that the water, if ingested directly, would induce vomiting. Today, we can see the calcified pipes. We will reserve a discussion on the spiritual significance until we get to verse 16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;images/6659b0bd20c5ad2c231d337f195e3141.jpg&#34; caption=&#34;Cross and Menorah&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large number of Jews referenced above likely formed the foundation of the early community of believers in Yeshua. As a reminder, scholars believe that Jews would have significantly outnumbered the gentile &amp;ldquo;God-fearers.&amp;rdquo; Gentiles would have attended the Jewish synagogue and were divided between believers in Yeshua and non-believers, just as their Jewish counterparts were. The above column shows an inscription of a cross over a Menorah with a shofar, reminding us that our Messiah came out of the light of the Menorah (Rev 1:20).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We are also reminded that the word &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; is an anachronism, as no such word, congregation, or building went by that name in the first century. The term was &lt;em&gt;ecclesia&lt;/em&gt; and, in most respects, was synonymous with the word &lt;em&gt;sunagoge&lt;/em&gt; to mean an assembly and only later came to mean a gathering of gentile Christians and non-believing Jews, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laodicea is mentioned several times in Paul&amp;rsquo;s letter to the Colossians. Based on Col 1:7, a fair assumption is that Epaphras, an evangelist under Paul, founded churches at Colossae and at Hierapolis, and Laodicea. Col 4:15-16 instructs Colossae and Laodicea to exchange greetings and letters. Verse 16 also mentions that Paul wrote a letter to the Laodiceans that has since been lost (we can only wonder what it said given the later rebuke in Revelation…).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We don&amp;rsquo;t have any direct evidence that Paul himself visited there. Still, from Colossians 4, we can see that many of the &amp;ldquo;big names&amp;rdquo; of the early apostolic movement were known to Colossae, and presumably to Laodicea: Tychicus, who traveled with Paul extensively; John Mark, Barnabas, and Luke. Of course, John the Apostle likely knew them personally since he&amp;rsquo;s the one penning the letter and scholars believe all seven churches fell under John&amp;rsquo;s apostolic authority. This level of attention could attest to the fact that the population of believers was significant. Because the three cities were interconnected to some degree, a few scholars would see the situation of believers to be much the same in Colossae and Hierapolis as it was in Laodicea. Therefore, like the instruction to Colossae in Col 4:15-16, the letter to Laodicea may have been intended for all the wider believing communities.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verses 15-17, contain the darkest, most scathing rebuke of any of the seven letters. However, in true Jesus style, He doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave believers in that lost place but He desires to bring them back into the fold. Verse 18-20a tells us even though we may be lost, Jesus knows where we are. No matter how far we have wandered, He desires fellowship and restoration. However, He won&amp;rsquo;t violate our sovereignty. He makes the first move, but it is up to us to respond. Then the second part of verse 20 and verse 21 provides us the rewards of accepting His fellowship. We mention this, because like Sardis, there is some indication that, historically, the believers at Laodicea responded favorably. Although it didn&amp;rsquo;t last quite as long as Sardis and Philadelphia, the city lasted until the 13th century. Todd Bolen writes the following: &amp;quot; Some have suggested that Archippus, Philemon’s son (Philemon 2), was Laodicea’s pastor/bishop (cf. Colossians 4:17), based upon the 4th century Apostolic Constitutions. In the 4th century AD, Laodicea emerged as the prominent Christian center of the region of Phrygia and was the site of an important church council.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rev 3:14&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;To the angel of the Messianic Community in Laodicea, write: &amp;lsquo;Here is the message from the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the Ruler of God&amp;rsquo;s creation:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 1:1 In the beginning God created &amp;hellip; &lt;br&gt;Joh 1:1-3 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. (2) He was in the beginning with God. (3) All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.  &lt;br&gt;Isa 65:16 so that he who blesses himself in the land shall bless himself by the God of truth, and he who takes an oath in the land shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten and are hidden from my eyes. Deu 6:4 &amp;ldquo;Sh&amp;rsquo;m&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;, Yisra&amp;rsquo;el! Adonai Eloheinu, Adonai echa&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the description of the speaker, remember that the first five churches all had direct tie-ins to Revelation 1. For Philadelphia, we had a half reference to Revelation 1. Chapter 1 says &amp;ldquo;I have the keys of death and hades,&amp;rdquo; but Philadelphia was told, &amp;ldquo;the one…who has the key of David.&amp;rdquo; In Laodicea, we have zero direct references to Revelation chapter 1. This is a subtle clue that something is very different about this letter to the Laodiceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrew Lessons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amen Faithful and True:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;אמ&lt;/strong&gt;ן – it doesn’t just mean &amp;ldquo;the end&amp;rdquo; – in Hebrew it is a statement of affirmation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;נ&lt;strong&gt;אמ&lt;/strong&gt;ן – the faithful one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;אמ&lt;/strong&gt;ת - truth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Witness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/9b5f1709c4867dd89e0d75648a7be8e2.jpg&#34;  &gt;}}
In Hebrew, the word for witness is עד. In a Torah Scroll, when the famous Shema Israel is written, (&amp;ldquo;Hear O Israel, the LORD is our God, the LORD is one&amp;rdquo;) the final letters of &amp;ldquo;Hear&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;one&amp;rdquo; are enlarged. You can see a picture of a parchment copy of the Shema that I have. These enlarged letters are ע and ד, the word for &amp;ldquo;witness&amp;rdquo;. This reminds us that if we say, &amp;ldquo;The LORD is our God, the LORD is one,&amp;rdquo; our actions need to match our words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The believers in Laodicea were likely saying the Shema at least twice a day, and they were professing faith in Jesus, but their hearts and actions were far from Him. Strictly speaking, we are called to BE a witness. Witnessing is something we do, being a witness is who we are 24/7/365.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ִFinally, note the similarity between how the Hebrew translation of &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Ruler of God&amp;rsquo;s Creation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; compares with the first part of Genesis 1:1, &amp;ldquo;In the beginning, God Created.&amp;rdquo; They are only different by three letters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 3:14 - &lt;strong&gt;ראשית&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;בר&lt;/strong&gt;י&lt;strong&gt;א&lt;/strong&gt;ת ה&lt;strong&gt;אלהים&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:1 - ב&lt;strong&gt;ראשׁית&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ברא&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;אלהים&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Greek the word translated as beginning is &lt;em&gt;arche&lt;/em&gt; which means beginning, first origin, ruling power. We see this in words like &amp;ldquo;Archangel&amp;rdquo; or even &amp;ldquo;arch enemy.&amp;rdquo; This is not the first angel or enemy, but the supreme one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 3:15-16 &amp;ldquo;I know what you are doing: you are neither cold nor hot. How I wish you were either one or the other! (16) So, because you are lukewarm, neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of my mouth!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lev 18:24-25 “Do not make yourselves unclean by any of these things, for by all these the nations I am driving out before you have become unclean, (25) and the land became unclean so that I punished its iniquity, and the land vomited out its inhabitants.  &lt;br&gt;1Ki 18:20-21 So Ahab sent to all the people of Israel and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel. (21) And Elijah came near to all the people and said, “How long will you go limping between two different opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.” And the people did not answer him a word. &lt;br&gt;Jas 1:8 he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. &lt;br&gt;Mat 6:24 “No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sardis and Laodicea have no commendation. Later, we will look at how after the Fall, God sought out Adam. This is an example of standing at the door and knocking. It is also an example of &amp;ldquo;I know your works.&amp;rdquo; We cannot hide from God. Perhaps the Laodicean church had gotten so comfortable, they didn&amp;rsquo;t think they had a need to hide from God, but in fact they were far away. Let us never be complacent. As we&amp;rsquo;ve talked about, ask God to audit your works every so often. Make sure little errors don&amp;rsquo;t turn into big ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/701a67312121a85e19d6637c8a8e1851.jpg&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our culture, we use &amp;ldquo;hot&amp;rdquo; to mean spiritually hot, on fire for God. We use &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo; to mean distant and backslidden. In that context, &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo; would be the worst. Note that Jesus is saying cold is better than lukewarm. This is not referring to the spiritual temperature but the effectiveness of their works. Hot works are as soothing and healing as the medicinal hot springs from Hierapolis. Cold works are as refreshing and replenishing as the cold springs from Colossae. Aqueduct water in Laodicea arrived lukewarm, and because of the mineral content, it was distasteful and unusable. This would have been a vivid picture for the Laodiceans. The photo above shows the calcified water pipes, some of which are completely blocked.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; God can use &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;hot&amp;rdquo; works, but He can&amp;rsquo;t use the spiritually lukewarm. When we become so unclean as to be unusable, God has no choice but to vomit us out like He describes in Leviticus 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/4c49ddfb1142d8608d2909a233fc37ce.png&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Elijah might say, let us make sure we are not wavering between two opinions, and so becoming lukewarm. When we go to Mount Carmel, the setting for 1 Kings 18 pictured above&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, this is the challenge we give to our groups. Go all-in for God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who would argue salvation can be lost can&amp;rsquo;t see how Jesus/God spewing a professing believer out of His mouth can mean anything but a loss of salvation. Indeed, the warnings for the unrepentant or those who do not hold fast are alarming. An alternate view is that a loss of rewards, but not salvation is in view. One must admit that Jesus spewing out of His mouth sounds every bit as condemning as being cast out to where there is weeping or gnashing of teeth. Other verses would indicate that our salvation is secure. In this case, it is best to make sure we are abiding in God, and we don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, Jesus is using strong language to motivate the Laodiceans to change their ways. Jesus does this frequently in the Gospels. For example, in Matthew 16:23, He calls Peter &amp;ldquo;Satan.&amp;rdquo; In a sense, His sharp exchanges with the Pharisees where He uses similar provocative language (ex. Mat 23:27, John 8) could be an attempt to wake them up because He loves them, not because He hates them. Laodicea is a sheep that has wandered off. While there were assuredly non-believers in their midst, the true believers in Laodicea knew His voice and responded. He is calling to us too. A sheep can only serve one shepherd. We have a choice to make, and it&amp;rsquo;s not a one-time choice. It&amp;rsquo;s a moment-by-moment choice whether we will live for Him or live for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 3:17-18 For you keep saying, &amp;lsquo;I am rich, I have gotten rich, I don&amp;rsquo;t need a thing!&amp;rsquo; You don&amp;rsquo;t know that you are the one who is wretched, pitiable, poor, blind and naked! (18) My advice to you is to buy from me gold refined by fire, so that you may be rich; and white clothing, so that you may be dressed and not have to be ashamed of your nakedness; and eyesalve to rub on your eyes, so that you may see.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hos 12:6-8 “So you, by the help of your God, return, hold fast to love and justice, and wait continually for your God.” (7) A merchant, in whose hands are false balances, he loves to oppress. (8) Ephraim has said, “Ah, but I am rich; I have found wealth for myself; in all my labors they cannot find in me iniquity or sin.”  &lt;br&gt;Joh 15:5 I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest person to deceive is yourself. Those who are rich would see that as evidence of the blessing of God&amp;rsquo;s favor. It may be that, or it may be a situation where to whom much is given, much is asked. If God has granted us wealth, we should be using that for the kingdom, not for our comforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, this letter is not that much different from the first six letters. All the assemblies were being pressured to compromise. Some congregations fared better than others. Lizorkin states, &amp;ldquo;The kind of wealth and comfort mentioned here could only have been achieved if (the Laodicean&amp;rsquo;s) full participation in Pagan Roman society is presumed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern makes a great comment: &amp;ldquo;Yeshua here does not command but offers His advice. Being infinitely wise, he knows the Laodiceans are far too undisciplined to obey orders.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics point out that these verses aptly describe the 20th and 21st-century church, with its prosperity doctrine, in-house coffee stands, and comfy chairs with cupholders more fitting for a place of entertainment than a house of worship. Chuck Missler quips that the &amp;ldquo;name it and claim it&amp;rdquo; bunch ARE scriptural. Right here in Revelation 3:17, it says they are poor naked, and blind!&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hosea 12, Hosea is prophesying about the coming destruction of Ephraim, which is a euphemism for the Northern Kingdom. It&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that when a New Testament author alludes to an Old Testament passage, it&amp;rsquo;s not the specific verse that the author wants his reader to understand but the entire passage. In Hosea 12, God is talking about rebuking Ephraim and sending them back into the wilderness because of their lack of faith and on cleanliness in His eyes. The warning John alludes to from Hosea would have been abundantly clear to the believers in Laodicea. It should also be abundantly clear to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/76d6d79e2b38eea17e945537d28c2703.jpg&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the letter to Smyrna, Jesus says they are rich, even though they see themselves as poor (Rev 2:9). Here, the Laodiceans are opposites. They are poor, though they view themselves as wealthy. And not just poor but spiritually naked and utterly blind to their condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an indictment of wealth itself. We believe many of Jesus&amp;rsquo; disciples were wealthy, including Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathea, and the family of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus. Wealth can be a trap and can quickly become an idol in one&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether rich or poor, the solution is the same and is contained in verse 18. We need to acquire the type of gold that can&amp;rsquo;t be bought with money. We need to be clothed in His righteousness, and like the numerous blind people that Jesus healed, we need to have our spiritual blindness removed. His healings of physical blindness, particularly John 9:1-7, are juxtaposed against the nation&amp;rsquo;s spiritual blindness in the Gospels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these things are free, yet they cost everything. Jesus puts these in terms of financial transactions so they would resonate with worldly people. We are no different. We need to give up the things of this world and repent of our inherent unclean status. Therefore the Old Testament emphasizes what is clean vs. unclean. The more we realize what is unclean, the more this is a picture of us. We abide in Him and reject our way of doing things. He makes us clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in view is the context of honor and shame. The word in verse 18 should probably be rendered as &amp;ldquo;shame,&amp;rdquo; not &amp;ldquo;ashamed.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Honor and shame&amp;rdquo; were a very big deal in ancient societies. Part of how we know our society today is degrading is that the concept of shame is dwindling. In ancient times, honor was a positive and was highly prized. Shame is the opposite, negative social status that was to be avoided. The proverbs often speak of the righteous versus the wicked, clean versus unclean, and honor versus shameful. The Laodiceans were in the status of shamed. Ashamed is an emotion, but shame is a status.&lt;/p&gt;

(also quoted in Heb 12:6) &lt;br&gt;Jas 5:19-20 My brothers, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back, (20) let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from his wandering will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the secondary encouragement has a dark undertone. We have no &amp;ldquo;there are a few of you in Laodicea who have held fast&amp;rdquo; acknowledgment. Jesus must explain that His strong rebuke is an encouragement because He loves them. This is a plea to repent. Notice that everywhere in the Bible we are told to repent, there is a sense of urgency attached. A big warning sign would be when we say, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t need to repent&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not ready to repent.&amp;rdquo; Stern writes, &amp;ldquo;it takes effort to lift oneself out of apathy and turn from sin.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 19 is entirely in keeping with Romans 8:1. We are not being condemned if we are believers. As Proverbs 3:12 says, a loving parent would not let a child continue along the wrong path. To do so would not be loving. The fact that God rebukes the Laodiceans and occasionally must rebuke us is not an example of his hating us. He loves us and wants what&amp;rsquo;s best for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we are to be like James in leading someone who has wandered to return to God.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Proverbs 3:12 in Hebrew&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is something very interesting with the Hebrew of Proverbs 3:12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular Hebrew word order is verb-subject-object.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So if this were a typical sentence, it would read in Hebrew, &amp;ldquo;rebukes God the one He loves.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever there is a deviation from the normal pattern, it should get our attention. There is such a deviation here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The literal word order translation would be like, &amp;ldquo;the one He loves, God, he rebukes.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, LOVE is the action verb that is being stressed in the sentence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even though the main verb is technically &amp;ldquo;rebukes,&amp;rdquo; God wants to stress His love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular English word order is subject-verb-object.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Lord rebukes the one He loves&amp;rdquo; is a technically accurate translation but somehow misses the meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here we see God&amp;rsquo;s, parental heart.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No loving parent enjoys rebuking or punishing his or her child&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we want our children to mature, sometimes we have to do things we would prefer not to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the same way with God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes, he has to send unfaithful Ephraim back into the wilderness; sometimes, He has to do the same with us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True repentance means we don&amp;rsquo;t just give lip service and ask for forgiveness every time we sin. We are supposed to turn away from our old ways. Repentance is active, not passive. Fortunately for us, God&amp;rsquo;s pursuit is also active and not passive, as we see in verse 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-320&#34;&gt;Rev 3:20:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is outside knocking to be let in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Revelation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 3:20 Here, I&amp;rsquo;m standing at the door, knocking. If someone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he will eat with me.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 3:8-9 And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden. (9) But the LORD God called to the man and said to him, “Where are you?”  &lt;br&gt;Zec 1:1-4 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, son of Iddo, saying, (2) “The LORD was very angry with your fathers. (3) Therefore say to them, Thus declares the LORD of hosts: Return to me, says the LORD of hosts, and I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts. (4) Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets cried out, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, Return from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.’ But they did not hear or pay attention to me, declares the LORD. &lt;br&gt;Luk 22:28-30 “You are those who have stayed with me in my trials, (29) and I assign to you, as my Father assigned to me, a kingdom, (30) that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As J. Vernon McGee might say, &amp;ldquo;will you notice?&amp;rdquo; Will you notice that this church is so far off track that Jesus isn&amp;rsquo;t even allowed inside? He&amp;rsquo;s outside knocking to be let in. He is not willing that any should perish and extends the invitation for those who repent that they will let him in and then dine with him in the messianic banquet in the age to come. But for now, we must realize that any church that has Jesus outside knocking to get it could not be described as a &amp;ldquo;saved church.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is a beautiful invitation for anyone who needs renewed fellowship with our Master in a general context. In Jewish thought, mealtime, particularly a Shabbat dinner, is a time for profoundly intimate fellowship. It&amp;rsquo;s a time to be fully present with one another. That is the intimacy Jesus is offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we must understand that Jesus will meet with us, but He does so on His terms, not ours. It is so easy to make &amp;ldquo;our Jesus&amp;rdquo; into a god of our own making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is holy, and no compromise, contamination, or uncleanliness is allowed in His presence. He can make us clean, but we must choose not to compromise. We must be on our guard for errors in teaching, such as from the Nicolaitans, Balaam, or Jezebel. Those groups all made the same error: they believed and were taught that God conformed to their image. Therefore, we stress Acts 17:11. We need to be Bereans to make sure our image of God conforms to the Bible and is not something we&amp;rsquo;ve made up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, in Revelation, the topic of eating surfaces in contrast to those who have defiled themselves with worldly teachings. Whether the dietary laws have been abolished or not, I can guarantee you Yeshua&amp;rsquo;s messianic dinner will not have pork or shellfish. That gives me something to think about. Eating is essential to God. Would He change His mind on what we can and can&amp;rsquo;t eat, particularly given Acts 15? Not sure about that. I&amp;rsquo;m worried that the thought that we can eat whatever we want the same as the world does might be a false teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may think that repentance is a New Testament invention, but it goes back to the Garden. After Adam and Eve sinned, who went looking for them? Of course, it was God. He was there knocking. When Abraham was an idol-worshipping gentile in the Ur of the Chaldees, God was there knocking. When Jacob was utterly lost, God was there knocking. For the Israelites in the wilderness, for the people in Judges who were doing what was right in their own eyes, for David who in one night broke nearly every one of the Ten Commandments, for the Kings of Israel and Judah who were worshipping false gods along with the one true God, for the lost sheep of Israel, for you and me, God stands at the door and knocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 3:21-22 I will let him who wins the victory sit with me on my throne, just as I myself also won the victory and sat down with my Father on his throne. (22) Those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit is saying to the Messianic communities.&amp;rdquo; &amp;rsquo; &amp;quot;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Heb 4:14-16 Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. (15) For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. (16) Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.   &lt;br&gt;He who has an ear 7x in Revelation and 7x in the Gospels: Mat 11:15, Mat 13:9, Mat, 13:43; Mar 4:9, Mar 4:23, Luk 8:8, Luk 14:34  &lt;br&gt;1Jn 5:4-5 For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith. (5) Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?  &lt;br&gt;Joh_16:33 I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Victory in Jesus&amp;rdquo; has become a cliché phrase. I for one am guilty of giving lip service to being victorious but living my life like one who is defeated. I think many believers are like me. Part of the reason is, like the Laodiceans, we have our eyes on the wrong things. We are looking at the things of this world to provide peace and security. The great news is this outlook is a weakness we can lay at His feet and receive help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that He uses the term victory for Laodicea. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that the most victorious believers in our day are the ones who have come from the darkest places, and spiritually, Laodicea was in the darkest place of the seven assemblies. In Luke 7:46-47, Jesus says those who have been forgiven of much, love much, but those who have been forgiven little love little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of His victory, we can have true victory. Our church runs a program called &amp;ldquo;Celebrate Recovery&amp;rdquo; or CR for short. It&amp;rsquo;s not just for substance abuse but for anyone with a hurt, habit, or hang-up. Raise your hand if you have a hurt, habit, or hang-up. I was skeptical about CR at first, and there are still some things about it I&amp;rsquo;m not crazy about, but we can&amp;rsquo;t argue with the changed lives and the fact that once defeated believers are now victorious. We&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about how these seven letters are like getting an audit report. With every audit, there is what is called the remediation or corrective action phase. If through these letters, Jesus has revealed any behaviors that are interfering with our walk, then CR would be a great place to implement corrective action and come out living more victorious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reward for answering the knock on the door is absolutely staggering. We will sit with Him on His throne. We get to participate in the messianic kingdom in the age to come. However, being informed and giving intellectual assent is not enough. We must &amp;ldquo;Shema&amp;rdquo; these words. Believe and obey what the Spirit is saying to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we have the 7th and final time &amp;ldquo;He who has an ear&amp;rdquo; appears in Revelation. It also occurs seven times in the Gospels. What a &amp;ldquo;coincidence!&amp;rdquo; You can see the citations above. 1 John describes how to be an overcomer: believe that Jesus is the son of God. Of course, this means to believe in the Hebraic sense, not the Greek sense of merely giving intellectual assent. An overcomer lives his or her life knowing that we overcome by putting our trust in the One who has overcome the world. An overcomer doesn&amp;rsquo;t compromise. An overcomer doesn&amp;rsquo;t waver between two opinions. An overcomer doesn&amp;rsquo;t doubt His promises. Being an overcomer is not easy, but neither is it impossible. An overcomer makes a moment-by-moment choice to live for Him and deny himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Apostate&amp;rdquo; is a $10 word that means fallen away or renouncing a previous belief that one professes to have. We&amp;rsquo;ve talked about &amp;ldquo;Jews in name only&amp;rdquo; through these letters. The Apostate Church contains &amp;ldquo;Christians in name only.&amp;rdquo; In Matthew 15:18, Jesus quotes Isa 29:13 And the Lord said: “Because this people draw near with their mouth and honor me with their lips, while their hearts are far from me.&amp;rdquo; An apostate is not merely an unbeliever but one who is actively proclaiming destructive theology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a church that is conforming to the world&amp;rsquo;s image and pushing out God. This behavior was prophesied by Paul in 2Th 2:3 Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction.&amp;rdquo; The word the ESV uses for &amp;ldquo;rebellion&amp;rdquo; is &lt;em&gt;eapostasia&lt;/em&gt;. We may think of rebellion in the sense of unbelievers rebelling against God, but this could be a rebellion or falling away from &lt;strong&gt;within&lt;/strong&gt; the apostate church. See the callout box below for additional verses speaking of apostasy in the last days.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roots of our modern apostasy can be traced to the turn of the 20th century, particularly with the development of so-called &amp;ldquo;higher criticism&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;documentary hypothesis.&amp;rdquo; These philosophies denied the inerrancy of the Bible using German rationalist methods. These slowly began to infiltrate what we might call the mainline denominations, particularly the Presbyterian church by a guy named Charles Briggs who was a seminary professor at the Union theological Seminary. So we had a modernist liberal (in the Christian sense, not a political sense) in a prominent position now teaching future ministers who spread liberalism throughout their churches. This caused a great divide between so-called modernists and fundamentalists. If we are Southern Baptists, we can be proud to say that the SBC has generally rejected modernist thought, though not without a struggle.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:21&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The same cannot be said for just about every other major denomination. Rather than fight the apostasy, these churches stress &amp;ldquo;unity,&amp;rdquo; but it is unity with liberal tenets.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:22&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Again, it seems the very folks who preach tolerance are the most intolerant of you if you disagree with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/c3c08426bc3f498a879c2e0276149e5b.jpg&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Laodiceans were also wealthy and comfortable. Bolen writes, &amp;ldquo;as the city grew, so did the theater-hungry crowds. To supplement the outgrown Western Theater, the bigger and more expensive Northern Theater was built.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:23&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:23&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to many churches today is not much different than going to a rock concert. We have comfy chairs sometimes with cup holders, the theater is dark, except for the lights on the stage, the music is loud, there are smoke machines, and some even have a merch table in the lobby next to the coffee stand. A &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; service may be defined as one that emotionally stirred me. A &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; service is when the pastor preaches a sermon from the Word that challenges and makes me uncomfortable. Church programs are based on people what they want, not on what they need.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:24&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:24&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Fructenbaum quips, &amp;ldquo;Satan would not be a very good deceiver if he made one feel badly (sic), would he? Satan can give people joyful and happy experiences rather than the Word of God. (These experiences become) the final authority for determining spiritual truth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:25&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:25&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fructenbaum also pointed out that Paul of all people could easily have used his &amp;ldquo;experience&amp;rdquo; on the Damascus Road in his preaching as a tool for evangelism, but he did not. He always preached the Word of God and taught how Jesus was the fulfillment of the Scriptures. Personal testimonies are fantastic, but God&amp;rsquo;s word is the final authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend Dr. Dan Stolebarger recalls a dream he had once where Jesus was in the backseat of his car. Jesus asked, &amp;ldquo;Where are we going?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re going to church!&amp;rdquo; was the reply. &amp;ldquo;Ah, I see,&amp;rdquo; said Jesus. So they went inside to the service and came out about an hour later. &amp;ldquo;What was that again?&amp;rdquo; asked Jesus. &amp;ldquo;That was church!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Not what I had in mind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, our goal is not to be critical of others’ practices but more to look at areas in our lives where we are compromising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;parables-laodicea--dragnet-mat-1347-50&#34;&gt;Parables: Laodicea = Dragnet (Mat 13:47-50)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 13:47-50 “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind. (48) When it was full, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into containers but threw away the bad. (49) So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous (50) and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see the separation of the good and the bad (and note the good remain while the bad are thrown away). Jesus explains the parable in verses 49-50. Laodicea was given the opportunity to repent. Human nature tells us that likely only a small remnant did, while a vast majority went on their way and perished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;paul-laodicea--colossians&#34;&gt;Paul: Laodicea = Colossians&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter to the Colossians is a natural fit for Laodicea. As we&amp;rsquo;ve noted, the two were sister cities and in Colossians 4:16-17, the two cities are instructed to exchange letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 1:13 He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Colossians 1:15, we see a direct reference to Revelation 3:14: &amp;ldquo;He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 2:1-4 For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and for those at Laodicea and for all who have not seen me face to face, (2) that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, to reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of God&amp;rsquo;s mystery, which is Christ, (3) in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. (4) I say this in order that no one may delude you with plausible arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 2:8 See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 2:16 Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is usually taught that this verse is one that allows gentiles to eat anything, and it is &amp;ldquo;Judaizers&amp;rdquo; who are telling believers they must follow the Jewish law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In keeping with Acts 15:29 (the directives to gentile believers commanding them to stay avoid eating and behaving sexually like pagans) and the general Roman cult society in which the assembly at Colossae found themselves, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be just as likely that the mostly Jewish body was trying to the Jewish dietary laws, Rosh Chodesh (a minor holiday celebrating the first day of the month, which coincides with the arrival of the new moon), and keeping Shabbat in the face of opposition from the pagan majority?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, remember that to Paul, a Jew, pork and shellfish were not merely “unclean food”; to him, those were not “food” at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-read Colossians 2 in light of what we know about the seven churches and Laodicea specifically. Whose &amp;ldquo;regulations&amp;rdquo; in verse 20 is it more likely Paul was referring to? Instructions from God&amp;rsquo;s Word or the pagan world&amp;rsquo;s practices? Acts 17:11!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 2:23 These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion and asceticism and severity to the body, but they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 3:1-3 If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. (2) Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. (3) For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 3:5-6 Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. (6) On account of these, the wrath of God is coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 3:11 Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all, and in all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again, this is often taught that the Jewish believers said the Gentile believers had to be more Jewish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if it was the opposite? Overall in Colossae, the pagan population outnumbered Jews. What if it was the formerly pagan gentiles attempting to introduce non-Biblical practices into the Synagogue to blend in with society at large?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The church today has a generally condemning attitude towards Messianic Jews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 4:6 Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 4:11 and Jesus who is called Justus. These are the only men of the circumcision among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul&amp;rsquo;s use of &amp;ldquo;the circumcision&amp;rdquo; is not necessarily pejorative. It just means &amp;ldquo;Jewish.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 4:15-16 Give my greetings to the brothers at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house. (16) And when this letter has been read among you, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and see that you also read the letter from Laodicea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Colossians 4:17, Paul writes, &amp;ldquo;And say to Archippus, “See that you fulfill the ministry that you have received in the Lord.” There is a church tradition that Archippus later became the bishop of Laodicea. If so, the speculation is that his weakness, whatever it was that Paul saw as coming up short, contributed to their dire spiritual condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are a couple of interesting names mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 4:10 Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, and Mark the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you have received instructions—if he comes to you, welcome him),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare Act_15:39, And there arose a sharp disagreement so that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colossians was written after Acts 15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark was &amp;ldquo;redeemed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 4:14 Luke the beloved physician greets you, as does Demas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare 2 Ti 4:10 For Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colossians was written BEFORE 2 Timothy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demas, once a fellow worker (Phm 24), fell away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a confrontation with the religious leaders in Judea, Yeshua seeks a place where He can conduct His ministry in the safety of relative obscurity. We follow Him back to the Galilee, but not back to Nazareth. Instead, He goes to the north shore of Lake Galilee for a visit to CAPERNAUM, the town of Simon Peter. We visit the village synagogue and Simon Peter’s house. Local tradition identifies a cave overlooking the lake near Capernaum and Tabgha as the “secluded place” where Yeshua used to pray. He says that He must leave Capernaum to take the good news of the kingdom to other villages. He invites the fishermen to join Him on the journey, but He does most of His miracles and teaching along the north shore of the lake within ten miles of Capernaum.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In A PROPHET WITHOUT HONOR, we leave the village of Cana and follow Yeshua back to Nazareth to spend a quiet Shabbat in His hometown. The view from atop the Nazareth hill affords us a splendid view of the Jezreel Valley, Mount Tabor, and the surrounding territory. Take a walk around town and take in the sights as the shops close and people prepare for Sabbath. This is where our Master grew up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 1: John 4

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 2: Luke 4

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3EBTwb24T9E&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue in John 4, where the woman has left her waterpot at Jesus&amp;rsquo; feet as she ran back into town, claiming to have met someone who knows all about her. The disciples returned with food and were curious as to why Jesus was speaking alone with a Samaritan woman, but no one said anything. A talmid’s job is to model and imitate his rav/teacher, so I’m sure the disciples were wondering how far they were supposed to take this “interaction with Samaritans” thing. Jesus will tell them once we get to Luke 10. Everyone is our neighbor, and we’re supposed to love our neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this mini discourse on food, Jesus will stay in Samaria for a couple of days and then head back to Nazareth. We’ll pick up the narrative in Luke 4, where He is asked to teach on Shabbat in Nazareth. He proclaims Himself the Messiah, which signals a transition from a private to a public phase of His ministry. The people of Nazareth reject this as blasphemy. He somehow avoids a mob that wants to stone him and relocates to Capernaum to launch his public Galilean ministry. What happens there will fulfill the saying, “A prophet is without honor in his hometown.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have one more episode in what we categorize as Jesus’ “early ministry.” Next time, we will pick up John 5 in Jerusalem; after this, we’ll return to Capernaum and formally enter the next phase of Jesus’ earthly ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:4.125in;height:5.83333in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.06528in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schlaegel, in his supplemental study guide for the Satellite Bible Atlas, writes, “Neither war nor diplomacy over hundreds of years was able to break down the barriers between Jews and Samaritans. The Gospel of Jesus Christ did. Many Samaritans in the city believed in him (John 4:39-42).”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we say this period closes Jesus’ private ministry, Jesus had been growing in popularity when He returned to Galilee. Word of His private miracles was spreading and many people reported what Jesus had been doing in Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an official from Capernaum heard that Jesus had returned to Galilee, he came up to Cana to plead with Jesus to heal his son. With a word, Jesus healed the boy from some 18 miles away. After this, or perhaps immediately before this, Jesus is in Nazareth, where He is rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-431-34&#34;&gt;John 4:31-34&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the disciples urged Him, saying, “Rabbi, eat something.” But He said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.” So the disciples were saying to one another, “No one brought Him anything to eat, did he?” Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to accomplish His work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see, perhaps, a paradox. We opened John 4 with Jesus being tired and thirsty – we noted that ministry could be exhausting. While we can get exhausted by the ministry, it can also be incredibly nourishing and fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must recall His statement in the wilderness: “Man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:4.45161in;height:5.93548in&#34; alt=&#34;A picture containing person, cooking, meal, grill Description automatically generated&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:3.8735in;height:3.77501in&#34; alt=&#34;A person sitting at a table Description automatically generated with medium confidence&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image5.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.32153in&#34; alt=&#34;A picture containing person, dining table Description automatically generated&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These photos are from a demonstration of 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century food preparation techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One good suggestion is that when Jesus is on the Father’s mission, He is just as nourished and strengthened as if he had literal food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we go on mission trips, we start with the intent to bless others (and hopefully that does happen), but most of us return feeling like we were the ones blessed and spiritually nourished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus makes statements like, “do the will of Him who sent me to accomplish His work,” we tend to see this as His work on the Cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is correct. Jesus will ultimately accomplish His Father’s work on the Cross – “It is finished” could be translated as “it is fulfilled” or “it is accomplished.” Tetelestai means “paid in full.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do need to keep the context in mind, however. He has not yet said anything about going to the Cross, so his Talmidim would not have interpreted Jesus’ statement as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the near term, the Father’s Work includes Jesus’ teaching, healing, compassion, and breaking down barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the talmidim are a picture of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Samaritan woman misunderstands His comment about water and she just met him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talmidim have been with Him for months now, and they are still misunderstanding him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the fun of our Christian walk is that we will never have Jesus completely figured out this side of Heaven. Every time we open His word, there is usually a new insight or aspect to Jesus we may not have noticed before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, Food and water are metaphors for spiritual truth&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water speaks of the need for salvation and regeneration in the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food represents doing the will of God – in other words, everything that comes after the moment of initial regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-435-38&#34;&gt;John 4:35-38&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you not say, ‘There are still four months, and then comes the harvest’? Behold, I tell you, raise your eyes and observe the fields, that they are white for harvest. “Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life, so that the one who sows and the one who reaps may rejoice together. “For in this case the saying is true: ‘One sows and another reaps.’ “I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have come into their labor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We harvest grain so we can have literal food; we sow and reap the Kingdom for spiritual nourishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Still four months until the harvest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some see this as Jesus literally saying there are only four months until the harvest, and therefore this episode takes place in late December or early January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be an odd time of year for a trip through the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so, it pokes a huge hole in the “heat of the day” argument about the woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, who often used crop and harvest metaphors, may have been quoting a regional proverb not otherwise known to us today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, we have the proverb, “April showers bring May flowers.” This could refer to literal rain in the month of April, resulting in literal flowers, or the general truism that every action has a reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus may be saying something like, “these fields of Samaria look bare to you because of your prejudice. You don’t see the Samaritans as worth saving. From my perspective, they are ripe for harvest. For God so loved the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lift up your eyes” often has a negative connotation in Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Jesus is turning it around to possibly suggest His talmidim are blind to the mission field right in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there was a sense among the talmidim that the time for harvest was not upon them – the sense that the harvest will only immediately precede the Messianic Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they did not consider Samaritans as being eligible for harvest into the Kingdom. They are unreachable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there “no go zones” in your ministry? By your words you may say there aren’t, but do your actions suggest certain people are unreachable for the Gospel? Be honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fields white for harvest could refer to the Samaritans approaching in their white robes – even today, the Samaritan priests typically wear white, with colors reserved for those in leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibly, Jesus could be saying, “I sowed in the Samaritan woman, and she sowed in her town – we did the heavy lifting; now you take over.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster’s explanation:&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sower = John the Baptist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaper = Jesus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers – the Talmidim&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time of the harvest = the present moment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fields are ripe = some are ready to receive the kingdom (such as the Samaritans here)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning: The harvest of souls for the kingdom begins now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-439&#34;&gt;John 4:39&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now from that city many of the Samaritans believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified, “He told me all the things that I have done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked about this last lesson but just to make the point again- if someone had just exposed every bad thing a person ever did, would you drop everything to meet that person, or would you run in the opposite direction for fear He might expose your sins next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chosen,&lt;/em&gt; while still implying she was a morally fallen woman, handled this passage very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the woman’s supposed snootiness or Jesus supposed sternness that most commentators love to imply was happening came through in their presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest we focus on Jesus’ love and compassion, and the woman’s restoration. And, of course, the disciples’ amazement that Samaritans are part of the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forget who said it but there’s a quip, “when you get to heaven, you will be surprised to see some people there who you thought were beyond God’s reach. Some people from your past may be surprised to see you for the same reason.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one is beyond God’s reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-440-42&#34;&gt;John 4:40-42&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when the Samaritans came to Jesus, they were asking Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days. Many more believed because of His word; and they were saying to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves and know that this One truly is the Savior of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Savior of the world” was a term used by Roman emperors to speak of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the sources of tension, and one that would continue after Jesus’ time, is the Samaritans tended to be pro-Roman against the Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like Herodium, the palace of the false king of the Jews was only a few miles from Bethlehem, the birthplace of the real king of the Jews; just a few miles from Jacob’s well was a temple to Augustus, “savior of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those Samaritans with open eyes, Jesus, not Augustus, was the true savior of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-443-45&#34;&gt;John 4:43-45&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image6.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:4.37129in;height:3.04496in&#34; alt=&#34;A picture containing outdoor, sky, nature, grass Description automatically generated&#34; /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after the two days, He departed from there for Galilee. For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country. So when He came to Galilee, the Galileans received Him, only because they had seen all the things that He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they themselves also went to the feast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could read the first four verses of chapter four and come away with the impression Jesus was in a hurry to get to Galilee. We find here that is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot going on here that is not stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purity customs (not from the Torah but man’s traditions) said that Jews and Samaritans considered each other unclean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With whom one lodged and dined was a BIG DEAL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be called a Rosa Parks moment in Jesus’ ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although all four Gospels use the phrase, “A prophet without honor,” the synoptics use it in reference to Nazareth, while John uses it in reference to Judea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of John’s macro-narratives is Jesus’ rejection by the Jewish leadership – the very ones who should have authenticated Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some commentators make a point that here and in verse 46, it says “He” and not “they” –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the implication is that the disciples went on ahead, possibly because they couldn’t stomach (literally and figuratively) dining with Samaritans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a speculation that I don’t necessarily see but I can’t rule out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t know for sure that Jesus was left behind, but if He was, there could have been any number of reasons why. We aren’t told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we’re following a strict chronology, the disciples have not yet been called to full-time ministry, so perhaps many of the disciples had jobs and families to attend to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-446-49&#34;&gt;John 4:46-49&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore He came again to Cana of Galilee, where He had made the water into wine. And there was a royal official whose son was sick at Capernaum. When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and began asking Him to come down and heal his son; for he was at the point of death. Then Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you simply will not believe.” The royal official said to Him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is evidently trying to keep a low profile but His fame is spreading. People who went to the Passover in Jerusalem came back with stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy for us to say something like, “the Jews rejected their messiah.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationally, this is true and certainly, the Jewish establishment rejected Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Jesus was WILDLY POPULAR among the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, some of these were fair-weather fans only; some were followers and some were actually disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons the establishment wanted Jesus taken out was because of his popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The royal official is unnamed but appears to be someone in Antipas’ administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we move through Jesus’ ministry, take a note of who is and is not Jewish; this is important to understanding Jesus’ messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This official appears to be Jewish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, someone who was with Jesus in Judea went back to Capernaum and told the official what he needed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial rebuff is reminiscent of Jesus’ words to Mary in John 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public phase of His ministry has not yet started; not officially, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus uses the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; person plural in His rebuff, so perhaps the remark is not directed to the official but more to the people who wanted some entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-450-54&#34;&gt;John 4:50-54&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to him, “Go; your son is alive.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went home. And as he was now going down, his slaves met him, saying that his son was alive. So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. Then they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.” So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, “Your son is alive”; and he himself believed, and his entire household. This is again a second sign that Jesus performed when He had come from Judea into Galilee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-distance miracles suggest extraordinary power. “Jesus’ only prerequisite for such miracles is the seeker’s faith in His power.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commentators note that this story sounds similar to the healing of the Centurian’s servant in Luke 7. While some suggest the two events are one and the same, there are enough differences in the two narratives to suggest two separate healings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 54: “ this was a second time that Jesus came from Judea to the Galilee and performed a miracle.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John is obviously linking us back to John 2:11 and the first miracle at Cana.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-413-15&#34;&gt;Luke 4:13-15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so when the devil had finished every temptation, he left Him until an opportune time. And Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about Him spread through all the surrounding region. And He began teaching in their synagogues and was praised by all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke places the Nazareth event immediately after Jesus’ temptation in the Wilderness, though possibly an entire year elapsed between the Wilderness and Nazareth.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Was praised by all” is going to serve as a contrast to his reaction in Nazareth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He regularly attended synagogue services and taught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 16 is going to say, “as was His custom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hebrews 10:24 reminds us not to forsake the gathering together of believers. Jesus modeled this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did not come to dismantle synagogue services or Judaism but to bring a course correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster notes that 1st-century synagogues, unlike Jewish and Christian congregations today, did not have a single permanent teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any competent teacher in the community or visiting rabbi might be asked to offer a Sabbath teaching.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-416&#34;&gt;Luke 4:16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mat 13:54&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark 6:1-2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luke 4:16&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And He came to His hometown and began teaching them in their synagogue, with the result that they were astonished, and said, “Where did this man acquire this wisdom and these miraculous powers?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jesus went out from there and came into His hometown; and His disciples followed Him. And when the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue; and the many listeners were astonished, saying, “Where did this Man learn these things, and what is this wisdom that has been given to Him, and such miracles as these performed by His hands?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16 And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up; and as was His custom, He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath, and stood up to read.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew, if he’s attempting to be chronological, has it roughly halfway through His gospel (but He’s probably not attempting to be chronological).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some reconciliations would see a second visit to Nazareth – the first recorded by Luke and the second by Matthew and Mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Luke was likely referencing Matthew and Mark (at least Mark) as he wrote, along with his own interviews and research, a single visit early in Jesus’ ministry seems more probable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe the residents of Nazareth were all descendants of David; if so, it makes their subsequent rejection all the more puzzling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nazareth means “branch town,” from Isaiah 11:1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 11:1-2 Then a shoot will spring from the stem of Jesse, And a Branch from his roots will bear fruit. [2] The Spirit of the LORD will rest on Him, The spirit of wisdom and understanding, The spirit of counsel and strength, The spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a decidedly messianic prophecy; in other words, the entire town was founded on the hope that the Messiah would one day come from Nazareth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet when that time came, they rejected the notion that one of their own could be the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’re criticizing them (justifiably so) let us examine ourselves; would we have been any different?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-417-20&#34;&gt;Luke 4:17-20&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image7.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.875in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the scroll of Isaiah the prophet was handed to Him. And He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written: “THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME, BECAUSE HE ANOINTED ME TO BRING GOOD NEWS TO THE POOR. HE HAS SENT ME TO PROCLAIM RELEASE TO CAPTIVES, AND RECOVERY OF SIGHT TO THE BLIND, TO SET FREE THOSE WHO ARE OPPRESSED, TO PROCLAIM THE FAVORABLE YEAR OF THE LORD.” And He rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down; and the eyes of all the people in the synagogue were intently directed at Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 61:1-2 The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, Because the LORD anointed me To bring good news to the humble; He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, To proclaim release to captives And freedom to prisoners; To proclaim the favorable year of the LORD &lt;strong&gt;And the day of vengeance of our God;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone in attendance would have had Isaiah 61 memorized; it would have been conspicuous for him to leave out, “and the day of vengeance of our God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? In retrospect, we can see that in His first coming, He did not come to condemn the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If He had said, “the day of vengeance of our God,” He could not have said, “today, this scripture has been fulfilled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audience in that day would not yet have been able to make that conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless He explained why He left out the verse (as He does in The Chosen’s approach to the scene), the audience might have been &lt;em&gt;momentarily&lt;/em&gt; wondering why He did this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any concerns were about to be overshadowed by what He WOULD say next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image7.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.875in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torah reading in Synagogues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synagogue tradition today is to read through the Torah in one Jewish year (50-54 weeks); however, we don’t know if this was the case 2000 years ago. Some suggest they were on a three-year cycle. After the Torah was read, a portion from the Prophets and Writings called the Haftarah was read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was reading the Haftarah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that day, the lecturer stood to read the Torah and Haftarah, then sat to teach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know the Sabbath service in the first century included the above three elements (&lt;em&gt;Torah, haftarah, derashah).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 13:15 After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue officials sent word to them, saying, “Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is not recorded, Messianic commentators assume Jesus also read the designated Torah portion that Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not know whether He picked Isaiah or whether it was assigned to Him&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In modern Torah reading annual cycles, the Haftara portion is assigned and is the same for that week’s portion every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t know whether this was the case in Jesus’ day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We suspect either way it was not a surprise to Him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each section of the Isaiah passage is rich with Messianic overtones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, “the acceptable/favorable year of the LORD” appears to be a reference to the year of Jubilee. A year the slaves were set free, debts were cancelled and leased property reverted back to its owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus came to cancel our spiritual debts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-421&#34;&gt;Luke 4:21&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now He began to say to them, “Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He possibly had part of a longer message where He either began or ended with our verse 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s unquestionably claiming to be the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t miss that we’ve just entered new territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lesson could just as easily have been the opening of Jesus’ public Galilean ministry as the close of His private early ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t quite sure where John 5 falls in the chronology, so we’ll cover that next time and group in with His early ministry. That chapter is John’s version of Jesus’ transition from private missions to publicly declaring who He is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;55 “Is this not the carpenter’s son? Is His mother not called Mary, and His brothers, James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;56 “And His sisters, are they not all with us? Where then did this Man acquire all these things?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;57 And they took offense at Him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not dishonored except in his hometown and in his own household.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;58 And He did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 “Is this not the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And are His sisters not here with us?” And they took offense at Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not dishonored except in his hometown and among his own relatives, and in his own household.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 And He could not do any miracle there except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 And He was amazed at their unbelief. And He was going around the villages, teaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And all the people were speaking well of Him, and admiring the gracious words which were coming from His lips; and yet they were saying, “Is this not Joseph’s son?” And He said to them, “No doubt you will quote this proverb to Me: ‘Physician, heal yourself! All the miracles that we heard were done in Capernaum, do here in Your hometown as well.’” But He said, “Truly I say to you, no prophet is welcome in his hometown.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked about whether the turning of the money changer’s tables in the Temple in John was the first of two or whether it only happened at the end of his ministry but John placed it early for a specific reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One argument in favor of there only being one event is that it might be unlikely for Jesus to “poke the bear” that early in His ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my view, NOW He’s about to “poke the bear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this instant, they are probably hanging on his every word but they still are inclined to view Him favorably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s about to change and He knows it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fairness, we don’t know with certainty if the people in the audience entirely turned on Him or if there was a mix of supporters and detractors. The latter seems more likely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If count carefully, there are seven different reactions recorded across the three Gospels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where did this man get these things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s this wisdom that has been given Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where did this man get the power to do miracles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this not Joseph’s son?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this not the carpenter (himself)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this not Mary’s son and his brothers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are not his sisters here with us? (testimony of women?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first three questions are positive/accepting; the last three are negative/dismissive of His abilities.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One might expect this Davidic clan living in the hope of a hometown Messiah to be the first to acclaim that their own Yeshua son of Joseph as Messiah. On the contrary…He was just good-old Yeshua, the carpenter’s son.” Lancaster.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David was also rejected/dismissed by his father and brothers. “When Samuel anointed David, Jesse and David’s brothers were stunned.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heal-thyself&#34;&gt;Heal Thyself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same maxim is quoted in the Jewish Midrash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means “prove your claims.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jesus-family&#34;&gt;Jesus’ family&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We speculate that Joseph has since died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had Joseph remained alive, Jesus (given His obvious skills as demonstrated when He was 12) might have been able to complete Beit Midrash and Beit Talmud to study under a prominent Sage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is, out of necessity and as the firstborn, He likely had to assume the role of family provider, which meant taking over His father’s carpentry/masonry business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, that’s all the townfolk saw Him as.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Matthew 13, Jesus was the oldest of at least seven children (Jesus, four brothers, and at least two sisters).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to preserve the tradition of Mary’s perpetual virginity, some suggest that the other children are children of Joseph by another wife or are actually cousins, not siblings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving tradition aside, reading all as children of Mary, with everyone after Jesus conceived in the usual manner, is supported by a plain reading of the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The names provided are all common Jewish names, and ones that are shared by several disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 7:5 helps us out a little as we’re told none of Jesus’s brothers believed in Him until after the resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have evidence suggesting James (Yakov in Hebrew) was a Pharisee. If so, James had the opportunity for formal schooling that Jesus did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the resurrection, James became the head of the Jerusalem assembly of believers, even to the point of having apostolic authority over the original disciples (including Peter, which must have been a fascinating dynamic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He appears to be well-regarded, even among the non-messianic Jews. He has the nickname James the Just, or we might say James the Righteous/Tzadik. The only way he would have earned this nickname is from strict Torah observance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This James is the author of the book of James and should not be confused with the two Apostles named James (James the Less (Mark 15:40) or James son of Alphaeus (Matthew 10:3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judas (Jude)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this is not the same as Judas who betrayed Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ brother Judas authored the book we know as Jude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon and Joseph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Simon is not Peter nor Simon the Zealot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Joseph is not the Joses mentioned in Mark 15:40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church tradition ascribes varying roles to Jesus’ brothers and sisters, but we have no other corroborating documentation to either support or refute this tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-425-28&#34;&gt;Luke 4:25-28&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25 “But I say to you in truth, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, when a severe famine came over all the land;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;26 and yet Elijah was sent to none of them, but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27 “And there were many with leprosy in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;28 And all the people in the synagogue were filled with rage as they heard these things;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus quotes a couple of miracles performed by Elijah and Elisha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Kings 17:9 “Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and stay there; behold, I have commanded a widow there to provide food for you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Kings 5:14 So (Naaman) went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, in accordance with the word of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is an entertaining story and worth our study. 2 Kings 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may not see what the big deal is, but as Chuck Missler liked to say, whenever you and I are in danger of missing something, the people come to our rescue. They are enraged and it’s our task to find out why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some commentators see the problem is he’s mentioning the socially weak and marginalized, which offended the sensibilities of the town. That’s not it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s saying, actually prophesying, that Gentiles receive the things of God and Jews do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just as Elijah and Elisha did not heal everyone, neither did Jesus heal everyone who needed it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some commentators interpret this as Jesus casting off Jews and Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably know me well enough by now to realize that, in my humble opinion, this is not how to read this passage appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire focus of the upcoming segment of His ministry is going to be to the Jews and ONLY the Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will tell His disciples, “do NOT go in way of the gentiles…rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel” (Matthew 10-5-6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All He’s doing here is explaining that He will leave Nazareth and take His ministry elsewhere; specifically, He will take it to the JEWISH town of Capernaum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What He WAS doing was comparing Himself to two of Israel’s greatest prophets, and in so doing, comparing Nazareth to the likes of idolatrous Ahab and Jezebel, who rejected and tried to kill the prophets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rough paraphrase might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surely some of you will tell Me to prove my claims of being Messiah by the signs and miracles you have heard me do in other places. Just as Elisha and Elijah did not do these miracles for everybody, you Nazarenes are not worthy of My miracles. I’m out.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-429-30&#34;&gt;Luke 4:29-30&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and they got up and drove Him out of the city, and brought Him to the crest of the hill on which their city had been built, so that they could throw Him down from the cliff. But He passed through their midst and went on His way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image8.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.87361in&#34; alt=&#34;A picture containing outdoor, mountain, sky, nature Description automatically generated&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, even when Jews had the power of capital punishment (which at this time they did not) Jewish law required order and due process to criminal proceedings, particularly for a capital crime, such as blasphemy – and there is no chance an execution would have been allowed on Shabbat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of a lawless, nearly out of control mob, the Chosen elected to portray this scene as people serious about the Torah and about the Laws of Blasphemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chief Rabbi asked repeatedly for Jesus to recount His so-called “blasphemy”; When Jesus did not, the rabbi felt He had no choice under the law of Moses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I had always viewed it as an out-of-control mob I appreciated the lesson in keeping our options open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to revise my notes for this section after I watched the episode in Season 3. I’m Ok with that. I still lean towards the out-of-control mob angle, but I can entertain the other possibility too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should always be ready to update our conclusions when indicated. That’s being a good Berean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a coworker who liked to say, “we always reserve the right to get smarter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a Berean does not mean you have to accept everything anyone says, however. It has to fit Scripture and it has to fit the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as to avoid cruel and unusual punishment, the condemned would often be thrown from a cliff, with the thought that the numerous jagged rocks would at least render him unconscious, with the stones then thrown to finish him off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They would aim for the chest, not the head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the fall alone killed the person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was not necessarily the altitude of the fall but the fact one would lose his balance and be very likely to hit his head on a rock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that day, Nazareth was MUCH smaller than it is today; a walk to either the northern hill or far less likely the southern hill would have been a hike on a Sabbath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The southern hill is “venerated” by tour companies because it’s a low-hassle stop without going through Nazareth on the way to Capernaum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The views of the Jezreel valley are a spectacular place to remember Jesus’ declaration and remember the OT events in the historical books that happened right in front of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We presume it was something supernatural that saved Him but remember, He did no miracles there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could have been His poise or his attitude that silenced them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or He potentially had to tussle His way through the crowd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, His hour had not yet come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope for Nazareth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years following His resurrection, the people of Nazareth became fervent believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His brothers became leaders in the early Messianic Jewish movement and Nazareth appears to have been a center for Jewish believers.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even today, the Modern Hebrew word for “Christians” is “notzrim.” “Nazarenes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;13 and leaving Nazareth, He came and settled in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 This happened so that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 “THE LAND OF ZEBULUN AND THE LAND OF NAPHTALI, BY THE WAY OF THE SEA, ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE JORDAN, GALILEE OF THE GENTILES—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SITTING IN DARKNESS SAW A GREAT LIGHT, AND THOSE WHO WERE SITTING IN THE LAND AND SHADOW OF DEATH, UPON THEM A LIGHT DAWNED.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;31 And He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee; and He was teaching them on the Sabbath;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will pick this up two lessons from now when we get to Capernaum and Jesus public ministry. Next time we’ll have one more lesson in the “early ministry” category. John 5 and the Pools of Bethesda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;genesis-13&#34;&gt;Genesis 13&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 13 begins with Abraham returning to Bethel/Ai, where Abraham again worships the LORD at the altar he made previously. This is represented by the blue arrow pointing up to Bethel on the map.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this region, the Canaanites were the primary inhabitants of the land, yet Abram and Lot both had accumulated large herds that needed food and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two camps got into a turf battle, leading Abram to suggest the two separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram selflessly elects to defer to Lot, who lifts his eyes towards Sodom and departs. Lot’s movements are represented by the orange arrow and box #3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God honors Abram’s handling of this situation by reaffirming his promise. Abram then moves south to dwell in Hebron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:4.76449in;height:4.35019in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;genesis-14&#34;&gt;Genesis 14&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five kings of Canaan evidently violate a Suzerain-Vassel relationship, which leads to four kings of Mesopotamia moving into the Promised land to make war. We’ll describe what a Suzerain-Vassal treaty is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown on the map,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the kings move from north to south along the King’s Highway and are victorious over the Rephaim, Zuzim, Emim (two possible locations), and the Horites in the region of Sier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this leads up to the main narrative that as the Mesopotamians are plundering the region, they capture Lot with the intention of deporting him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram is Lot’s kinsman redeemer and thus is obligated to rescue him, which he does way up in the region of Dan (off the map to the north).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his return from rescuing Lot, on his way back to Hebron, Abram meets Melchi-zedek (King of Righteousness) at Salem (Jerusalem).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.27986in;height:9in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-131-4&#34;&gt;Genesis 13:1-4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negeb. Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. And he journeyed on from the Negeb as far as Bethel to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, to the place where he had made an altar at the first. And there Abram called upon the name of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we are reminded that in Genesis 12:1, Abram was supposed to go from his kindred and his father’s house. He certainly had other humans besides his wife with him but the Bible specifically tells us Lot was one of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word for “rich” in Hebrew (&lt;em&gt;caveyd, &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;כָּבֵד&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; literally means to “be weighty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Livestock, silver, and gold weigh quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a hint that riches can weigh us down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would have been around 200 miles but it was a very slow journey; if nothing else the livestock would need time to pasture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to Abram’s next test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-135-7-abrams-and-lots-men-quarrel&#34;&gt;Genesis 13:5-7: Abram’s and Lot’s men quarrel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents, so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together, and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram&amp;rsquo;s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot&amp;rsquo;s livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between April and October, rain is almost non-existent in most parts of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible also reminds us that the land Abram and Lot were in is not their own. Those wicked Canaanites, whom Noah cursed back in Genesis 9 are the primary residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not too hard to envision them tripping over each other trying to find the scarce fields and streams for their animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past 4000 years, the main source of contention in the Holy Land is water rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often think that more money is the answer, but “will you notice”…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible clearly links their large quantity of posessions with the interpersonal strife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know what happens to most Lottery jackpot winners, you probably wouldn’t wish that on your worst enemy, let alone wish it would happen to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-138-9-abram-and-lot-separate&#34;&gt;Genesis 13:8-9: Abram and Lot Separate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abram said to Lot, “Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are kinsmen. Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram passes this mini test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His age and status give him the first choice; the natural response would be to assert that right and take the best land for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram shows faith in God by letting Lot go first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, we should put others first and rely on God to meet our needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster: “Peace between brothers is more important than success or prestige.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-4&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-5&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1310-11&#34;&gt;Genesis 13:10-11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar. (This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan Valley, and Lot journeyed east. Thus they separated from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We again see the sin progression from Genesis 3 with the serpent and Eve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lot saw, he wanted, he took.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, practically, the Jordan may have been the only water around. In fact, it was like the garden of Eden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible is conspicuous that faith comes by hearing. People hear the word of the Lord and very few saw the Lord personally with their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John 20:29 Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How often do we make decisions based on what we see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cars, houses, investments, food?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we see should be part of the decision-making process; not the entirety of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-6&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-7&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1312-13&#34;&gt;Genesis 13:12-13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom. Now the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram remains in the land of Canaan where God told him to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s bad enough that Lot found Sodom appealing, but he subjects his family to that environment. We’re going to see in a few chapters an example of sowing and reaping. His daughters are not going to turn out to be model citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As parents, and especially fathers, we’re responsible for the environment we expose to our children. I’m thinking specifically about government schools that don’t simply teach things differently than how you would want them; if you are a Bible-believing parent with traditional values, you are their enemy and they are your enemy. You’re leaving your kids with your enemy for 8 hours a day. You’re dropping your kids off at Sodom Jr. High. It’s something to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you and I interact with biblical characters, we should ask ourselves how are we like Abraham and how are we like Lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lot is portrayed as selfish, worldly. He makes bad decision after bad decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, we will see in Chapter 14, that his redeemer pursues him when he is in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after this redemption, he makes more bad decisions and moves BACK to Sodom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately Lot is declared “righteous.” I would say this is true not because of who Lot was, but because of who Lot associated with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-9&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1314-16&#34;&gt;Genesis 13:14-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, “Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward, for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever. I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God blesses Abram’s passing of the test by reconfirming the covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He chose to elevate his neighbor over his personal prosperity. At its core, this is the definition of honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, God blessed Him with BOTH peace and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a further illustration, Lot acted selfishly and chose what appealed to the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a few chapters that prized location will be destroyed and turned into the wasteland we see today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this illustrates Jesus’ words: Matthew 25:29 “For to everyone who has (i.e., a heart for God like Abram) will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not (i.e., a selfish heart like Lot), even what he has will be taken away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t know how much time has passed since Genesis 12:3 but safe to say several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram may be wondering about that “offspring” thing since he is still childless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see this as God telling him to hang in there, continue to be faithful and wait on God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Abraham’s ultimate offspring is Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Galatians 3:16 Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, “And to offsprings,” referring to many, but referring to one, “And to your offspring,” who is Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-10&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-11&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1317-18&#34;&gt;Genesis 13:17-18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arise, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.” So Abram moved his tent and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron, and there he built an altar to the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In faithfulness, Abram builds an altar. We can tell when he’s passed a test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebron is about halfway between Jerusalem and Beersheba; it’s only 19 miles from Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram will later be buried in Hebron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-12&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-13&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-141-4&#34;&gt;Genesis 14:1-4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, these kings made war with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar). And all these joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea). Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to admit that there is no extra-biblical support for this passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, there is no record that the four kings of the east had any control over the Holy Land during the early 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; millennium BC at the time of Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean the Bible is wrong; in fact, it is more likely that there are gaps in our knowledge of the history of this period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, what is being described is a suzerain-vassal relationship, which is entirely consistent with how things worked in ancient society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s basically a protection racket&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A weaker king (the vassal) pays tribute to a stronger king (the suzerain) in exchange for protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then what would happen is a third party make a threat. The vassal would threaten to call the suzrain, but the new guy says, “pay me tribute then I’ll protect you from the other guy when he comes to collect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also was not uncommon for the vassal to get tired of the whole arrangement and rebel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was very common for the suzrain to not take it well whenever the vassal revolted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations according to Walton (modern names)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elam = a province in lower Mesopotamia = Babylon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goiim = the gentile nations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim, and the Horites in their hill country of Seir as far as El-paran on the border of the wilderness. Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh) and defeated all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who were dwelling in Hazazon-tamar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible loves geography: they’re following the King’s Highway in Jordan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the land of the giants (Rephaim), so there may be more going on here than we realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deuteronomy 2:20-21 (It is also counted as a land of Rephaim. Rephaim formerly lived there—but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim— [21] a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim; but the LORD destroyed them before the Ammonites, and they dispossessed them and settled in their place. (Read all of Deuteronomy 2).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-148-11-the-babylonians-are-victorious&#34;&gt;Genesis 14:8-11: the Babylonians are victorious&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out, and they joined battle in the Valley of Siddim with Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar, four kings against five. Now the Valley of Siddim was full of bitumen pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them, and the rest fled to the hill country. So the enemy took all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is often called “Four Kings against Five Kings”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four Mesopotamian kings won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t think tar pits like Californians have in La Brea, a lake of sticky muck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally occurring bitumen in this region is solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pits here are more like wells, or maybe even more like mine shafts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They didn’t fall in and get stuck; the locals needed a place to hide and they knew where to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four kings routed then plundered, including deporting the population, which is a foreshadowing of the Babylonian captivity in 586 BCE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the captives was Lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1412-13-the-babylonians-take-lot-into-captivity&#34;&gt;Genesis 14:12-13: The Babylonians take Lot into captivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also took Lot, the son of Abram&amp;rsquo;s brother, who was dwelling in Sodom, and his possessions, and went their way. Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew, who was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and of Aner. These were allies of Abram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first mention of Hebrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think of the term in terms of ethnicity or religion, but Walton points out, at this time it may have been a “designation of a social class.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, it certainly could have referenced the fact that Abram and his family were not polytheistic like everyone else around them, but were worshippers of the One who will be known as the “God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1414-17-abram-rescues-lot&#34;&gt;Genesis 14:14-17: Abram rescues Lot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, 318 of them, and went in pursuit as far as Dan. And he divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and defeated them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus. Then he brought back all the possessions, and also brought back his kinsman Lot with his possessions, and the women and the people. After his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King&amp;rsquo;s Valley).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to think of “next of kin” as someone younger, but in this context, Abram was Lot’s next of kin. That means Abram, as lot’s redeemer, wasn’t just being nice; Abram had an obligation to go after Lot and rescue him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does Jesus as our Kinsman Redeemer, have an obligation to pursue us who are lost? I think He sees it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw in Revelation how there is a point where God seems to say “if you mess with My people then you’re messing with Me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine being in enemy captivity but not wanting to be rescued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the sad state of the unbeliever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Enemy knows that the best kind of enslaved person is one who doesn’t know he’s enslaved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any aspects of our lives where we are enslaved but don’t view it that way? (hurts, habits, hangups, false dichotomies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to get in the habit of viewing life through a spiritual lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that respect, the abduction of Lot is a satanic attack on the Messianic line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lot is the father of the Ammonites and the Moabites&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naamah, the Ammonite is listed as the mother of Rehoboam (2 Kings 12:12) and, more famously, Ruth, is the mother of Obed (Matthew 1:5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As both Obed and Rehoboam are in the Messianic line, Jesus has Moabite and Ammonite lineage – an attack on Lot puts that in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is everywhere in the Old Testament if you know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a sense of how wealthy Abram had become, we are told he has a security detail of 318 men; potentially the same size as the armies of each of the city-states named (but likely much inferior to the size of the combined armies of the Mesopotamian kings)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like Gideon, Abram used the tactic of dividing his already small forces in a nighttime ambush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan in this case is being used anachronistically (since Dan has not been born yet); this refers to the extreme north of the Promised Land, again up near Mt. Hermon where the demonic activity occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it’s the same location as mentioned in 2 Sam 18:18, the King’s valley is where the Kidron and the Hinnom valleys come together in Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Samuel 18:18 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself the pillar that is in the King&amp;rsquo;s Valley, for he said, “I have no son to keep my name in remembrance.” He called the pillar after his own name, and it is called Absalom&amp;rsquo;s monument to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an “Absalom’s pillar” today that dates to the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century CE, but this is not to say it couldn’t have been built over the original site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James 4:17 So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though Lot had only himself to blame for his situation, Abraham did all he could to save him.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-21&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1418-20-melchizedek-and-abram-have-a-banquet&#34;&gt;Genesis 14:18-20: Melchizedek and Abram have a banquet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. (He was priest of God Most High.) And he blessed him and said, “Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth; and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand!” And Abram gave him a tenth of everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton speculates that Melchizedek might have been the principal king of the region. Salem is usually considered to be Jerusalem, which would make this the first reference to Jerusalem in Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psalms 76:2 His abode has been established in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“God Most High” (El Alyon) is not necessarily Our God, but is probably El, the chief Canaanite god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elements of communion get our attention. In context, the shared meal likely signifies Melchizedek’s desire to make peace with Abram and his formidable army. Abram in turn acknowledges Melchizedek’s status by paying tribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This foreshadows the Messianic banquet when we too will dine at the table with Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 8:11 I tell you, many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know almost nothing about Melchizedek (King of Righteousness); and we probably would not remember his name if it were not for Psalm 110 and Hebrews 5-7, particularly chapter 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psalms 110:4 The LORD has sworn and will not change his mind, “You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews presents a complicated distinction between a priest of Levi and a priest in the order of Melchizedek (who is both a king and a priest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Israelites offer tithes and bow to Levi/the Aaronic priesthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham could not bow down to a Levite because Levi was still in Abraham’s loins (that’s what Hebrews says!), but he could bow down to Melchizedek&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the logic, the priesthood of Melchizedek is superior to the priesthood of Aaron. Messiah belongs to a different priesthood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus does not cancel or abolish the Aaronic priesthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He merely operates in a different realm (for example, not the earthly Temple but the heavenly Temple).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the writer to Hebrews says Melchizedek is a type of Jesus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalms 110:4 says a priest in the order of Melchizedek, not “the priest Melchizedek.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 7:3 He is without father or mother or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God he continues a priest forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melchizedek was not a supernatural apparition, but no such lineage is documented. Therefore he is a type of Jesus who existed at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the Levitical priesthood, Melchizedek represents the Messianic priesthood during the Messianic era of peace (shalom/Salem), ruling from Jerusalem.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham tithes before it was mandated later in Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham tithed because it pleased God, not because it was something he was required to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also expected nothing in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another way of saying, Abraham didn’t tithe to be saved; he tithed because he already was saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-22&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-23&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1421-the-king-of-sodom-vs-king-of-salem&#34;&gt;Genesis 14:21: The King of Sodom vs. King of Salem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The King of Sodom might be thought of as an “anti-Melchizedek.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it is clear that the Divine Narrator wants us to connect Melchizidek with the King of Sodom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Melchizedek is a type of Messiah, then the King of Sodom is a type of the Anti-messiah; otherwise known as Antichrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note we have “Jerusalem” (holy city) versus “Sodom” (wicked city)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He shows up here requesting the souls of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1422-24-abram-declines-spoils-of-war&#34;&gt;Genesis 14:22-24: Abram declines spoils of war&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have lifted my hand to the LORD, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth, that I would not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that is yours, lest you should say, ‘I have made Abram rich.’ I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me. Let Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre take their share.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is often the case, when we have a spiritual success, we are often tempted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham, who willingly gave a 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; to Melchizedek, the King of Jerusalem, refuses to give anything to the King of Sodom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram is a representative of the LORD, God Most High, and will not profit from his military action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was likely a written agreement between Abram and the King of Sodom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Genesis chapter 14 may be the text of that agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hebrews-7&#34;&gt;Hebrews 7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, and to him Abraham apportioned a tenth part of everything. He is first, by translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of Salem, that is, king of peace. He is without father or mother or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God he continues a priest forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See how great this man was to whom Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth of the spoils! And those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take tithes from the people, that is, from their brothers, though these also are descended from Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this man who does not have his descent from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior. In one case tithes are received by mortal men, but in the other case, by one of whom it is testified that he lives. One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham, for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him. Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, rather than one named after the order of Aaron?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well. For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar. For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This becomes even more evident when another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek, who has become a priest, not on the basis of a legal requirement concerning bodily descent, but by the power of an indestructible life. For it is witnessed of him, “You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.” For on the one hand, a former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness (for the law made nothing perfect); but on the other hand, a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God. And it was not without an oath. For those who formerly became priests were made such without an oath, but this one was made a priest with an oath by the one who said to him: “The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, ‘You are a priest forever.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes Jesus the guarantor of a better covenant. The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office, but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them. For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. He has no need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily, first for his own sins and then for those of the people, since he did this once for all when he offered up himself. For the law appoints men in their weakness as high priests, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;After these things, I looked; and there before me was a door standing open in heaven; and the voice like a trumpet which I had heard speaking with me before said, &amp;ldquo;Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after these things.&amp;rdquo; (2) Instantly I was in the Spirit, and there before me in heaven stood a throne, and on the throne Someone was sitting. (3) The One sitting there gleamed like diamonds and rubies, and a rainbow shining like emerald encircled the throne. (4) Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on the thrones sat twenty-four elders dressed in white clothing and wearing gold crowns on their heads. (5) From the throne came forth lightnings, voices and thunderings; and before the throne were seven flaming torches, which are the sevenfold Spirit of God. (6) In front of the throne was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. In the center, around the throne, were four living beings covered with eyes in front and behind. (7) The first living being was like a lion, the second living being was like an ox, the third living being had a face that looked human, and the fourth living being was like a flying eagle. (8) Each of the four living beings had six wings and was covered with eyes inside and out; and day and night they never stop saying, &amp;ldquo;Holy, holy, holy is Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies the One who was, who is and who is coming!&amp;rdquo; (9) And whenever the living beings give glory, honor and thanks to the One sitting on the throne, to the One who lives forever and ever, (10) the twenty-four elders fall down before the One sitting on the throne, who lives forever and ever, and worship him. They throw their crowns in front of the throne and say, (11) &amp;ldquo;You are worthy, Adonai Eloheinu, to have glory, honor and power, because you created all things—yes, because of your will they were created and came into being!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;revelation-backgrounds-focus&#34;&gt;Revelation Backgrounds&amp;rsquo; Focus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are entering the apocalyptic phase, so there won&amp;rsquo;t be much geography and probably not many pictures. We&amp;rsquo;re basically going to track down and read some passages that the original audience likely would have known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we said at the outset of our study in Revelation, part of the challenge with apocalyptic literature is that the person recording the events is trying to describe the indescribable. Therefore, they are forced to use symbolic language that at times seems other-worldly (because it IS other-worldly; it&amp;rsquo;s not of this world!). This makes any concrete interpretation difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As there are numerous competent commentaries offering various conjectures on what Revelation chapters four and following could mean for 20th and 21st-century believers, we will &lt;em&gt;attempt&lt;/em&gt; to limit our study here to identifying and studying the allusions and common themes that appear elsewhere in the Bible. Where possible, we will limit conjectures to those that could have been understood by the original 1st-century audience. In any case, we will attempt to put aside any preconceptions and let the Text speak for itself, even though this may mean quoting an equally cryptic passage from the Old Testament. In the interest of time we won&amp;rsquo;t be able to unpack everything. Just soak it in and remember Isaiah 55:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 55:8-11 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the LORD. (9) For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts. (10) “For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return there but water the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater, (11)  &lt;strong&gt;so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose&lt;/strong&gt;, and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 11 means that any time we can spend studying God&amp;rsquo;s word is productive and profitable time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After these things&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;I looked&lt;/strong&gt;; and there before me was a door standing open in heaven; and the voice like a trumpet which I had heard speaking with me before said, &amp;ldquo;Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after these things.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;meta-tauta-after-these-things&#34;&gt;Meta Tauta &amp;ldquo;after these things&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This serves as a transition from the previous vision of the seven assemblies to this vision in the heavenly throne room.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A roughly equivalent phrase in the Hebrew Bible is &amp;ldquo;I looked, and behold.&amp;rdquo;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Eze 10:1 Then I &lt;strong&gt;looked, and behold&lt;/strong&gt;, on the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubim there appeared above them something like a sapphire, in appearance like a throne.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Dan 10:5 &lt;strong&gt;I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold,&lt;/strong&gt; a man clothed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On that note, Heiser sees Rev 4-6 as a &amp;ldquo;divine council&amp;rdquo; scene, just like Isaiah 6, Ezekiel 1 and Daniel 7&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep in mind that &amp;ldquo;Meta Tauta&amp;rdquo; might NOT mean the next thing that happens chronologically.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It could simply be the next part of the revelation: after that vision, comes the next vision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since other parts of the bible are not in chronological order, we should not necessarily assume Revelation is in chronological order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;heaven-opened&#34;&gt;Heaven opened&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus promised this in John 1:51
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;John 1:51 And he said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, &lt;strong&gt;you will see heaven opened&lt;/strong&gt;, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the heavenly temple referenced in Hebrews.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Heb 9:24 For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are several other examples of a mortal being given a glimpse of the heavenly realm:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jacob
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Genesis 28:12-16 And he dreamed, and behold, there was a &lt;strong&gt;ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it&lt;/strong&gt;! (13) And behold, the LORD stood above it and said, “I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring. (14) Your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you and your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed. (15) Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land. For I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” (16) Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moses
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Exodus 19:19-20 And as the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in thunder. (20) The LORD came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. &lt;strong&gt;And the LORD called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Isaiah 6:1 In the year that King Uzziah died &lt;strong&gt;I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne&lt;/strong&gt;, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ezekiel
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ezekiel 1:1 In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the exiles by the Chebar canal, the heavens were opened, &lt;strong&gt;and I saw visions of God&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Daniel 7:1-2 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head as he lay in his bed. Then he wrote down the dream and told the sum of the matter. (2) Daniel declared, “&lt;strong&gt;I saw in my vision by night&lt;/strong&gt;, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Daniel 10:5  &lt;strong&gt;I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold&lt;/strong&gt;, a man clothed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster sees the High Holy Days liturgy.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The doors to the Temple would open at Rosh Hashana to the sound of the shofar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They would stay open through the 10 days of awe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They would close at the sound of another trumpet after Yom Kippur.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;come-up-here-and-i-will-show-you&#34;&gt;Come up here and I will show you&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Come up here&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; recalls God&amp;rsquo;s call to Moses
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Exo 19:24 And the LORD said to him, “Go down, and come up bringing Aaron with you. But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, lest he break out against them.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;I will show you&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; recalls Jacob&amp;rsquo;s prophecies in Genesis 49.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Genesis 49:1 Then Jacob called his sons and said, “Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what shall happen to you in days to come.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-42-in-spirit&#34;&gt;Rev 4:2-In spirit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Instantly I was in (the) spirit, and there before me in heaven stood a throne, and on the throne, Someone was sitting.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;in-the-sspirit&#34;&gt;In (the) S/spirit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As with Rev 1:10, the Greek does not have a definite article.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John was literally &amp;ldquo;in spirit.&amp;rdquo; We can interpret this as a hyper spiritual trancelike state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This may mean only that John was not in the body (or like Paul, &amp;ldquo;whether in the body, or out of the body I do not know – God knows.&amp;rdquo; (2 Cor 12:2))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ezekiel literally says &amp;ldquo;it lifted me up spirit&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Eze 11:1 Then &lt;strong&gt;the S/spirit lifted me up&lt;/strong&gt; and brought me to the East Gate of the LORD&amp;rsquo;s house, &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Eze 11:24 Then &lt;strong&gt;the S/spirit took me up&lt;/strong&gt; and brought me in a vision by the &lt;strong&gt;Spirit of God&lt;/strong&gt; into Chaldea, to those in captivity. And the vision that I had seen went up from me. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again, there is no definite article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, the Hebrew is vague about whether this is the spirit of God or just in spirit as the opposite of in the body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translations that capitalize the &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; in spirit are assuming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John, like Isaiah and Ezekiel, was somehow transported in a vision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sitting&#34;&gt;Sitting&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again, the One sitting is not named.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re reminded that John knew Jesus as well as anyone did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If John does not assume this is Jesus, maybe we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Holy One sitting is an allusion to Isaiah 6
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Isaiah 6:1 In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord &lt;strong&gt;sitting upon a throne&lt;/strong&gt;, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-43--sardius-jasper-emerald&#34;&gt;Rev 4:3- Sardius, Jasper, Emerald&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The One sitting there gleamed like diamonds (jasper) and rubies (carnelian/sardius), and a rainbow shining like an emerald encircled the throne.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keener noted that John&amp;rsquo;s simple description of the throne room deliberately contrasted with the Roman emperor&amp;rsquo;s pompous display of power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The original audience would have recognized the carnelian (aka sardius), jasper, and emerald stones as being from the breastplate of the High Priest.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Exodus 28:15-20 “You shall make a breastpiece of judgment, in skilled work. In the style of the ephod you shall make it—of gold, blue and purple and scarlet yarns, and fine twined linen shall you make it. (16) It shall be square and doubled, a span its length and a span its breadth. (17) You shall set in it four rows of stones. A row of &lt;strong&gt;sardius&lt;/strong&gt;, topaz, and carbuncle shall be the first row; (18) and the second row an &lt;strong&gt;emerald&lt;/strong&gt;, a sapphire, and a diamond; (19) and the third row a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; (20) and the fourth row a beryl, an onyx, and a &lt;strong&gt;jasper&lt;/strong&gt;. They shall be set in gold filigree.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were 12 stones arranged in the birth order of the 12 tribes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sardius&lt;/strong&gt; = Reuben (1st Born) and &lt;strong&gt;jasper&lt;/strong&gt; = Benjamin (last born)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is another way of saying &amp;ldquo;from A to Z&amp;rdquo; in other words all the 12 tribes were represented by the One who was sitting on the Throne, not just Reuben and Benjamin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we know this, the fact that the emerald appears preeminent should not surprise us.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emerald&lt;/strong&gt; was the fourth stone = Judah (4th born)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judah held the status of &amp;ldquo;Firstborn&amp;rdquo; because Reuben, Simeon, and Levi all forfeited the right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note Stern&amp;rsquo;s CJB translation of the first two stones as generic &amp;ldquo;diamonds and rubies&amp;rdquo; is odd; the Greek specifically identifies these stones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ezekiel saw similar precious gems in the throneroom of God
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ezekiel 1:26-28 And above the expanse over their heads there was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like sapphire; and seated above the likeness of a throne was a likeness with a human appearance. (27) And upward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were gleaming metal, like the appearance of fire enclosed all around. And downward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness around him. (28) Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around. Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard the voice of one speaking.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note Ezekiel didn&amp;rsquo;t see God directly. He saw an &amp;ldquo;appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD&amp;rdquo;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-44-24-elders&#34;&gt;Rev 4:4-24 Elders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on the thrones sat twenty-four elders dressed in white clothing and wearing gold crowns on their heads.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thrones, white clothing, and crowns are distinguishing characteristics of promises to the overcomers in Rev 2 &amp;amp; 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are many conjectures as to who these 24 elders are.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most importantly John does not tell us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The earthly office of Elder (&lt;em&gt;presbuteros&lt;/em&gt;) is the highest official in an assembly (Titus 1:5; Acts 15:6, 1 Pet 2:5,9). Therefore many see the elders as representative of the &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; at large.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As Revelation 4 is about Temple service, one possible explanation is to remember that David organized the Levitical priesthood into 24 courses or divisions.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These divisions represented all of Israel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;1 Chronicles 24:3b, 18 David organized them according to the appointed duties in their service…the &lt;strong&gt;twenty-fourth&lt;/strong&gt; to Maaziah&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we remember, Zechariah, John the Baptist&amp;rsquo;s father, was from the course of Abijah (Luke 1:5, 8), in other words, the eighth course (1 Chr 24:10).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each course would serve two weeks out of the year (some sources imply one week, twice a year) and then would go back to work their trade and be with their families the rest of the year, just as Zechariah did (Luke 1:23).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This speculation would seem to fit with the model of the Camp of Israel from Numbers 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Levites formed the inner box and the 12 tribes formed the outer.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss support for the 12 tribes forming the outer box at verse 7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many scholars do not see the Levitical priesthood continuing in Heaven. While I find this somewhat unlikely, non-Levitical priesthoods are attested to in Scripture
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jethro: &lt;small&gt;Exo 3:1 Now Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law, Jethro, the priest of Midian, and he led his flock to the west side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melchizedek: &lt;small&gt;Gen 14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. (He was priest of God Most High.) &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Us: &lt;small&gt; 1 Pet_2:9 But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.&lt;/small&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many commentators infer that of the 24, 12 are the representatives of the 12 tribes, and the other 12 are the 12 apostles.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is nothing but conjecture to support this view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One possible counterargument is that Jesus said the Apostles would rule OVER the 12 tribes, not alongside them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heiser suggests these are deified believers.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot; Heaven and earth, divinity and humanity, are not easily separable when it comes to the divine council and God’s plan for restoration of Eden.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In terms of heavenly elders, the only other reference appears in Isaiah.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Isaiah 24:23 Then the moon will be confounded and the sun ashamed, for the LORD of hosts reigns on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and his glory will be before his elders. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 24 elders of Revelation will appear in 4:10, 5:8, 11:16, and 19:4, each time worshipping God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;crowns&#34;&gt;Crowns&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the extent that these elders could be representatives of Jewish or non-Jewish believers, note that any believer may obtain different crowns for different acts of service and devotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crown of life for those who love Him and suffer for His sake (Jas 1:12, Rev 2:10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crown of righteousness for those who loved his appearing (2 Tim 4:8)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crown of glory for those who feed the flock (1 Pet 5:4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crown incorruptible for those who persevere (1 Cor 9:25)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crown of rejoicing for those who win souls (1 Thes 2:19)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the &amp;ldquo;Bema seat&amp;rdquo; rewards for those whose works survived the judgment (gold, silver, precious stones, vs wood, hay, stubble 1 Cor 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-45-thunder&#34;&gt;Rev 4:5-Thunder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;From the throne came forth lightnings, voices, and thunderings; and before the throne were seven flaming torches, which are the sevenfold Spirit of God&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;special effects&amp;rdquo; if we can call them that, seem to be recalling the giving of the Torah at Mt. Sinai (or perhaps it’s the other way around! Perhaps the display at Mount Sinai was a type and shadow of the Heavenly throne room).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Exo 19:16 Then it came to pass on the third day, in the morning, that there were &lt;strong&gt;thunderings&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;lightnings&lt;/strong&gt;, and a thick cloud on the mountain; and the sound of the trumpet was &lt;strong&gt;very loud,&lt;/strong&gt; so that all the people who were in the camp trembled.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ezekiel saw and heard similarly.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ezekiel 1:4 As I looked, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, and a great cloud, with brightness around it, and &lt;strong&gt;fire&lt;/strong&gt; flashing forth continually, and in the midst of the &lt;strong&gt;fire&lt;/strong&gt;, as it were gleaming metal. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ezekiel 3:12 Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the &lt;strong&gt;voice&lt;/strong&gt; of a great earthquake: “Blessed be the glory of the LORD from its place!” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;shavuotpentecost&#34;&gt;Shavuot/Pentecost&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Christians don&amp;rsquo;t realize that Acts 2 is a virtual carbon copy of the Giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. The Jewish feast of Shavuot is the day, according to tradition, that the Torah was given to Moses. The same day on the Jewish calendar, the day we call Pentecost, is the day the Spirit was poured out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Act 2:1-3 When the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. (2) And suddenly there came a &lt;strong&gt;sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house&lt;/strong&gt; where they were sitting. (3) Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of &lt;strong&gt;fire&lt;/strong&gt;, and one sat upon each of them. (4) And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-46sea-of-crystal&#34;&gt;Rev 4:6–Sea of Crystal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;In front of the throne was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. In the center, around the throne, were four living beings covered with eyes in front and behind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the heavenly temple, there is a counterpart to the molten sea.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;1 Kings 7:23-25 Then he made the &lt;strong&gt;sea of cast metal&lt;/strong&gt;. It was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference. (24) Under its brim were gourds, for ten cubits, compassing the sea all around. The gourds were in two rows, cast with it when it was cast. (25) It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The sea was set on them, and all their rear parts were inward.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was for ceremonial purification so that those in service could be ritually pure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One suggestion is the sea is now crystal because no further purification is needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In terms of the heavenly temple, John will also see an altar of incense (5:8) an altar of sacrifice (6:9), and the ark itself (11:19) all components of the earthly temple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Sea of glass or crystal that John say represents the firmament Ezekiel saw.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Eze 1:22 The likeness of the &lt;strong&gt;firmament&lt;/strong&gt; above the heads of the living creatures was like the color of an awesome &lt;strong&gt;crystal&lt;/strong&gt;, stretched out over their heads. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We first encounter the &amp;ldquo;firmament&amp;rdquo; in Genesis 1.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Gen 1:6-8 Then God said, &amp;ldquo;Let there be a &lt;strong&gt;firmament&lt;/strong&gt; in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.&amp;rdquo; (7) Thus God made the &lt;strong&gt;firmament&lt;/strong&gt;, and divided the waters which were under the &lt;strong&gt;firmament&lt;/strong&gt; from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so. (8) And God called the &lt;strong&gt;firmament&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Heaven&lt;/strong&gt;. So the evening and the morning were the second day.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;four-living-creatures&#34;&gt;Four Living Creatures&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some translations have &amp;ldquo;four beasts&amp;rdquo; – this is unfortunate. The Greek word is &lt;em&gt;Zoa&lt;/em&gt;, which is simply a living being as opposed to a sinister, voracious creature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eyes
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Eze_10:12 And their whole body, their rims, and their spokes, their wings, and the wheels were full of eyes all around—the wheels that the four of them had.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eyes all around denote perfect vision, i.e., omniscience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where is God? He&amp;rsquo;s on His heavenly throne watching us and testing us!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Psa 11:4 The LORD is in His holy temple, The LORD&amp;rsquo;s throne is in heaven; &lt;strong&gt;His eyes behold, His eyelids test the sons of men. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-47-lion-ox-man-eagle&#34;&gt;Rev 4:7-Lion, Ox, Man, Eagle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The first living being was like a lion, the second living being was like an ox, the third living being had a face that looked human, and the fourth living being was like a flying eagle&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The four living creatures have a direct parallel to Ezekiel
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ezekiel 1:5-11 (5) And from the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had a human likeness, (6) but each had four faces, and each of them had four wings. (7) Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf&amp;rsquo;s foot. And they sparkled like burnished bronze. (8) Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. And the four had their faces and their wings thus: (9) their wings touched one another. Each one of them went straight forward, without turning as they went. (10) As for the likeness of their faces, each had a &lt;strong&gt;human&lt;/strong&gt; face. The four had the face of a &lt;strong&gt;lion&lt;/strong&gt; on the right side, the four had the face of an &lt;strong&gt;ox&lt;/strong&gt; on the left side, and the four had the face of an &lt;strong&gt;eagle&lt;/strong&gt;. (11) Such were their faces. And their wings were spread out above. Each creature had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while two covered their bodies.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing our Numbers 2 discussion, each of the 12 tribes (minus Levi but with Joseph split into Ephraim and Manasseh), was organized into four camps, with one tribe named as the standard-bearer for the camp.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun were under the standard of Judah;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reuben, Simeon, and Gad were in the camp of Reuben and so forth with Ephraim and Dan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can see this in the image above.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an aside, it&amp;rsquo;s fascinating that when we align the tribes roughly proportionally with their population we get the shape of a cross.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Jewish tradition (inferred from passages like Genesis 49) , each standard had an image. Later sages have observed the characteristic of each image. This is in parenthesis below.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judah = Lion (the most exalted non-domesticated creation)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ephraim = Ox (the most exalted domesticated creation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reuben = Man (the most exalted creation; given dominion over all)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dan = Eagle (the most exalted bird)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So, just as we had the 24 divisions of the Levites around the inner circle, we have the standards of each of the four camps surrounding the throne in the heavenly tabernacle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the Christian Era, these same images became attached to each of the four gospels, though interestingly the application of the creatures to the gospels has not been consistent over the last 2000 years. Here is the current application
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matthew – Jesus is the Son of David, the Lion of the tribe of Judah – genealogy goes back to Abraham the first Hebrew/Jew – Lion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark = Jesus came to serve – Mark has no genealogy because we aren&amp;rsquo;t interested in the pedigree of a servant – Ox, the ultimate service animal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luke = Jesus is the Son of Man – genealogy back to Adam, the first man – Man&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John – the Son of God – genealogy of the pre-existent One (In the beginning was the Word) - Eagle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-48-holy-holy-holy&#34;&gt;Rev 4:8-Holy, Holy, Holy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Each of the four living beings had six wings and was covered with eyes inside and out; and day and night they never stop saying, &amp;ldquo;Holy, holy, holy is Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies the One who was, who is and who is coming!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Isaiah 6:2-3 Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. 3 And one called to another and said: “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-49-he-reigns&#34;&gt;Rev 4:9-He Reigns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;And whenever the living beings give glory, honor, and thanks to the One sitting on the throne, to the One who lives forever and ever,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Exodus 15: 18 The LORD will reign forever and ever. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-410-11-he-is-worthy&#34;&gt;Rev 4:10-11-He is Worthy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;the twenty-four elders fall down before the One sitting on the throne, who lives forever and ever, and worship him. They throw their crowns in front of the throne and say,&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;You are worthy, Adonai Eloheinu, to have glory, honor and power, because you created all things—yes, because of your will they were created and came into being!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;1 Chr 29: 11 Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all. 12 Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all. In your hand are power and might, and in your hand it is to make great and to give strength to all. 13 And now we thank you, our God, and praise your glorious name. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this was a tour-de-force of Bible References. Remember one of the blessings of Studying Revelation is exposure to virtually every other book in the Bible. There is blessing in studying and obeying His word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael S. Heiser, &lt;em&gt;The Unseen Realm: Recovering the Supernatural Worldview of the Bible&lt;/em&gt;, First edition (Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press, 2015), 354.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heiser, 355.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also predicated on the assumption that, for example, when Judah is told to camp to the east, they were prohibited from being northeast or southeast. They could only be due east. Ephraim could only be due west, not northwest or southwest, and so forth. This is probably a fair assumption, otherwise both Judah and Reuben could technically have occupied the area to the southeast, at which point common sense would tell us that at least one of the tribes would have been in the wrong position.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the POOLS OF BETHESDA, we follow Yeshua as He makes another pilgrimage to Jerusalem to keep one of the festivals. On the Sabbath day, we head for the Temple. On the way there, we walk along the city walls and cut through the five-colonnaded double pool of Bethesda on our way to the Sheep Gate. Then we duck inside and up to the Temple to spend the rest of the day, where a delegation from the religious leaders in Judea reprimands Him for healing on the Sabbath. The ensuing discourse occurs within the Temple courts, but the discussion takes us from the carpenter shop in Nazareth to the end of the era, the resurrection of the dead, the Messianic Kingdom, and the final judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;contents&#34;&gt;Contents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was the unnamed feast of the Ioudaioi?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened to verse 3b and 4?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where and, more importantly, WHAT were these pools?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why were the Ioudaioi upset?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who were the THREE witnesses testifying on behalf of Jesus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:5.03611in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schlaegel’s introduction: “Jesus interrupted His ministry in Galilee (Map 11-5) when He came to Jerusalem for an unnamed festival. On a Sabbath at the Pools of Bethesda, Jesus healed a man who had been lame for 38 years. After nearly two thousand years of searching for these pools, they were finally excavated beginning in the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are located just north of the temple mount, near the remains of the Antonio fortress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now know that these pools were not associated with the Jewish temple whatsoever but with the Greco-Roman God of healing, Asclepius. So, we have a man, whom we later find out is Jewish, had ineffectually waited for years on a superstitious healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this discovery, we can confidently say that the description in some Greek manuscripts in John 5:3b-4 of an angel of the Lord stirring the waters is an &lt;strong&gt;incorrect&lt;/strong&gt; 4th century AD addition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Box E marks the pools of Bethesda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important geographic clue could like in the fact that although the pools today are inside the city walls, at the time of Jesus, they were outside the city walls. On this map, we can see that Gogaltha was also outside the walls. Despite the pool’s proximity to the Temple, we believe from archeology that these pools were actually pagan. The Greeks and Romans had pagan healing centers called Asclepions throughout the empire. The larges one was in the city of Pergamom, one of the seven churches of Revelation. You might want to check out the background video on Pergamom: &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/NcftNgsIHWw?t=569&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/NcftNgsIHWw?t=569&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.png&#34; style=&#34;width:4.42479in;height:5.23269in&#34; /&gt;Asclepius with Serpent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that these pools are pagan and not Jewish changes the entire complexity of the passage, which we will get into as the study unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the miracle, Jesus claimed to not only have the power to heal but to raise the dead.” In other words, Jesus is “greater than the healing sanctuaries of His day.” He is also greater than our medical system today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;transition&#34;&gt;Transition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like our previous lesson at the Nazareth synagogue represented a transition from private to public in Jesus’ Galilean ministry, this lesson represents a transition from private to public in His Judean ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, John, in reading the available manuscripts from the synoptic writers noticed a lack of detail on Jesus’ activities in Jerusalem prior to Passion week. In any case, John pays significantly more attention to Jesus’ activities in Judea than do Matthew, Mark, and Luke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we move into more public encounters, we should begin to be like stage directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the setting; where is He? Remote countryside? Galilean village? The big city of Jerusalem or its “suburbs”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are people seeking out Jesus or is He targeting someone for a specific interaction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is present, and who is not present? To be specific we need to say who is “documented as being present.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note whom Jesus interacts directly versus onlookers;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note who might be favorably disposed to Jesus’ message, who might be hostile and who might be on the fence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, note who is not mentioned. The disciples. Jesus went to the feast alone, or at least John did not mention the presence of any other friendlies accompanying Jesus to the feast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-51--an-unnamed-feast&#34;&gt;John 5:1 – An unnamed Feast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these things, there was a feast of the Ioudaioi, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John likes this phrase &lt;em&gt;meta touta&lt;/em&gt;, after these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s peculiar that this is an unnamed feast of the Ioudaioi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps omitting the name of the feast is another clue that the location of the miracle is in no way connected with Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we get to John 9 and that healing, the Pool of Siloam WAS connected with the Temple and WAS inside the city walls at the time. It is outside the walls today. The entire complexion of John 9 is vastly different from John 5. It’s a great study to compare the two, which we will do when we get to John 9 in several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is this feast?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were three compulsory feasts, Passover, Shavuot (Pentecost), and Sukkot (Tabernacles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also several minor feasts that were not compulsory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus will attend one of these in John 10, Hanukkah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our working hypothesis is that when John says the feast is “of the Ioudaioi,” we’ll presume it is one of the three major fests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minor feasts were ALWAYS Ioudaioi feasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our proof for this is in John 10; only the Ioudaioi had a feast of dedication, so there is no need to say “feast of the dedication of the Ioudaioi.” And indeed, John does not say this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ioudaioi, as well as the Samaritans and Essenes, had feasts of Passover, Shavuot, and Tabernacles, making the “of the ioudaioi” clarification necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passover doesn’t fit the chronology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the Shavuot or the Tabernacles festival in the same year following the Passover in John 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The feast” usually refers to Sukkot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can almost ask why John bothered to mention the fact that there was a feast since it has no bearing on the events of the chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, one speculation is John is writing to an Israelite, but non Jewish, audience. Therefore “feast of the Ioudaioi” is said to distinguish the festival from nearly identical ones observed by Essenes and Samaritans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll see in John 10, that John merely says, “feast of dedication and it was winter.” This is unmistakably Hanukkah. There is no need to say “Hanukkah of the Ioudaioi” because only the Jews observed Hanukkah. The Essenes and Samaritans did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to Jerusalem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to avoid Samaria, many Jews traveled to Jerusalem via the Jordan Rift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Jericho they traveled up the Ascent of Adummim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we tend to say “up” when we go north and “down” when we go “south”, because of Jerusalem’s elevation and, more importantly, status, we ALWAYS go “UP” to Jerusalem (even if conceivably traveling from a higher elevation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John is much more interested in Jesus’ Judean encounters than His Galilean ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-52-3a&#34;&gt;John 5:2-3a&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in Jerusalem, by the Sheep Gate, there is a pool which in Hebrew is called Bethesda, having five porticoes. In these porticoes lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, limping, or paralyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.875in&#34; alt=&#34;C:\PLBL\03 Jerusalem\Model of Jerusalem\Jerusalem model Pools of Bethesda, tb010200217.jpg&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another description where skeptics were having a field day in denying scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They would say that John possibly wrote his Gospel 25 years after Jerusalem was destroyed; perhaps his aging memory had failed him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can a pool have five porticos?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that Roman pools are four-sided and there can only be at most, four porticos around the pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one had ever heard of a pentagon-shaped poo,l but this is what archeologists were looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one day in the mid-1960s, archaeologists excavated what turned out to be two pools separated by a portico in the middle, with four porticos all around. (photo credit&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). John’s memory wasn’t so bad after all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today this is in the northeastern part of Jerusalem by a well-preserved crusader church called St. Anne’s, named for the mother of Mary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excavation of the pools is continuing to this day – it’s amazing to see the difference in 2023 versus when I was there previously in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is extremely difficult to visualize as the pools were evidently extremely deep. Today the bottom is a good 40’ below the surface level. Over the centuries, Byzantines, Muslims, and Crusaders built structures on top of the pools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-55&#34;&gt;John 5:5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NKJV and KJV includes verses 3b-4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John 5:3-4 (NKJV) &lt;em&gt;In these lay a great multitude of sick people, blind, lame, paralyzed,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and stirred up the water; then whoever stepped in first, after the stirring of the water, was made well of whatever disease he had.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now know this is an error, probably inserted by a well-meaning scribe. It is not included in the most reliable manuscripts. Perhaps the scribe was trying to explain the “stirring of the waters” in verse 7 and was somehow unfamiliar with Asclepius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, including verse 4 leaves us with precisely the wrong impression of what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were not Jewish pools associated with the nearby Temple, and it was not an Angel of the LORD who stirred up the waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 90s, archaeologists found further evidence that the pools were part of an Aesculapian, a pagan healing center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site was a center of a Roman healing cult of the god Asclepius. Many archeologists believe the Asclepius dates to several centuries after Jesus, but it appears to be built upon an earlier Asklepion. More than 400 such healing facilities have been found throughout the Roman empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serpent imagery, hallucinogens, and trickery by the priests were all employed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the priests likely opened a valve between the two pools, which caused a “stirring of the water” attributed to the gods. Lo! It’s a Miracle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asclepios’ mythical daughters are Hygeia and Panacea, which is where we get our healing related words “hygiene” and “panacea”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The symbol of Asclepius is a snake around a pole, likely a corrupted version of Moses lifting up the bronze serpent in the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you’ve ever wondered where modern medicine gets its snake imagery, now you know! &lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.gif&#34; style=&#34;width:2.38986in;height:2.37326in&#34; alt=&#34;Edward Elric&amp;#39;s Flamel | REB Research Blog&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the Devil brings forward Asclepius as the raiser of the dead and the healer of all diseases, may I not say that in this matter likewise he has imitated the prophecies about Christ?” – Justin Martyr. “Dialogue with Trypho”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why bring all this up about Asclepios?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The complexion of the story changes once we realize the man is also paralyzed spiritually - seeking healing from a false god&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These “waters” can’t heal him - only the Pure and Living Water of Jesus, the Mayim Chayim, can (cf. John 2, 3, 4)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to ask, “what was a Jew doing here?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to ask ourselves what we are doing when we look to the world for healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not all western medicine is bad but notice the snake imagery that persists to this day. More and more, medications are changing who we are to the point of altering our DNA/RNA, which should concern us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anytime John mentions a number, we can assume it is significant even though we may not know exactly why it was significant to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here our guess is that John is drawing a connection with this many, who is obviously a Jew but looking for healing in the wrong place, with the Israelite’s 38 years wandering in the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They wandered for a total of 40 years but the punishment for disbelief was 38 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timeframe also underscores the man’s ability to find healing anywhere besides Jesus. This includes the pools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-56-9&#34;&gt;John 5:6-9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, upon seeing this man lying there and knowing that he had already been in that condition for a long time, said to him, “Do you want to get well?” The sick man answered Him, “Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I am coming, another steps down before me.” Jesus *said to him, “Get up, pick up your pallet and walk.” Immediately the man became well, and picked up his pallet and began to walk. Now it was a Sabbath on that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John’s motif of one person not answering another’s question continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John or Jesus has referenced living water in every chapter of John thus far, but Jesus does not mention it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the waters of the pool have nothing to do with the man’s healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He speaks and it is so – just like the first words of God in Genesis 1, “Let there be light.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we will want to contrast this healing with John 9 where Jesus tells the man to wash in the Pool of Siloam. He does NOT command the man to wash here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also want to note this man’s reaction compared with the man in John 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think that Jesus was always causing Sabbath controversy, but there are “only” five recorded healings on Shabbat: Here, John 9, Matthew 12, Luke 13, and Luke 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means there were around 200 Shabbat days in Jesus’ ministry when nothing unusual happened so nothing noteworthy was recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-510-13&#34;&gt;John 5:10-13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the Ioudaioi were saying to the man who was cured, “It is a Sabbath, and it is not permissible for you to carry your pallet.” But he answered them, “He who made me well was the one who said to me, ‘Pick up your pallet and walk.’” They asked him, “Who is the Man who said to you, ‘Pick it up and walk’?” But the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away while there was a crowd in that place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man was healed, but the Ioudaioi are spiritually blind and paralyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This doesn’t necessarily need to be a large group of Ioudaioi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a robust internal debate about what was and was not allowed on Shabbat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Torah itself provides relatively few examples of what constituted “work on the Sabbath.” A famous example is that of the prohibition of gathering wood for a fire (Numbers 15:32).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition, as it tends to do, tries to fill in the gaps with what they think God meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was this tradition that may have included a prohibition on carrying a mat in a public place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is no different than our day with our debates over worship styles, baptism requirements, and communion practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster speculates that these particular Ioudaioi may have been seeking to impose a standard that was not widely accepted, including by Jesus.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be similar to someone whose personal preference is to dress more formally for church but then scolding someone else who doesn’t hold the same dress code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, what could be carried on Shabbat and how far was up for debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t necessarily need to view these rule enforcers as sinister, just like the men of the Nazareth synagogue could have been deeply conflicted and saddened by the fact that they had to uphold the Law of Moses (as they interpreted it) against one of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible will usually tell us when someone approaches Jesus with ill motives; when it doesn’t, we shouldn’t assume bad intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, Jesus in no way was overturning or disrespecting the Sabbath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honoring the Sabbath was one of the big 10 commandments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He could not have violated such a commandment and still claimed to be the Jewish Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ statement in Matthew 24:15-16 acknowledges that He viewed limitations on Shabbat travel as proper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, this is a feast time, so there could have been a million people crowing Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The private nature of this healing leads us to believe this was still early in His ministry (possibly immediately before His proclamation at the Nazareth synagogue, which John doesn’t record).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so, relatively few would have known what He looked like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-514-16&#34;&gt;John 5:14-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, “Behold, you have become well; do not sin anymore, so that nothing worse happens to you.” The man went away, and informed the Ioudaioi that it was Jesus who had made him well. For this reason the Ioudaioi were persecuting Jesus, because He was doing &lt;strong&gt;these things&lt;/strong&gt; on a Sabbath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is big on course corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very fact that you and I are studying together means we’ve allowed Jesus to correct our courses, perhaps multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the themes from our Israel trip was “don’t forget God.” From time to time, Jesus reminds us of when we’ve forgotten God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidently, Jesus didn’t have to tell this man to go to the Temple. He knew what to do; he’d just forgotten God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t exactly sure which specific sin Jesus has in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be the fact that here he was, a Jew seeking healing from a pagan center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, he was guilty of breaking the commandment to have no other gods before the God of Israel. I think we break this commandment today more often than we care to admit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There could have been another specific sin Jesus was referring to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John 9, Jesus makes it clear that there doesn’t have to be a specific sin at the root cause of one’s infirmity, but this doesn’t mean that a specific sin is NEVER the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In view of Jesus’ subsequent discourse, the “sin” could be the resurrection to judgment for bad deeds, referenced in John 5:29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASB says the man “informed” the Ioudaioi about Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems like the translators want us to believe he “informed on” Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the man was not happy with the rebuke even though he was just healed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure the text requires that we read it this way. He could have simply said to the Ioudaioi, “hey I now know who healed me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either approach can map just fine to the text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he’s holding a grudge, this presents a stark contrast with the man in John 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he’s happy he’s healed and restored in his Judaism, he can be viewed as respecting authority along the lines of what Paul describes in Romans 13:1 “Every person is subject to the governing authorities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This outsider, Jesus, was a threat to the Deep State establishment of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lizorkin suggests it’s not “doing these things ON THE SABBATH,” but “DOING THESE THINGS on the Sabbath.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the things Jesus was doing, not when He was doing them that had them riled up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By stepping into the dwelling of a satanic god and establishing the authority of the God of Israel, “the Jerusalem Temple leaders knew that Jesus could not continue performing such powerful miracles without them losing their authority.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-authority-of-the-son-is-the-same-as-the-fathers&#34;&gt;The Authority of the Son is the Same as the Father’s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The healing at the Pools of Bethesda segues into a lengthy discourse about Jesus’ authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John’s overarching objective is to tell us who Jesus IS – specifically, His deity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew-what He said; Mark-what He did; Luke-what He felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than a parenthetical comment by John in verse 18, Jesus speaks uninterrupted between verses 17 and 47.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, a narrative theme of John is to establish Jesus’ authority, specifically in contrast to the illegitimate authority of the Ioudaioi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also see the courtroom motif reappearing. Watch for the terms, “witness,” “testify,” and “believe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-517-18&#34;&gt;John 5:17-18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But He answered them, “My Father is working until now, and I Myself am working.” For this reason, therefore the Ioudaioi were seeking all the more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with His assertion in the synagogue at Nazareth, it is a mistake to say that Jesus never claimed to be God or never claimed to be the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our tour leader Rich says, “He does this a lot – He just does it Jewish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and I might miss the nuanced references but the Jews did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to be sure we don’t miss it, John clarifies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, from the Ioudaioi’s perspective, Jesus was breaking the sabbath. Jesus was not actually breaking the Sabbath just like he was not actually a blasphemer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling Him a sabbath breaker and blasphemer were attempts to discredit what Jesus was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fear of who Jesus was, not what he was saying or doing or when he was doing them, that was the bigger threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Father does not rest from being the Father on Shabbat. His work continues: babies are birthed and circumcised on Shabbat, the temple services continue on Shabbat, and if need be, lives were rescued and emergency medical attention provided on Shabbat. None of these were considered Shabbat violations by the Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These might be considered “valid exceptions” to the general rule that one should do no work on Shabbat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we get to the episode of picking grain on Shabbat, it will be clearer that Jesus’ Shabbat healings are not violations, but valid exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding being equal with God, we can read a verse like Philippians 2:6 (did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped) and get confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest explanation is that in terms of His humanity, Jesus is not equal to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In His deity, they absolutely are equals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another narrative theme in John is that Jesus refuses to submit to the authority the Ioudaioi believe they have. Jesus is going to explain where His authority comes from and He will point to three witnesses who support His claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-519-30-chaism&#34;&gt;John 5:19-30 Chaism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chaism is a literary device where similar thoughts, and usually similar if not identical words, are placed in parallel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure starts by working inward; typically an “A” verse or thought, followed by a “B” verse, then “C”, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in the middle, the structure reverses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If C is the middle verse, then there will be a C’ (pronounced, “C prime”), followed by B’, then concluding with A’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many variations but this is the basic gist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaisms can help us read and study a passage as a single unit. Often in verse-by-verse studies, we zero in on individual verses and sometimes can miss the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at this passage in John in view of this parallel structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A (verse 19): Son does only what Father does (nothing of Himself)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B (20-21): Father and Son give life to the dead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C (22-23): Father gave all judgment to the Son&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D (24): Amen, Amen, they will hear and believe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D’ (25): Amen, Amen, they will hear and live&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C’ (26-27): Father made the Son the source of life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B’ (28-29): all will hear His voice and rise from the dead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A’ (30): Son judges like the father (nothing on His own)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can summarize like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A/A’: Jesus is dependent and reliant on His Father and acts according to His will&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B/B’: The Father and Son have resurrection power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C/C’: The Father has fully commissioned the Son to act in the Father’s stead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D/D’: Eternal life, rests on one’s response to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-519-24&#34;&gt;John 5:19-24&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore Jesus answered and was saying to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, unless it is something He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, these things the Son also does in the same way. For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing; and the Father will show Him greater works than these, so that you will be amazed. For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes. For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son, so that all will honor the Son just as they honor the Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him. Truly, truly, I say to you, the one who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s directly addressing the charge of blasphemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s not usurping that which rightfully belongs to God because “Jesus acts only on the Father’s authority and in conjunction with His will.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s claiming to be deity all throughout this passage. “He just does it Jewish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-525-30&#34;&gt;John 5:25-30&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Truly, truly, I say to you, a time is coming and even now has arrived, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He gave to the Son also to have life in Himself; and He gave Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man. Do not be amazed at this; for a time is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear His voice, and will come out: those who did the good deeds to a resurrection of life, those who committed the bad deeds to a resurrection of judgment. I can do nothing on My own. As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is righteous, because I do not seek My own will but the will of Him who sent Me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Son of Man is a messianic title used by Daniel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judgment is in His job description; just not with regard to His first coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sent one is an Apostle, or in Hebrew, a Shaliach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Moses and the prophets were sometimes viewed as God’s agents.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust&#34;&gt;Walking in His dust&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Ambassador. An agent. When people look at the shaliach, they are supposed to see the one who sent the &lt;em&gt;shaliach&lt;/em&gt;, just as the &lt;em&gt;shaliach’s&lt;/em&gt; behavior is supposed to reflect the behavior of the one who sent him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and I are &lt;em&gt;schlicim&lt;/em&gt; for our Messiah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-531-35-johns-courtroom-narrative&#34;&gt;John 5:31-35. John’s Courtroom Narrative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If I alone &lt;strong&gt;testify&lt;/strong&gt; about Myself, My &lt;strong&gt;testimony&lt;/strong&gt; is not true. There is another who &lt;strong&gt;testifies&lt;/strong&gt; about Me, and I know that the testimony which He gives about Me is true. You have sent messengers to John, and he has &lt;strong&gt;testified&lt;/strong&gt; to the truth. But the &lt;strong&gt;testimony&lt;/strong&gt; I receive is not from man, but I say these things so that you may be saved. He was the lamp that was burning and shining, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is speaking of John the Baptist and John 1:19 when the Ioudaioi sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They tolerated John as long as he played in their sandbox; the “brood of vipers” comment probably didn’t go over well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John the Baptizer’s call to repentance served to remind everyone that they, too, had forgot God. Despite being the chosen people, they are not immune from wandering away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man at Bethesda was an example of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus told that man to repent, just as John told his audience to repent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chosen captured the opposing sentiment well in the Nazareth synagogue scene. Many in Jesus’ day felt that they were on the team by virtue of their lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, all need to hear His Voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sometimes focus on our individual relationship with Jesus and disregard the community component of belief. They did the opposite. Both are errors. We forget we are all part of one symbiotic body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first-century oil lamp typically fit in the palm of one’s hand and did not put off that much light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typologically, John’s lamp was only a tiny representation of the true Light that had come into the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the Ioudaioi were hearing Jesus’ words but if they had a rebuttal John did not record it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-536&#34;&gt;John 5:36&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But the testimony I have is greater than the testimony of John; for the works which the Father has given Me to accomplish—the very works that I do—testify about Me, that the Father has sent Me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Father has commissioned Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is claiming to be the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is claiming to be God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This public proclamation probably happened around the same time as the proclamation in Nazareth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is now “going public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The healing of the man earlier in the chapter is evidence that Jesus has God’s approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The miracles are so commonplace to us, but we need to remember a healing like this is similar to when Jesus calmed the storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is exerting unnatural power over something no earthly being has any control over: a body that fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the storm was calmed, the disciples asked, “who then is this?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be our question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the question John the Gospel writer is answering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-537-40&#34;&gt;John 5:37-40&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And the Father who sent Me, He has testified about Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His form. Also you do not have His word remaining in you, because you do not believe Him whom He sent. “You examine the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is those very Scriptures that testify about Me; and yet you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life here is specifically life in the age to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the introduction we talked about a third witness. We have had John the Baptist, The Father, and now we have the Torah of Moses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s sad that so many Christians discount the value of the Old Testament. None other than Jesus says those 39 books are all about Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus might be implying that if they were there when the Torah was given, they would not have believed, exemplifying John 1:14-18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To reject Jesus is to reject the Scriptures.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I had been thinking about what might be our parallel. The Jewish leadership put the rules around Shabbat above the one who created Shabbat. Surely, we must have a parallel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For Evangelicals, I think our closest parallel might actually be the Bible, which I know sounds like heresy, but hear me out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ll use the example of a recent president who walked to a church in Washington and held up a Bible as a photo op. He didn’t read from the Bible, but he held it up like it was the binding and the paper that made it sacred.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I happen to like this President very much so I’m not making a political statement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not the printing or the paper, but it’s the One Whom the text speaks of and points us to that is Sacred.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I love the fact that we say we’re Bible believing Christians, but we probably should say that we are Christ-followers, or Jesus’ disciples.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Believing in the Bible won’t give us eternal life, and that is Jesus point here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Believing in the One Who wrote the Bible will. There’s a difference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Word of God is Jesus, which includes but is not limited to the Bible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I had been a little unsure of this but then I was watching the pastoral commentary on an episode of the chosen where the Evangelical representative said the exact same thing, so I feel like I’m on solid ground here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-541-43&#34;&gt;John 5:41-43&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do not receive glory from people; but I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves. “I have come in My Father’s name, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have come in My Father’s name&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To reject the agent is to reject the sender.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One comes in his own name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Give us Barabbas!” is one example of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Anti-Christ is also not a bad speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an Essene tradition of a “Wicked Priest,” which may be an individual person or a corrupt system claiming to speak and act on behalf of God. The Ioudaioi’s system might fit this description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately we can’t state with exact certainty whom Jesus refers to by the “one in his own name.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ioudaioi, not all Jews but only the corrupt establishment, DO seek power and to be admired by the people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are blind that they do not have the love of God. They think they are “on the team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-544-47&#34;&gt;John 5:44-47&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How can you believe when you accept glory from one another and you do not seek the glory that is from the one and only God? Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; the one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have put your hope. “For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote about Me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a big dig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus says, “You can’t be trusted to make a sound decision about Me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are like politicians or judges who only do what will earn glowing headlines (or worse, bribed to act a certain way) instead of doing what is faithful and just.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, they have a conflict of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if Jesus were inclined to seek their approval (which He isn’t), it would be impossible because of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These words support John 3:17-18&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John 3:17-18 “For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him. [18] “The one who believes in Him is not judged; the one who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There already was a “chief prosecutor of Israel appointed by God Himself. His name was Moses.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses wrote of Jesus in the promise of the woman’s seed (Gen 3:15), the rightful ruler (Gen 49:10), the star from Jacob (Num 24:17), and the prophet to come (Deut 18:18). The Passover lambs foreshadowed the true Passover Lamb who would die so that the nation could be delivered (John 1:29; 1 Cor 5:7; Rev 5:6).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5:1 Next I saw in the right hand of the One sitting on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals; (2) and I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?&amp;rdquo; (3) But no one in heaven, on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or look inside it. (4) I cried and cried, because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look inside it. (5) One of the elders said to me, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t cry. Look, the Lion of the tribe of Y&amp;rsquo;hudah, the Root of David, has won the right to open the scroll and its seven seals.&amp;rdquo; (6) Then I saw standing there with the throne and the four living beings, in the circle of the elders, a Lamb that appeared to have been slaughtered. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the sevenfold Spirit of God sent out into all the earth. (7) He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of the One sitting on the throne. (8) When he took the scroll, the four living beings and the twenty-four elders fell down in front of the Lamb. Each one held a harp and gold bowls filled with pieces of incense, which are the prayers of God&amp;rsquo;s people; (9) and they sang a new song, &amp;ldquo;You are worthy to take the scroll and break its seals; because you were slaughtered; at the cost of blood you ransomed for God persons from every tribe, language, people and nation. (10) You made them into a kingdom for God to rule, cohanim to serve him; and they will rule over the earth.&amp;rdquo; (11) Then I looked, and I heard the sound of a vast number of angels—thousands and thousands, millions and millions! They were all around the throne, the living beings and the elders; (12) and they shouted out, &amp;ldquo;Worthy is the slaughtered Lamb to receive power, riches, wisdom, strength, honor, glory and praise!&amp;rdquo; (13) And I heard every creature in heaven, on earth, under the earth and on the sea—yes, everything in them—saying, &amp;ldquo;To the One sitting on the throne and to the Lamb belong praise, honor, glory and power forever and ever!&amp;rdquo; (14) The four living beings said, &amp;ldquo;Amen!&amp;rdquo; and the elders fell down and worshipped.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-51&#34;&gt;Rev 5:1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next I saw in the right hand of the One sitting on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A seal would have been made of clay (later, wax) with an imprint of authentication
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem, many documents were destroyed, leaving only the clay seals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hundreds of these seals have been found all over Israel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are called LMLK (l&amp;rsquo;melech – to the king)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes they would be tied with a string, with the clay or wax molded around the string – to get to the string, one would need to break the seal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seals still intact let the bearer know that the contents were not altered
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, not added or deleted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Rev 22:18-19 I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, (19) and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This scene resembles when the Torah was given to Moses
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Exo 32:15-16 Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets that were &lt;strong&gt;written on both sides; on the front and on the back they were written&lt;/strong&gt;. (16) The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is also descriptive of legal documents of the ancient world.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keener notes that many such documents had seven seals, which guaranteed no one had open or tampered with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider this passage from Jeremiah:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Jer 32:9-15 “And I bought the field at Anathoth from Hanamel my cousin, and weighed out the money to him, seventeen shekels of silver. (10) I signed the deed, sealed it, got witnesses, and weighed the money on scales. (11) Then I took the sealed deed of purchase, containing the terms and conditions and the open copy. (12) And I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my cousin, in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, and in the presence of all the Judeans who were sitting in the court of the guard. (13) I charged Baruch in their presence, saying, (14) ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, both this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware vessel, that they may last for a long time. (15) For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.’&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The writing on the outside likely provided the terms and conditions for breaking the seals.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ezek 2:9 And when I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me, and behold, a scroll of a book was in it. 10 And he spread it before me. And it had writing on the front and on the back, and there were written on it words of lamentation and mourning and woe. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Zechariah 5:1 Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, a flying scroll! 2 And he said to me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a flying scroll. Its length is twenty cubits, and its width ten cubits.” 3 Then he said to me, “This is the curse that goes out over the face of the whole land. For everyone who steals shall be cleaned out according to what is on one side, and everyone who swears falsely shall be cleaned out according to what is on the other side. 4 I will send it out, declares the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter the house of the thief, and the house of him who swears falsely by my name. And it shall remain in his house and consume it, both timber and stones.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the same &amp;ldquo;Ancient of Days&amp;rdquo; seated on his throne that Daniel and Isaiah saw.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Dan 7:9 “As I looked, thrones were placed, and the Ancient of Days took his seat; his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames; its wheels were burning fire. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Isa 6:1 In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rest of Revelation will describe what happens as the seven seals are removed and the scroll opened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chuck Missler refers to this scroll as the &amp;ldquo;title deed to Earth&amp;rdquo;, and this chapter is &amp;ldquo;the most important escrow closing in history.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other commentators see the &amp;ldquo;Book of Life&amp;rdquo; mentioned in Psalm 139:6, Exodus 32:32, and Revelation 3:5.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Exo 32:32-33 But now, if you will forgive their sin—but if not, please blot me out of your book that you have written.” (33) But the LORD said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me, I will blot out of my book.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-52-4&#34;&gt;Rev 5:2-4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?&amp;rdquo; But no one in heaven, on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or look inside it. I cried and cried, because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look inside it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John apparently has an inkling that this is an extremely important document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A question might be why the One seated on the throne is not worthy
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently, it required a &lt;strong&gt;man&lt;/strong&gt; to open it but, apparently, no &lt;strong&gt;man&lt;/strong&gt; matching the qualifications could be identified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Is 29:1 And the vision of all this has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed. When men give it to one who can read, saying, “Read this,” he says, “I cannot, for it is sealed.”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Dan 12:9 He said, “Go your way, Daniel, for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of the end. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation 5 is a partial fulfillment of these passages that were once sealed but are now about to be unsealed.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lizorkin writes, &amp;ldquo;This vision could be completely original to John but reads a little like an adaptation of both Daniel 7, Ezekiel 2 (and possibly) Isaiah 29.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The book of Ruth provides an example of a kinsman-redeemer, which most scholars believe is essentially what is happening in Revelation 5.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boaz, the goel, the kinsman-Redeemer had to meet the following conditions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had to be a kinsman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had to be able and willing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had to assume all of the obligations of the beneficiary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John weeps because no such redeemer for this particular contract is apparent.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greek has two different words for crying;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One is more of sobbing and is the word used when Jesus wept over the death of Lazarus (John 11:35)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other implies being overcome with grief, as when Jesus wept over Jerusalem (Luke 19:41)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stronger word is used here in Rev 5:4. John was overcome with grief.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is reminiscent of Daniel 7, where Daniel became physically ill
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Dan 7:28 “Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly alarmed me, and my color changed, but I kept the matter in my heart.”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We might find it curious that John did not identify Jesus, the one who loved him, as someone who would have met the terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember, John is receiving this in a vision; in other words, in his vision, he sees himself weeping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He weeps because the fate of God&amp;rsquo;s redemptive program hangs in the balance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All throughout the bible, we see Satan trying to thwart the plan of God.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples are the Garden of Eden, the Tower of Babel, the attempts to wipe out Judah&amp;rsquo;s and later David&amp;rsquo;s line, Jesus&amp;rsquo; temptations, and ultimately the Cross.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a moment, John is terrified that Satan had succeeded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-55&#34;&gt;Rev 5:5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the elders said to me, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t cry. Look, the Lion of the tribe of Y&amp;rsquo;hudah, the Root of David, has won the right to open the scroll and its seven seals.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are all Jewish titles
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-trib dispensationalists (e.g. Missler) note the 24 titles used of Jesus in chapters 1-3 apply to Him in His role as revealed to the church. From Chapter 4 on in Revelation, only Jewish titles are used, suggesting a distinction between Israel and the Church&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opponents of this viewpoint would cite Roman&amp;rsquo;s 11 where gentiles are &amp;ldquo;grafted-in&amp;rdquo; to Israel, as a suggestion that there is no such thing as a different dispensation called &amp;ldquo;the church age.&amp;rdquo; We are one body, in which there is neither Jew nor Gentile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that both of these camps at least deny Replacement Theology by recognizing Israel&amp;rsquo;s place in God&amp;rsquo;s program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lion of the tribe of Judah
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Gen 49:9 Judah is a lion&amp;rsquo;s cub; from the prey, my son, you have gone up. He stooped down; he crouched as a lion and as a lioness; who dares rouse him? The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler&amp;rsquo;s staff from between his feet, until tribute (or &amp;ldquo;Shiloh&amp;rdquo;) comes to him; and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewish sages have long interpreted this as a prophecy of the Messiah&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;scepter&amp;rdquo; was viewed as the ability of the nation to carry out capital punishment.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josephus records that when Herod Archelaus was deposed around 6 or 7 AD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At some point after this, the Romans took away the Jews&amp;rsquo; authority to carry out capital punishment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Talmud records weeping, saying &amp;ldquo;Woe unto us for the scepter has departed from Judah and the Messiah has not come!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They believed the word of God had failed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This adds new significance to Luke 2 where Jesus publicly presented himself at the temple at age 12, most likely BEFORE the Sanhedrin was stripped of this power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Root of David
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This terminology comes from Isaiah 11, which describes Messiah as a root of Jessie, king David&amp;rsquo;s father.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah 11 also describes a messianic peace, where Gentiles and a regathered Israel will dwell together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Isaiah 11:1 There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isa 11:10-12 In that day the root of Jesse, who shall stand as a signal for the peoples—of him shall the nations (i.e., &amp;ldquo;gentiles&amp;rdquo;) inquire, and his resting (or &amp;ldquo;dwelling&amp;rdquo;) place shall be glorious. (11) In that day the Lord will extend his hand yet a second time to recover the remnant that remains of his people (Israel), from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the coastlands of the sea. (12) He will raise a signal for the nations and will assemble the banished of Israel, and gather the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is why Matthew and Luke MUST establish Jesus&amp;rsquo; connection to David. Everything hinges upon it
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mat 1:1 The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Luk 1:31-33 And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. (32) He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, (33) and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By His perfect obedience in life and death, Jesus won the victory over our sin and won the right to open the seals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-56&#34;&gt;Rev 5:6&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then I saw standing there with (in the midst of) the throne and the four living beings, in the circle of the elders, a Lamb that appeared to have been slaughtered. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the sevenfold Spirit of God sent out into all the earth&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lamb as it has been slaughtered
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is reminiscent of the Passover sacrifice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Exo 12:21 Then Moses called all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go and select lambs for yourselves according to your clans, and kill the Passover lamb.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The original Passover sacrifice spared the people from the plague
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Exo 12:13 The blood shall be a sign for you, on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague will befall you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the same way, this Lamb will save His people from the plagues that are to come as we progress through revelation.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HOW God chooses to preserve His people is up to Him (maybe rapture, maybe martyrdom, maybe some other form of preservation).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus didn&amp;rsquo;t get a pass from death
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure we should expect a pass through the rapture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember, many of the promises to the overcomers in Chapters 1-3 will happen after our earthly deaths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The famous &amp;ldquo;suffering servant&amp;rdquo; passage of Isaiah 53 also contains a reference to a lamb to be slaughtered (Isa 53:7-8).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John the Baptist described Jesus as the &amp;ldquo;Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world,&amp;rdquo; a remarkable comment as Jesus had not yet been sacrificed (John 1:29).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Jesus institutes Holy Communion, He did so at a Passover seder. The connection of His blood with the Passover Lamb&amp;rsquo;s blood would have been unmistakable for the disciples.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I encourage us all, whenever we hear a reference to being saved by the Blood of Christ, to say to ourselves, &amp;ldquo;oh, just like the Passover Lamb&amp;rsquo;s blood saved the Israelites in Egypt.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A study of the Passover feast, even as it is practiced today, is incredibly worthwhile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that a powerful lion and a slaughtered lamb are just about as opposite as two creatures can be; yet, Jesus is both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put yourself in the position of the early 1st Century followers of Jesus.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which &amp;ldquo;Jesus&amp;rdquo; would you have wanted: the Lion or the Lamb?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be honest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you begin to understand how the Jews of Jesus&amp;rsquo; day thought this couldn&amp;rsquo;t be the same person? There must be two messiahs.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messiah ben Joseph – suffering lamb (which became allegorized as suffering Israel)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messiah ben David – conquering lion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seven Horns, i.e., all-powerful
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horns are a symbol of authority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Psa 75:4-5 I say to the boastful, ‘Do not boast,’ and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horn; (5) do not lift up your horn on high, or speak with haughty neck.’”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus references this power in the Great Commission
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mat 28:18 And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I suspect the &amp;ldquo;Father&amp;rdquo; handing the &amp;ldquo;Son&amp;rdquo; the scroll in the next symbolizes this authority-sharing arrangement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seven Eyes, i.e., all-seeing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Zec 3:9&lt;/strong&gt; For behold, on the stone that I have set before Joshua (the high priest), on a single stone with &lt;strong&gt;seven eyes&lt;/strong&gt;, I will engrave its inscription, declares the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of this land in a single day.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zec 4:10&lt;/strong&gt; For whoever has despised the day of small things shall rejoice, and shall see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. “These &lt;strong&gt;seven&lt;/strong&gt; are the &lt;strong&gt;eyes of the LORD, which range through the whole earth&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sevenfold spirit
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some scholars (including Lancaster) believe the sevenfold spirit is not what we think of as the Holy Spirit, but are the image of the traditional seven archangels of Judaism (Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, Uriel, Saraqael, Raguel, and Remiel).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although cited in the apocryphal Book of Enoch, possible support for this view may be seen at Rev 8:2: &lt;small&gt;Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is perhaps an even deeper significance to John&amp;rsquo;s referencing one who was slaughtered.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As is the case today, a will can only be executed upon the death of the person in question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keener writes, &amp;ldquo;If a (type of) will in in view here, it is significant that it is the lamb &lt;strong&gt;who had been slain&lt;/strong&gt; who is worthy to open it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep in mind that seven times, Paul used the word &amp;ldquo;inheritance&amp;rdquo; to describe a reward for faithfully serving Jesus the Messiah.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Eph 1:11 In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Col 3:24 knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-57-8&#34;&gt;Rev 5:7-8&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of the One sitting on the throne. When he took the scroll, the four living beings and the twenty-four elders fell down in front of the Lamb. Each one held a harp and gold bowls filled with pieces of incense, which are the prayers of God&amp;rsquo;s people;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One like a son of man approaching the Ancient of Days
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Dan 7:13-14 “I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. (14) And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again, this reminds us that we need to hold to &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; understanding of the Trinity very loosely.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus is equal in power and glory to the Father (in other words, Jesus is not a &amp;ldquo;lesser&amp;rdquo; God), yet in some way, He is subordinate and submissive to the Father.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bradford sees a comparison between Messiah receiving the scroll from the Father and Moses receiving the tablets from the Father.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;A prophet like unto Moses&amp;rdquo; was promised&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Deu 18:15 “The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your brothers—it is to him you shall listen.&amp;quot; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We may miss what is going on, but the elders and the four living beings did not!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People in the Bible who bow to angels and other servants of the LORD are usually rebuked.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is one angel who made an exception and he&amp;rsquo;s in a lot of trouble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are bowing because this is not just any &amp;ldquo;one like a son of man,&amp;rdquo; this is God the Son who is taking the scroll from God the Father.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harp
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;1Ch 25:1 David and the chiefs of the service also set apart for the service the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who prophesied with lyres, with harps, and with cymbals. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walton notes that music played an important role in receiving an oracle.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prayers/Incense
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Psa 141:2 Let my prayer be counted as incense before you, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Rev 8:3-4 And another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer, and he was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne, (4) and the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before God from the hand of the angel.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-59-10&#34;&gt;Rev 5:9-10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and they sang a new song, &amp;ldquo;You are worthy to take the scroll and break its seals; because you were slaughtered; at the cost of blood you ransomed for God persons from every tribe, language, people and nation. You made them into a kingdom for God to rule, cohanim to serve him; and they will rule over the earth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New song
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Isa 42:9-12 Behold, the former things have come to pass, and new things I now declare; before they spring forth I tell you of them.” (10) Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise from the end of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that fills it, the coastlands and their inhabitants. (11) Let the desert and its cities lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar inhabits; let the habitants of Sela sing for joy, let them shout from the top of the mountains. (12) Let them give glory to the LORD, and declare his praise in the coastlands.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several times in the Psalms, such as &lt;small&gt; Psa 33:3 Sing to him a new song; play skillfully on the strings, with loud shouts. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blood
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To recap the discussion above, by the blood of the Passover lamb, God delivered the Israelites from bondage to be a kingdom and a priesthood to serve Him and rule the nation.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the blood of Jesus, the Lamb of God, He delivered us from bondage to be a kingdom and a priesthood to serve Him and rule over the earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kingdom
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Exo 19:4-6 ‘You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles&amp;rsquo; wings and brought you to myself. (5) Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; (6) and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Daniel 7:18 But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, forever and ever.’ &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Daniel 7:27 And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;1 Pe 2:9 But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember, the original congregations receiving Revelation were exiled in a thoroughly pagan environment and were suffering varying degrees of persecution.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This passage would remind them that the heavenly congregation stood in solidarity with them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The members of the earthly fellowships will one day rule over the earth despite their present situation which was exactly the opposite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Dead Sea Scrolls contain similar imagery of earthly worshippers envisioning themselves participating in heavenly worship with angels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This vision broke with other Jewish apocalyptic literature which described Israel as inheriting the kingdom and ruling over the nations.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John&amp;rsquo;s revelation has Gentile as well as Jewish believers inheriting and ruling over the nations in the Age to Come.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is represented by the &amp;ldquo;millions and millions&amp;rdquo; in verse 11.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-511-12&#34;&gt;Rev 5:11-12&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then I looked, and I heard the sound of a vast number of angels—thousands and thousands, millions and millions! They were all around the throne, the living beings, and the elders; and they shouted out, &amp;ldquo;Worthy is the slaughtered Lamb to receive power, riches, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and praise!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ten thousands
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Deut 33:2 He said, “The LORD came from Sinai and dawned from Seir upon us; he shone forth from Mount Paran; he came from the ten thousands of holy ones, with flaming fire at his right hand.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the CJB, Stern paraphrases the underlying Greek, which, literally is &amp;ldquo;ten thousands of ten thousands,&amp;rdquo; which is an idiom meaning &amp;ldquo;innumerable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel 7:14 is also in view: &lt;small&gt;&amp;ldquo;all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him&amp;rdquo;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We shouldn&amp;rsquo;t lose sight of the groups of seven, even when the number &amp;ldquo;seven&amp;rdquo; is not enumerated. Note the group of seven praises in verse 12.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-513-14&#34;&gt;Rev 5:13-14&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And I heard every creature in heaven, on earth, under the earth and on the sea—yes, everything in them—saying, &amp;ldquo;To the One sitting on the throne and to the Lamb belong praise, honor, glory and power forever and ever!&amp;rdquo; The four living beings said, &amp;ldquo;Amen!&amp;rdquo; and the elders fell down and worshipped.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every knee shall bow –
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Isa 45:23 By myself I have sworn; from my mouth has gone out in righteousness a word that shall not return: ‘To me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear allegiance.’&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also quoted by Paul in Romans 14:11 and Philippians 2:9-11.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Amen&amp;rdquo; אָמֵן is the one Hebrew word EVERYBODY in almost EVERY LANGUAGE knows!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul exhorts us to remember Jesus in His glorified state
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Php 2:5-11 &lt;strong&gt;Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus&lt;/strong&gt;, (6) who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, (7) but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. (8) And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. (9) Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, (10) so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, (11) and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could ask, &amp;ldquo;Is your Jesus the one still hanging on a cross, or is your Jesus the one, the only one, who is worthy to take the scroll and be worshipped?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now the scene will shift to the physical realm on earth. Many would view this as the &amp;ldquo;Day of the Lord&amp;rdquo;, which is not just a day on the calendar but a period of seven years prophesied by Daniel in Daniel 9.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;genesis-15--a-faith-completed-by-works-james-222&#34;&gt;Genesis 15 – A faith completed by works (James 2:22)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geographic setting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:5.26806in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t provided a specific location for the events in this chapter. Verse 15 references Abraham buried, which we know is Hebron, SW of Jerusalem and Bethlehem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;faith-alone&#34;&gt;Faith Alone?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15 is an important chapter to the Apostolic Writers. Verse 6 contains the famous statement, “He (Abraham) believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This verse is directly referenced in Romans 4, Galatians 3, Hebrews 11, and James 2. This verse, along with Habakkuk 2:4, “The just shall live by faith,” are the verses that sparked the Reformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul spends an entire chapter, Romans 4, developing Abraham’s faith, and, as a compliment, James spends half of chapter two doing the same, but in a slightly different context. The famous “faith without works is dead” passage uses Abraham in Genesis 15 as a backdrop. So we’re going to need to be Bereans (Acts 17;11) and do our homework to piece all of this together to make sure we have a firm grasp of how faith and works go together. This is important because, in my humble opinion, the protestant church has largely gotten it wrong for the past 500 years by teaching “Faith Alone.” That’s not exactly what the Bible teaches. Jesus never says our works don’t matter; in fact, there are multiple passages where He essentially says, “if you love me, you will keep my commands.” (John 14:15, 14:24, 15:10, Mat 28:20, etc.). But as always, don’t believe what I say. Be a Berean and check it out for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is true is the order. Faith comes first, then obedience. We’ll see Abraham’s faith here in Chapter 15, and then we’ll see his obedience, culminating with obedience beyond all understanding in Genesis 22. God delivered the Israelites from Egypt first, then gave them the Torah, the standards of ethical behavior for His people. Jesus first says come to Me you who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest” (Mat 11:28), then he says, “(teach) them to obey all I have commanded” (Mat 28:20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be worth our time to read Romans 4 and James 2:14-26 in conjunction with Genesis 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told, Abraham occurs 75 times in the New Testament, and the events in His life that are referenced the most begin in this chapter. A firm understanding of Chapters 15, 16, 17, 21, and 22 will significantly aid our correct interpretation and application of New Testament teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-151-3&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:1-3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these things, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: “Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.” But Abram said, “O Lord GOD, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?” And Abram said, “Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God communicates in visions. They are distinct from dreams in that the recipient has no doubt the conversation really took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we remember, the chapter and verse breaks are man’s insertions; they are not divinely inspired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are used to “after these things” denoting a scene shift, but this is not to say the events after these things are not related to the events before “these things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we read the Story of Abraham as a continuous narrative, Abraham has just given 10% to Melchizedek and did not keep any spoils for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God viewed this with favor and here says, “because you refused reward from the King of Sodom, your reward from Me will be very great.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham wants to know what has become of the promises of Chapter 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a man had no son, he could legally adopt a servant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite God’s earlier promise, Abraham seems resigned to this course of action, possibly believing that Eliezer is whom God had in mind to continue Abraham’s line all along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, since we know what is about to happen with Isaac, it’s easy for us to see a lack of faith, especially since God specifically said, “your offspring.” We, as disciples, often limit God to what we can see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How patient and faithful would WE be if we were in Abraham’s shoes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliezer means “God is Help” or “God’s helper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four times in John 15, Jesus refers to the Holy Spirit as “the Helper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John 15:26 “But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this discussion when we get to Genesis 24 when the father’s (unnamed) helper goes to fetch a bride for the son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-154-5&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:4-5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And behold, the word of the LORD came to him: “This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir.” And he brought him outside and said, “Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:12 Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as many as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God IS able to number them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalms 147:4 He determines the number of the stars; he gives to all of them their names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 40:26 Lift up your eyes on high and see: who created these? He who brings out their host by number, calling them all by name; by the greatness of his might and because he is strong in power, not one is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God and Abraham had a special relationship. They speak with each other as two friends. In a few chapters, they will negotiate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James 2:23 and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”—and he was called a friend of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-156&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he believed the LORD, and he counted it to him as righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement was very important to Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 4 is Paul’s commentary on Genesis 15:6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 4:13 For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul is saying that as believers, we are to trust in God just as Abraham did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Paul, Abraham didn’t just believe God would provide a literal son in Isaac; Abraham foresaw a special son of His: the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 8:56 “Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day. He saw it and was glad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 3:29 And if you are Christ&amp;rsquo;s, then you are Abraham&amp;rsquo;s offspring, heirs according to promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Paul’s logic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God promised Abraham a seed (seed singular, not seeds plural)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham believed God’s promise regarding the seed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Seed is the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore Abraham believed in the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul used this passage as a proof-text that Gentiles did not need to convert to Judaism to be deemed righteous by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proclamation of Abraham’s faith and declaration of his righteousness came before the covenant sign and commandment to Abraham to circumcise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are deemed righteous first, and then we obey; we don’t obey to attain righteousness. When we fail, we don’t lose our status; when we fail, we realize our dependence on God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is VERY different from saying “works don’t matter at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible doesn’t teach salvation by works; but, it does teach works from salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israelites were delivered from bondage, and THEN they were given the Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James 2:20-24 Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? [You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”—and he was called a friend of God. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One remarkable aspect about the Bible is it seems to anticipate false doctrine – and what is remarkable about man is that we still get it wrong (for example, Luther reportedly said he “had no use for James.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Faith alone” is a core teaching of the Protestant Church, yet it may only be ½ correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note James is not saying “works alone justify.” A person who claims to have faith but no works might be in error about his claim to have faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 3:5-7 Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith— just as Abraham “believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”? Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul makes it clear he is basing his arguments FROM the Torah, not outside of the Torah: Romans 3:31 Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-157-8&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:7-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he said to him, “I am the LORD who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.” But he said, “O Lord GOD, how am I to know that I shall possess it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We call this cognitive dissonance. Abraham’s reality doesn’t match what he believes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can simultaneously believe and doubt, as with the father of the demon-possessed boy in Mark 9:24: Immediately, the father of the child cried out and said, “I believe; help my unbelief!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the overarching test for believers. We believe God is all-good and we believe that God is all powerful, yet evil exists. The martyred saints struggled with this in Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Abraham’s case, God will address Abraham’s desire to “know that I shall possess” with a covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-159-10&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:9-10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” And he brought him all these, cut them in half, and laid each half over against the other. But he did not cut the birds in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This procedure signifies a covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, both parties would divide the sacrifices and then walk between them – we’re going to see something different about this treaty in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cutting in half is symbolic of the curse on the one who violates the treaty. The parties are essentially saying, “may I become like this animal if I break the treaty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parties share a fellowship meal – symbolic of mutual blessings for keeping to the terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1511&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for the Eagle, birds of prey are usually negative in the Bible, as Jesus describes in the Parable of the Four Soils:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 13:4 And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 13:19 When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a direct sense, Abraham is going to have to compete with the enemies listed at the end of the chapter for possession of the land. They have no part in the covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an indirect sense, the birds are the ministers of Satan, ready to attack and defile God’s covenants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Driving the birds away means we need to be vigilant about identifying threats – something Abraham will fail to do in Chapter 16.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1512-14&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:12-14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. And behold, dreadful and great darkness fell upon him. Then the LORD said to Abram, “Know for certain that your offspring will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs and will be servants there, and they will be afflicted for four hundred years. But I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward, they shall come out with great possessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;terrible-darkness&#34;&gt;Terrible darkness?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tradition holds that Abraham was given a vision of all of the suffering of the Jewish people, from Egypt to Auschwitz, but it culminated with a vision of the Messianic Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another possibility Jesus was referencing when He said, “Abraham rejoiced to see My day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;unconditional-covenant&#34;&gt;Unconditional Covenant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many catholic and protestant commentators don’t understand the significance of verse 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common strain of theology goes like this: “Israel forfeited God’s promises because she rejected her Messiah. Those promises now belong to the church.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham was not an active party to the covenant trust agreement – this covenant was UNCONDITIONAL. Abraham, or his offspring Israel, could not violate the terms of the agreement if they tried, including the national rejection of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promises are still in play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church does not replace Israel; the church has an entirely different mission and destiny from national (theological) Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: this does not mean we have to blindly support political Israel – that is a different discussion although eventually theological Israel and political Israel must intersect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMHO we need to get away from blanketly saying this or that group is all good or all bad. There are Good Jews and bad Jews. There are good Palestinians and bad Palestianians. There are Good Christians and bad people who call themselves Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Job is to be bereans and true to the Bible, because of that I can say “my God and my Savior loves Israel so I love Israel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sojourner---messiah&#34;&gt;Sojourner - Messiah&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word is ger, and it refers to something like a resident alien – separated from his own people, living among foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messiah has been a sojourner, a stranger to His own people, living among us gentiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, Messiah will no longer be a sojourner or a stranger and He will inherit everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;400-years&#34;&gt;400 Years?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 7:6 And God spoke to this effect—that his offspring would be sojourners in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and afflict them four hundred years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know 400 years does not refer to the time they were in Egypt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further complicate matters, Exodus 12:40 says they were in Egypt 430 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at the genealogies, only 64 years pass from the time Joseph dies to when Moses is born – Exodus 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to one reckoning, the 400 years of affliction begins when Ishmael mocks/persecutes Isaac in Genesis 21. Then using the ages given in the Bible, it is exactly 400 years until Moses speaks to Pharaoh in Exodus 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30 years before this is when God Gave the promise to Abraham we are studying here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds contrived, Paul evidently confirms the math in Galatians 3 by saying the Torah was given 430 years after the promise to Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 3:16-17 Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, “And to offsprings,” referring to many, but referring to one, “And to your offspring,” who is Christ. This is what I mean: the law, which came 430 years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our presuppositions is that God’s word is infallible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we think we’ve found an error, we are revealing that we don’t really believe Scripture is without error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better to ask, “since the Bible cannot be in error, how is my understanding in error?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1515-16&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:15-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age. And they shall come back here in the fourth generation, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to remember God’s ways our not our ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In part, the reason the Israelites were in Egypt was so the sin of the Amorites would be complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the reason we go through trials is so we can later glorify God through our testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1517--the-torch-is-messiah&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:17 – The Torch is Messiah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the sun had gone down and it was dark, behold, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a foreshadowing of God as the pillar of cloud/pillar of fire in the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 62:1 For Zion&amp;rsquo;s sake I will not keep silent, and for Jerusalem&amp;rsquo;s sake I will not be quiet, until her righteousness goes forth as brightness, and her salvation (Yeshua) as a burning torch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1518-21&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:18-21&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that day, the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your offspring, I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates, the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exodus 12:40-43 The time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt was 430 years. [41] At the end of 430 years, &lt;strong&gt;on that very day,&lt;/strong&gt; all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt&amp;hellip;And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the statute of the Passover…,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to our 400/430 year discussion – if we take Exodus 12 literally, then the day Abraham received this vision was the evening between Nissan 14 and 15; in other words, he received it on Passover (in advance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14/15 Nissan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham slaughtered the animals to make a covenant with the LORD in a great and terrible darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children of Israel slaughtered their Passover lambs in Egypt as the angel of death slew Egypt’s firstborn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messiah suffered and died as our sacrifice, right after He instituted a New Covenant. At sunset, they closed the Master’s tomb (another great and terrible darkness).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all three darkness times a light blazed forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster, “The day of Passover draws a line of connection from Abraham’s covenant to his singular promised Seed, the Messiah.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read/hear the portions&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rev 6:1-17 Next, I watched as the Lamb broke the first of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living beings say in a thundering voice, &amp;ldquo;Go!&amp;rdquo; (2) I looked, and there in front of me was a white horse; its rider had a bow and was given a crown, and he rode off as a conqueror to conquer. (3) When he broke the second seal, I heard the second living being say, &amp;ldquo;Go!&amp;rdquo; (4) Another horse went out, a red one; and its rider was given the power to take peace away from the earth and make people slaughter each other. He was given a great sword. (5) When he broke the third seal, I heard the third living being say, &amp;ldquo;Go!&amp;rdquo; I looked, and there in front of me was a black horse, and its rider held in his hand a pair of scales. (6) Then I heard what sounded like a voice from among the four living beings say, &amp;ldquo;Two pounds of wheat for a day&amp;rsquo;s wages! Six pounds of barley for the same price! But don&amp;rsquo;t damage the oil or the wine!&amp;rdquo; (7) When he broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living being say, &amp;ldquo;Go!&amp;rdquo; (8) I looked, and there in front of me was a pallid, sickly-looking horse. Its rider&amp;rsquo;s name was Death, and Sh&amp;rsquo;ol followed behind him. They were given authority to kill one-quarter of the world by war, by famine, by plagues and with the wild animals of the earth. (9) When the Lamb broke the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been put to death for proclaiming the Word of God, that is, for bearing witness. (10) They cried out in a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;Sovereign Ruler, HaKadosh, the True One, how long will it be before you judge the people living on earth and avenge our blood?&amp;rdquo; (11) Each of them was given a white robe; and they were told to wait a little longer, until the full number of their fellow-servants should be reached, of their brothers who would be killed, just as they had been. (12) Then I watched as he broke the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake, the sun turned black as sackcloth worn in mourning, and the full moon became blood-red. (13) The stars fell from heaven to earth just as a fig tree drops its figs when shaken by a strong wind. (14) The sky receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place. (15) Then the earth&amp;rsquo;s kings, the rulers, the generals, the rich and the mighty—indeed, everyone, slave and free—hid himself in caves and among the rocks in the mountains, (16) and said to the mountains and rocks, &amp;ldquo;Fall on us, and hide us from the face of the One sitting on the throne and from the fury of the Lamb! (17) For the Great Day of their fury has come, and who can stand?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;four-horseman-of-the-apocalypse&#34;&gt;Four Horseman of the Apocalypse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The beginning of the woes that will unfold throughout the rest of the book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talmud discusses a seven-year period of calamity followed by the establishment of the Messianic kingdom. There is a general expectation that before the coming of the Messiah, there will be a period of tribulation leading up to the final redemption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation has echoes of Exodus and the plagues on Egypt, with the deliverance of God&amp;rsquo;s people through the plagues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horsemen imagery appears twice in Zechariah
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Zec 1:8-11 “I saw in the night, and behold, a man riding on a red horse! He was standing among the myrtle trees in the glen, and behind him were red sorrel, and white horses. (9) Then I said, ‘What are these, my lord?’ The angel who talked with me said to me, ‘I will show you what they are.’ (10) So the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, ‘These are they whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.’ (11) And they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees, and said, ‘We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth remains at rest.’&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Zec 6:1-8 Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains. And the mountains were mountains of bronze. (2) The first chariot had red horses, the second black horses, (3) the third white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses—all of them strong. (4) Then I answered and said to the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” (5) And the angel answered and said to me, “These are going out to the four winds of heaven (cf. Rev 7:1), after presenting themselves before the Lord of all the earth. (6) The chariot with the black horses goes toward the north country, the white ones go after them, and the dappled ones go toward the south country.” (7) When the strong horses came out, they were impatient to go and patrol the earth. And he said, “Go, patrol the earth.” So they patrolled the earth. (8) Then he cried to me, “Behold, those who go toward the north country have set my Spirit at rest in the north country.”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both passages describe members of the divine council sent out to patrol the earth and report back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most ancient cultures had legends of divine judgments such as war and famine.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indeed, Jesus predicted these in the Olivet Discourse:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mat 24:6-8 And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet. (7) For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. (8) All these are but the beginning of the birth pains.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a sense, all four horsemen (plus the 5th seal of martyrdom) have been at work throughout human history, particularly in the 20th century.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hence, the comparison to a woman in labor, with increasing contractions.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus says not to be alarmed, (24:6), but instead, we need to get excited!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Luke 21:28 Now when these things begin to take place, straighten up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-61-first-seal&#34;&gt;Rev 6:1 First Seal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Next I watched as the Lamb broke the first of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living beings say in a thundering voice, &amp;ldquo;Go!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An interesting point is that the horsemen are not part of the document itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The document cannot be opened and read until all the seals are broken (i.e. after the seventh seal is broken in Revelation 8:1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some interpret the document as the redemption of man and earth, but just like the redemption of Israel from Egypt, judgment, and deliverance from the oppressors was required first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember, Jesus is opening the seals in front of the Elders, the four living creatures and &amp;ldquo;millions and millions&amp;rdquo;, perhaps suggesting the heavenly witnesses mentioned in Deuteronomy and Psalms.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deu 30:19&lt;/strong&gt; I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Therefore choose life, that you and your offspring may live,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psa 50:4&lt;/strong&gt; He calls to the heavens above and to the earth, that he may judge his people:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missler pointed out that when the elders speak, the subject is heaven but when the living creatures speak, the subject is earth.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster adds, saying that the command could be translated as &amp;ldquo;Come!&amp;rdquo;, meaning come down from the heavenly realm and go down to earth.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I looked, and there in front of me was a white horse; its rider had a bow and was given a crown; and he rode off as a conqueror to conquer.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential anti-Roman imagery here.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The biggest threat to the Roman Empire was the Parthians, who were known as being hyper-skilled in archery and, according to Keener, they typically rode white horses
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may have heard the phrase &amp;ldquo;the Parthian shot&amp;rdquo; (aka the &amp;lsquo;parting&amp;rsquo; shot).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Parthians could bring down a bird in flight, right or left-handed, even while facing backward on a horse at full gallop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Wikipedia, the stirrup had not yet been invented, so this was all leg and core strength.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When they shot at their enemies while retreating or faking a retreat, it became known as the Parthian Shot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somewhere along the line, this got misunderstood as a &amp;ldquo;parting&amp;rdquo; shot, which still fits as a metaphor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an aside, one reason Herod and all Jerusalem &amp;ldquo;was in an uproar&amp;rdquo; in Matthew 2:3 could have been that they suspected the visit of the eastern Magi was the beginning of a Parthian invasion (three guys on camels would not have caused this fear).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;identity-of-rider&#34;&gt;Identity of Rider?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some commentators see Jesus here as the man with the crown on a white horse.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As Missler says, &amp;ldquo;This guy keeps bad company (the other three horses). Christ is opening the seals; He is not inside them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some other commentators say this is the gospel message going out. This is also unlikely, given that the other three riders bring death and destruction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some have also suggested that this is the false Messiah on a white horse with a crown (we will see the REAL Messiah on a white horse in Chapter 19).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, this rider doesn&amp;rsquo;t conquer by war because he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He deceives the people by pretending to come in peace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This crown is the &lt;em&gt;stephanos&lt;/em&gt;, the victor&amp;rsquo;s wreath, not the &lt;em&gt;diadem&lt;/em&gt; that Jesus will wear, indicating he&amp;rsquo;s the sovereign, reigning king.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He carries a bow just like Nimrod the hunter did; Nimrod was the first global deceiver (the first human one anyway). Genesis 10.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, this view is also potentially troublesome when we consider that Jesus is the one ostensibly sending the antichrist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is best to consider the riders as similar to the &amp;ldquo;destroyer/death angel&amp;rdquo; of Exodus 12:23 – it is an otherwise unidentified supernatural (angelic) being sent to carry out God&amp;rsquo;s judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;other-notes&#34;&gt;Other notes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hebrew word (קֶשֶׁת) is used either for the bow as a weapon or the bow as the sign of the covenant with Noah (Gen 9:13).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The conquest may be a seemingly peaceful treaty, or it could be a weapon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In any case, the ancient readers would have understood that this horseman represented conquest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While &amp;ldquo;Sword, feminine, and pestilence&amp;rdquo; are frequent idioms throughout the Bible, the prophets did not apparently see the false white horse.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jer 14:12; Jer 24:10; Jer 27:8; Eze 6:11; Eze 7:15; Eze 12:16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose sword, feminine, and pestilence are external threats. In that case, the false white horse possibly represents the enemy within – the enemy we welcome into our ecclesia with open arms but who is only there to conquer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster: this is the spirit of conquest that has always existed throughout humanity,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; perhaps taking a specific form in the final days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-63-4-red&#34;&gt;Rev 6:3-4 Red&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;When he broke the second seal, I heard the second living being say, &amp;ldquo;Go!&amp;rdquo; Another horse went out, a red one; and its rider was given the power to take peace away from the earth and make people slaughter each other. He was given a great sword&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mat 24:10  And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note &amp;ldquo;given the power&amp;rdquo; – all horsemen have to have God&amp;rsquo;s permission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red has long been associated with war – Mars was the Roman god of war. Hence Mars is the &amp;ldquo;red planet.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later in Revelation, we see the red dragon (Rev 12:3) and the red beast (Rev 17:3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster: this is the spirit of war, including civil war-brother against brother. It unleashes the worst in man, as we saw during the 20th century.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stern sees the 1st and 2nd seals as both representing war, but in two different aspects.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st seal – subjecting peoples one to another&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2nd seal – hate between nations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-65-6-famine&#34;&gt;Rev 6:5-6 Famine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When he broke the third seal, I heard the third living being say, &amp;ldquo;Go!&amp;rdquo; I looked, and there in front of me was a black horse, and its rider held in his hand a pair of scales.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Then I heard what sounded like a voice from among the four living beings say, &amp;ldquo;Two pounds of wheat for a day&amp;rsquo;s wages! Six pounds of barley for the same price! But don&amp;rsquo;t damage the oil or the wine!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The scales suggest rationing – every ounce of product sold was to be carefully measured.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keener suggests the price of the wheat is 10x what it should be, so a family would be forced to buy the cheaper and less nourishing barley.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we hear &amp;ldquo;pounds,&amp;rdquo; in our minds, we think of weight, not volume.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wheat is usually sold by volume: such as one quart of wheat and three quarts of barley.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During times of famine, selling bread by weight is attested to in the Scripture.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lev 26:26 When I break your supply of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in a single oven and shall dole out your bread again by weight, and you shall eat and not be satisfied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eze 4:10 And your food that you eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day; from day to day you shall eat it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day&amp;rsquo;s wage – literally a denarius. We see this unit of measure frequently in the Gospels.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barley and wheat were basic necessities; oil and wine were luxuries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Messianic Era, there will be an abundance of Wine and Oil
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To Lancaster, the fact that the oil and wine are not touched suggests a short duration of the famine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These crops would take many years to replace, likely jeopardizing availability in the messianic kingdom if they were touched.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josephus records that famine killed more Jews during the First Jewish War than the Romans. At one point, when the Romans burst into the homes in Jerusalem, they were surprised to find most were already dead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was around 20-25 years before Revelation was written, so it would have still been on the minds of many of the recipients (like the mention of a &amp;ldquo;plane crashing into a building&amp;rdquo; would still be a fresh memory for many of us).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-67-8-pale&#34;&gt;Rev 6:7-8 Pale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;When he broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living being say, &amp;ldquo;Go!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I looked, and there in front of me was a pallid, sickly-looking horse. Its rider&amp;rsquo;s name was Death, and Sh&amp;rsquo;ol followed behind him. They were given authority to kill one-quarter of the world by war, by famine, by plagues and with the wild animals of the earth.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Revelation 1, Messiah holds the keys to Death and Hades. He has full authority over them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The translators have a tough time describing this color
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here the Greek word is &lt;em&gt;chloros&lt;/em&gt; (chlorine, chlorophyll) – like a pale green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/7a75ef15bb6ad82e80e912ced778c044.png&#34; width=&#34;20%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Zech 1, it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;sorrell&amp;rdquo; (pale brown); Zech 6: &amp;ldquo;dappled&amp;rdquo; (patchy, spotty), in CJB/ESV it&amp;rsquo;s pallid/pale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In any case, &amp;ldquo;sickly&amp;rdquo; is the thought (like the nauseated emoji).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Eze 14:21 “For thus says the Lord GOD: How much more when I send upon Jerusalem my four disastrous acts of judgment, sword, famine, wild beasts, and pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast! &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Eze 5:15-17 You shall be a reproach and a taunt, a warning and a horror, to the nations all around you, when I execute judgments on you in anger and fury, and with furious rebukes—I am the LORD; I have spoken— when I send against you the deadly arrows of famine, arrows for destruction, which I will send to destroy you, and when I bring more and more famine upon you and break your supply of bread. I will send famine and wild beasts against you, and they will rob you of your children. Pestilence and blood shall pass through you, and I will bring the sword upon you. I am the LORD; I have spoken.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Death claims the body, and Sheol/Hades claims the soul. Potentially this is the death and destruction that result from the first three seals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missler says don&amp;rsquo;t discount microscopic &amp;ldquo;wild animals.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And he passed away before COVID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-5th-seal-martyrs&#34;&gt;The 5th Seal: Martyrs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-69&#34;&gt;Rev 6:9&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;When the Lamb broke the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been put to death for proclaiming the Word of God, that is, for bearing witness.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Lev 17:11  For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it for you on the altar to make atonement for your souls, for it is the blood that makes atonement by the life.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messianic Rabbi Lichtenstein explains: &amp;ldquo;This is in accordance with the Jewish faith that says the souls of the righteous who were killed are like offerings upon the heavenly altar in the heavenly temple.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just as Messiah did&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Hebrews 9:23-24: Thus, it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God has not forgotten about those in Asia martyred for His name; they will be vindicated (those who perished under persecutions of Nero, Jewish War, Domitian, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here, the martyrs are viewed as sacrifices just like the Passover Lamb of Revelation 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Lev 5:9 and he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, while the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John apparently can &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; souls in his visionary state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the first four seals parallel Matthew 24:5-8, note Matthew 24:9: Mat 24:9 “Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name&amp;rsquo;s sake.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-610&#34;&gt;Rev 6:10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;They cried out in a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;Sovereign Ruler, HaKadosh, the True One, how long will it be before you judge the people living on earth and avenge our blood?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Bible, blood guilt is a much larger issue than many realize.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It stains the entire community, and God will avenge it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a sense, their shed blood is crying out just like Able&amp;rsquo;s in &lt;small&gt; Gen 4:10 And the LORD said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother&amp;rsquo;s blood is crying to me from the ground. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Mat 23:35 so that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the arrangement of the Hebrew Bible, Zechariah is the last recorded martyr in 2 Chronicles 24.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Deu 32:43 “Rejoice with him, O heavens; bow down to him, all gods, for he avenges the blood of his children and takes vengeance on his adversaries. He repays those who hate him and cleanses his people&amp;rsquo;s land.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Psa 79:10 Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” Let the avenging of the outpoured blood of your servants be known among the nations before our eyes! &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;How long?&amp;rdquo; (in the sense of &amp;ldquo;when will You make things right?&amp;rdquo;) is a common refrain, particularly in the Psalms.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Psa 13:1-2 To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. How long, O LORD? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me? (2) How long must I take counsel in my soul and have sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me? &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Zec 1:12 Then the angel of the LORD said, ‘O LORD of hosts, how long will you have no mercy on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, against which you have been angry these seventy years?’ &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;How long?&amp;rdquo; could also mean duration.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Isa 6:11-13 Then I said, “How long, O Lord?” And he said: “Until cities lie waste without inhabitant, and houses without people, and the land is a desolate waste, (12) and the LORD removes people far away, and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land. (13) And though a tenth remain in it, it will be burned again, like a terebinth or an oak, whose stump remains when it is felled.” The holy seed is its stump. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good general reminder is that vengeance is God&amp;rsquo;s option, not ours.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Rom 12:19 Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Mat 5:44-45 But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-611&#34;&gt;Rev 6:11&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Each of them was given a white robe; and they were told to wait a little longer, until the full number of their fellow servants should be reached, of their brothers who would be killed, just as they had been.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This verse reminds us that we need to have the Heavenly perspective, not an earthly one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It may appear that the enemy is winning, but that&amp;rsquo;s a façade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The martyrs receive white robes; in other words, they are pure and ceremonially clean in God&amp;rsquo;s eyes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Rev 17:6 And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints, the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I marveled greatly. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; Rev 18:24 And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all who have been slain on earth.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ultimately, unlike the immediate unleashing of the judgment of the first four seals, the 5th seal promises judgment, but judgment is deferred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reminiscent of Genesis 15:14-16: &lt;small&gt;But I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward they shall come out with great possessions. As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age. And they shall come back here in the fourth generation, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Son of David will not come until the blood of the last martyr has been shed.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White robe is possibly a temporary covering until the martyrs receive their outer bodies to be restored in the resurrection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;timing-questions&#34;&gt;Timing questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some scholars see the seals, trumpets, and bowls as sequential, one happening after the other in chronological order, other scholars see amplification or parallelism. In other words, the seven trumpets describe the tribulation, then the trumpets and then the bowels/vials go back and pick out different aspects of the tribulation. Scholars in this camp note that the 6th and 7th seals, the 6th and 7th trumpets, and the 6th and 7th bowls all seem to be referencing the end of this age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, as opposed to all seals being yet future, some scholars (e.g., Lancaster citing Lichtenstein) see the first five seals as already opened, while the 6th and 7th are yet future. This is based on a reading of the order given in Matthew 24 and Luke 21, as well as by simple observation of the world around us throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24:6 talks about wars and rumors of wars but says the &amp;ldquo;end is not yet.&amp;rdquo; As we looked at before, in the Luke account, Jesus says to &amp;ldquo;look up, for your redemption draws near.&amp;rdquo; Remember, he was telling that to His 1st-century disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have the Gospel going to the ends of the earth, which presumably would need to happen before the &amp;ldquo;restrainer&amp;rdquo; is removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 24:9 talks about martyrs, which is the 5th seal. We can see that most of the calamities described thus far in Matthew 24 have been happening. Then we have a passage on the Abomination of Desolation (24:15-28), which has NOT happened yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in Matthew 24:29, we see what appears to be the 6th seal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mat 24:29 “Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.&amp;quot; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, right now we are in between the opening of the 5th and 6th seals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-sixth-seal&#34;&gt;The Sixth seal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-612-14&#34;&gt;Rev 6:12-14&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Then I watched as he broke the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake, the sun turned black as sackcloth worn in mourning, and the full moon became blood-red.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;The stars fell from heaven to earth just as a fig tree drops its figs when shaken by a strong wind.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The sky receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we talked about in chapters 2-3, earthquakes were prevalent, and often quite destructive in Asia Minor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st of three earthquakes in Revelation: Rev 6:12; Rev 11:13;Rev 16:18-19.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Darkness recalls the ten plagues.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Exo 10:21 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, a darkness to be felt.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &amp;ldquo;darkness to be felt&amp;rdquo; is not natural darkness. There is much more going on here than merely the absence of light.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similar descriptions appear in Isaiah, Ezekiel, Amos, and Daniel
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Isa 13:9-10 Behold, the day of the LORD comes, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger, to make the land a desolation and to destroy its sinners from it. (10) For the stars of the heavens and their constellations will not give their light; the sun will be dark at its rising, and the moon will not shed its light. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Eze 32:7-8 When I blot you (speaking of Egypt) out, I will cover the heavens and make their stars dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give its light. (8) All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over you, and put darkness on your land, declares the Lord GOD. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Amo 8:9 “And on that day,” declares the Lord GOD, “I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Dan 8:10 It grew great, even to the host of heaven. And some of the host and some of the stars it threw down to the ground and trampled on them. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As this is apocalyptic literature, we can&amp;rsquo;t necessarily assume literal astronomical events. These could simply be hyperbolic descriptions of a general cosmic judgment or allegories, such as the stars cast down representing fallen angels. In any case, whatever it is, believers will recognize it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What a &amp;ldquo;coincidence.&amp;rdquo; Matthew 24 also mentions a fig tree.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mat 24:32-35 “From the fig tree, learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near. (33) So also, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, at the very gates. (34) Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. (35) Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Isaiah also references a fig tree, and the sky rolled up like a scroll: Isa 34:4 All the host of heaven shall rot away, and the skies roll up like a scroll. All their host shall fall, as leaves fall from the vine, like leaves falling from the fig tree. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possibly, Isaiah 40:22 and Psalm 104:2 are in view. These verses describe the skies as being like a tent or canopy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mountains and Islands are likely the gentile kingdoms/nations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many ancient cultures had sky deities, so rolling up the sky could be an act of judgment against these pagan gods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-615-17&#34;&gt;Rev 6:15-17&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Then the earth&amp;rsquo;s kings, the rulers, the generals, the rich and the mighty—indeed, everyone, slave and free—hid himself in caves and among the rocks in the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks, &amp;ldquo;Fall on us, and hide us from the face of the One sitting on the throne and from the fury of the Lamb!&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;For the Great Day of their fury has come, and who can stand?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judgment is not only for the elite. All enemies of God will be punished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The enemies of God hiding in caves to escape His wrath recurs throughout the Scriptures.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Jos 10:16-19 These five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah. (17) And it was told to Joshua, “The five kings have been found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.” (18) And Joshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave and set men by it to guard them, (19) but do not stay there yourselves. Pursue your enemies; attack their rear guard. Do not let them enter their cities, for the LORD your God has given them into your hand.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Isa 2:19 And people shall enter the caves of the rocks and the holes of the ground, from before the terror of the LORD, and from the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Hos 10:8 The high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed. Thorn and thistle shall grow up on their altars, and they shall say to the mountains, “Cover us,” and to the hills, “Fall on us.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who can stand?&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Joe 2:11 The LORD utters his voice before his army, for his camp is exceedingly great; he who executes his word is powerful. For the day of the LORD is great and very awesome; who can endure it? &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mal 3:2 But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner&amp;rsquo;s fire and like fullers&amp;rsquo; soap. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;fury of the Lamb&amp;rdquo; is a contradiction in the natural world, but our Lamb is also a Lion in the heavenly realm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Great Day&amp;rdquo; = Day of the Lord, mentioned frequently in the Bible.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selected Old Testament: Isa 2:12; Jer 46:10; Zep_1:18; Zep 2:2-3; Lam 2:22&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selected New Testament: Rom 2:5,; 2 Th 2:2; 2 Pe 3:10; 1 Co 1:8; 2 Co 1:14; Php 1:10; Rev 16:14; Mat 10:15; 2 Pe 2:9; 1 Jn 4:17&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;closing-thoughts&#34;&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These next sections are given so that we may recognize what is called the &amp;ldquo;principal of expositional constancy.&amp;rdquo;  The Bible is entirely consistent.  Despite being written by over 40 human authors over thousands of years, it is one skillfully designed message from our creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;six-followed-by-a-rest&#34;&gt;Six followed by a rest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In chapter 6, we have six of the seven scrolls broken&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seventh will not be broken until chapter 8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The theme of &amp;ldquo;six of something followed by a rest&amp;rdquo; frequently occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Six days of creation, followed by the seventh day, which never technically was completed (there was no &amp;ldquo;and there was evening and morning, seventh-day&amp;rdquo; verse).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Six days shall you work followed by the seventh day of rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In chapter 7, we will have that rest before the seventh scroll is broken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will be a similar break between the 6th and 7th trumpets.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sixth trumpet is in 9:14&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seventh trumpet is in 11:15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Luke 21:12 begins with &amp;ldquo;Before these things…&amp;rdquo;. Luke 21:12-24 appears to be describing the first Jewish war (66-72) and, specifically, the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE. In other words, the events in 12-24 happen first, followed by the events in verses 21:8-11 and 25-33.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;similarity-to-the-plagues-of-egypt&#34;&gt;Similarity to the Plagues of Egypt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final redemption will be prefaced by the same types of calamities that God brought upon Egypt, except this time, the plagues will be poured out upon the entire earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a moment in a Jewish Passover Seder where they recite the ten plagues, they spill ten drops of wine from the 3rd cup. This reminds them that, although the Passover is overall a joyous occasion and reason to celebrate, it comes at the expense of others. Proverbs 24:17 says, &amp;ldquo;when your enemy falls, do not rejoice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Messianic Jews and gentile believers who participate in a Passover Seder, the drops of blood have added significance as they directly relate to Yeshua, who shed His blood for us. Mat 26:27-29 And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, “Drink of it, all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father&amp;rsquo;s kingdom.” He said this over the 3rd cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often think of prophecy as prediction followed by fulfillment. There is also a very real sense where prophecy is pattern. Abraham acted out a prophecy when he started to sacrifice Isaac. On that very same hill in Jerusalem, another Father WOULD sacrifice His Son. It has been suggested that Abraham KNEW he was acting out prophecy. Gen 22:14 So Abraham called the name of that place, “The LORD will provide”; as it is said to this day, “On the mount of the LORD &lt;strong&gt;it shall be provided&lt;/strong&gt;.” Note the &amp;ldquo;future&amp;rdquo; tense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;opening-thoughts&#34;&gt;Opening thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham has several decision points in this chapter. As we work through, ask yourself what would you have done if you were Abraham and why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, while an in-depth study of the various issues Paul addresses in Galatians is beyond our scope, Paul will use Hagar versus Sarah and Ishmael vs Isaac as typological models. The greater our understanding of Genesis chapters 16-21, the better we will be able to follow Paul’s rather complex arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:3.68616in;height:5.28283in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schlaegel, author of the Satellite Bible Atlas writes, “Despite the promises made in chapter 15, in chapter 16, we see what can happen when we get impatient with God.  Abram went into Hagar and she became pregnant.  This lead to strife between Sarai and Hagar and Hagar decides to flee.  God tells her that Ishmael will be blessed (though he will be a &amp;ldquo;wild ass of a man&amp;rdquo;) and she should return.  We aren&amp;rsquo;t told exactly where this happens but it is along the &amp;ldquo;Way of Shur&amp;rdquo;”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-161-2&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:1-2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Sarai, Abram&amp;rsquo;s wife, had borne him no children. She had a female Egyptian servant whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said to Abram, “Behold now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Go in to my servant; it may be that I shall obtain children by her.” And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A maidservant was a legal extension of her owner, so legally and technically, the result of the procedure Sarai suggested would have counted as Sarai’s offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Sarai’s defense, she probably felt like the one who was responsible for the unfulfilled promise and she was well past child-bearing age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going in to someone who is not your wife sounds odd to us but Sarai’s logic is no different than adoption, where two surrogate parents were involved with the conception or artificial insemination where one surrogate parent is involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a way to build a family with natural methods fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Sarai showed a lack of faith – it is God’s prerogative to open closed wombs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this method was a reasonable option in that day, In Abrahams&amp;rsquo;s case it is different because he was given a specific promise by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many poor choices, this one “seemed like a good idea at the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whose voice SHOULD Abraham have been listening to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we doubt God and act in the flesh, we “sire an Ishmael.” How many of us have a lot of little Ishmaels running around?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a socially acceptable arrangement in the Ancient world, but I’m reminded of the phrase, “just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, God calls us to a higher standard than the society around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; major test, according to Maimonides, a traditional Jewish commentator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the test was the long wait for the birth of a promised son, not being presented with Hagar (but we can see how impatience results in more tests, and often more opportunities to fail those tests).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want a child, and now look. My wife gives me option B.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing really well in chapters 13-15, Abraham blows it on multiple levels here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wish we could have a solid trend of growth, like a chart that consistently goes “up and to the right,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our lives resemble a stock chart more than a trend line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up and down; a good quarter, followed by a not-so-good quarter, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t help seeing some parallels between Sarai and Eve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text doesn’t say that Satan prompted Sarai, but it is safe to say the decision was not from God, and at least in an indirect sense, her decision was from the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God spoke through Adam and Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan spoke through Eve and Sarai (if only indirectly)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam listened to Eve, when He knew what God has said about the Tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham listened to Sarai when he knew what God had said about offspring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last two chapters, the Divine Narrator wants us to know the geographic origin of the two servants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that wherever Abraham goes, he accumulates more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Haran, it was Lot; in Damascus, it was Eliezer; and in Egypt, it was Hagar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wasn’t supposed to be in Haran&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was told to leave his father’s country and his family and head to a place God showed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lot was a repeated source of grief for Abram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was in Damascus because he was doing a righteous deed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was Lot’s kinsman redeemer and went after a lost sheep just like our Kinsman Redeemer pursued us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliezer of Damascus was a source of blessing for Abraham, which we will see in Genesis 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was not supposed to be in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God showed him Canaan, not Egypt; going to Egypt demonstrated a lack of faith in God’s promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He accumulated Hagar, who will be a source of grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hagar’s offspring and Sarah’s offspring have been clashing ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust-1&#34;&gt;Walking in His Dust #1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talmidim demonstrate patience and self-control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gal 5:22-23&lt;/em&gt; But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, when God has given us a promise, we wait on Him&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goals and aspirations are great things if they are consistent with God’s purposes for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to be content to wait for Him to bring those purposes to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is something God has placed on our heart, getting out in front of Him will only mess it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one sense, it’s natural to ask, “is there something I’m missing? Something I’m not doing that I should be doing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If God opens a door, then I’ll go through; but I’m learning to be content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is there may be open doors that God hasn’t opened – that was Abraham’s test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We must make sure we’re only moving out when He says “move out.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram&amp;rsquo;s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, and gave her to Abram, her husband, as a wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hagar, now a concubine, was not a full-status wife, so in the ancient world, this would not be viewed as polygamy.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years had passed since Abraham first heard from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and I get impatient when we don’t hear from God right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to wait on God, but can be disastrous when we don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this comes an ancient tradition that after a woman has gone childless for 10 years, her husband is obligated to marry another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-164&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, we have a negative connotation of “mistress,” so this phrasing is easy to misinterpret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s NOT that Sarah looking with contempt on Hagar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the other way around; Hagar’s mistress, i.e. superior, is Sarah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might say Hagar was taking a victory lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a cultural context, she may have equated herself as a wife of equal standing with Sarai, when she wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was in a lower social order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is the first recorded love triangle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this included a threat that Hagar was not going to give her son to Sarai as per the arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition tells us what Hagar said: She said, “This Sarai… her conduct in secret is not like her conduct in public. She shows herself as if she is a righteous woman, but she is not a righteous woman, for she did not merit to conceive all these years, whereas I have conceived from the first union.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (Genesis Rabbah 45:3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, with seemingly fanciful interpretations like these, our western mind wants to ask, “is this really true?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably not, but that’s not the point. Pastors use illustrations in sermons today; I’m sure every one is not 100% historically accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fill in gaps with educated guesses and speculations; Jewish commentary practices allow for a lot more creativitiy than our seminaries do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-165-6&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:5-6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong done to me be on you! I gave my servant to your embrace, and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked on me with contempt. May the LORD judge between you and me!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Abram said to Sarai, “Behold, your servant is in your power; do to her as you please.” Then Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to say, “this was YOUR idea, Sarai!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see two sides to Abram’s response&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. He failed to lead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible paints a picture at the very beginning of the book that the husband/father is supposed to be the “CEO” of the family organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam and Eve – Adam let his wife make a bad decision without consulting him. Did they not foster mutual accountability in Eden?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah led his family on to the ark, but he didn’t lead once they were off the ark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, Abraham deferred to Sarai’s judgment twice (verse 2 and here at verse 6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham is the one who had the discussion with God, not Sarah. He needed to be more of a leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. If Hagar was acting like she was a full status wife, Abram affirming that Hagar is still Sarai’s subordinate. So potentially, in deferring to Sarai he didn’t make a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps both are true. A good Berean attempts to see more than one side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a theme that will repeat in literature of the lower-status person having more than the upper-class person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole drama of the Count of Monte Cristo is based on this theme (and also a love triangle).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowly Hagar had more than wealthy Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, in God’s economy, the first shall be last and the last shall be first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible says, this time, Hagar left and not that she was cast out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust-2&#34;&gt;Walking in His Dust #2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We must speak out in defense of someone who is being mistreated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish medieval sage Rashi accuses Abram of stealing from Sarai here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How? After he heard Hagar disgrace Sarah, he was silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you prayed to God, “What will You give me, since I am going childless?” you prayed only for yourself, whereas you should have prayed for both of us, and I would have been remembered with you. Moreover, you are stealing from me your [protective] words, for you hear my degradation, and you remain silent (i.e., you are depriving me of the words you should have spoken to Hagar to reprimand her on my behalf)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pliskin says, “if failure to defend another person’s honor is stealing, then we are obligated to speak up when we see someone being disgraced. Word of defense are due to a person being disgraced, and it is consideres stealing to withhold them.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philippians 2:3-4 Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. [4] Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-167-8&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:7-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur. And he said, “Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?” She said, “I am fleeing from my mistress Sarai.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first mention of “The angel of the LORD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, the word for a supernatural angel is the same for a natural human messenger, but we can safely assume the Messenger of the Lord is definitely supernatural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some speculate that the angel of the LORD is pre-incarnate Jesus. There are places where this could be the case, but others where it doesn’t seem to fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the messenger is an authorized representative of the LORD, he can use the first person “I.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The messenger is at the same time distinct and not distinct from the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a government ambassador representing his king, or a corporal reading a message from a general, the messenger’s words carry the same weight as if they came from the LORD Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the lines become so blurry that it would appear that God Himself and not His angel is speaking. We’ll see this in Chapter 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Angel reinforces Hagar’s subordinate position with respect to Sarai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hagar answers the first question but cannot answer the second. She’s headed back to Egypt (the way to Shur tells us this), but spiritually she doesn’t know where she’s going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her chances of making it alone and pregnant (i.e. she would be viewed as a woman with suspect morals) probably weren’t good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s curious that God intervenes to prevent her from leaving the promised land, yet He did not do that – but could have – when Abram went to Egypt. This is God’s sovereign choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-169-11&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:9-11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angel of the LORD said to her, “Return to your mistress and submit to her.” The angel of the LORD also said to her, “I will surely multiply your offspring so that they cannot be numbered for multitude.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the angel of the LORD said to her, “Behold, you are pregnant and shall bear a son. You shall call his name Ishmael, because the LORD has listened to your affliction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yishma = he will hear, or he hears + El = God hears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone who has read Moby Dick will recall the iconic opening line “Call me Ishmael,” suggesting the narrator’s wild wandering and affliction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael is indeed a great multitude today; he is the Arabic people, many of whom were the first gentile believers in Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arabic Christians in the middle east are among the most persecuted today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jews don’t like them because they’re Arabs, and Muslims don’t like them because they’re Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Return and submit” is a tough assignment, given what Hagar has just experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1612&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He shall be a wild donkey of a man, his hand against everyone and everyone&amp;rsquo;s hand against him, and he shall dwell over against all his kinsmen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, a very dark prophecy for the Ishmaelites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Arabic (which became Islamic) tradition, Ishmael is regarded as the forefather of the Arab people and the rightful heir of Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael founded the holy city of Mecca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham nearly offered Ishmael, not Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lines of Ishmael and Isaac’s son Esau become comingled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he consolidated power, Muhammed is said to have eliminated many of his kinsman and today, Muhammed’s historical legacy is that the Suni’s hand is against the Shi’ia and vice versa. The main disagreement is over which group is the purer followers of Muhammed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is interesting is prior to the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, Jews and Muslims relations were not all that bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jews existed relatively comfortably in Islamic countries, including in the Ottoman empire. Egypt and Iran traditionally had thriving Jewish populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Israel/Palestine, Muslims generally venerated and protected Jewish holy sites such as tombs of the prophets and patriarchs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the Christian nations who were traditionally awful to the Jews with the inquisition, the pogroms, and of course the Holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After WWI, Britain and France began to muck around and redraw maps, and Jews began moving back into the Holy Land; that’s when Arab-Israeli conflicts began in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we need to be careful - this verse has been used to disparage all Arabs and Muslims. That’s called racism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our sin nature, ALL of our hands are against each other. We are only changed by the gift of a changed heart that comes through faith in Messiah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jer 17:9 “The heart is more deceitful than all else And is desperately sick; Who can understand it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen 6:5 Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of mankind was great on the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of their hearts was only evil continually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have disagreements with Islam, sure. Islam has many disagreements with Christianity (outside of the Dome of the Rock). Muslims, however are made in God’s image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1613-14&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:13-14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, “You are a God of seeing,” for she said, “Truly here I have seen him who looks after me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; it lies between Kadesh and Bered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hagar is likely stunned that she would merit such supernatural favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Roi (“row-ee” not “roy”) is God who Sees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrator uses God’s Covenant Name, but Hagar does not. Neither she nor the Ishmaelites are a party to God’s covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area is in the Negev in the wilderness. Moses and the Israelites likely passed the area on the way to Kadesh Barnea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1615-16&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:15-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;galatians-connection&#34;&gt;Galatians connection:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and one by a free woman. But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, while the son of the free woman was born through promise. Now this may be interpreted allegorically: these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar. Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children. But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother. For it is written, “Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear; break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor! For the children of the desolate one will be more than those of the one who has a husband.” Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise. But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now. But what does the Scripture say? “Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.” So, brothers, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman. Galatians 4:22-31&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Peter 3:15-16 And count the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him, as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul has a lot to say about being under the law in Galatians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter writes that people twist Paul “to their own destruction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this includes some commentators today who say Paul came to replace Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul himself identified as a Torah-observant Jew AFTER his Damascus Road experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Acts 21, people report that Paul is teaching others to forsake the law of Moses – these are FALSE accusations of Paul’s accusers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 21:39 and 22:3, “I AM a Jew (not “was”). 23:6: “I AM a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees” (not “was”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 23:9 – Pharisees pronounce Paul innocent – would they have done this if Paul had renounced Judaism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if teachers today teach that Paul forsook the Torah and renounced Judaism, is that teaching true or false?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue Paul is addressing in Galatians is the same issue many Christians struggle with: the grace of God seems too good to be true, so we feel we must somehow bring something to the table to justify ourselves. We call this “works-righteousness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the Israelites were freed from slavery and THEN they were given the Torah. We come to Jesus first, and then our lives, including our behavior and obedience, are transformed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Works-righteousness was and is a perversion of God’s gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of waiting for God’s promises Paul argues that typologically Abraham and Hagar represent works-righteousness, i.e. slavery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;misslers-conclusion&#34;&gt;Missler’s conclusion:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s servants are to trust His Word and to wait for its fulfillment, enduring patiently till the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes increasingly clear in Genesis that any person or any nation that owes its existence to divine election should live by faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human efforts will not help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the good news for God’s people is that the living God sees and hears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dont-sire-any-ishmaels&#34;&gt;Don’t sire any Ishmaels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one time about 25 years ago when email was still relatively new. While discussing something else, I happened to vent to my boss about someone in another department. I could have been less direct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the email chain got forwarded up to my Senior VP, who forwarded it to his Senior VP counterpart in the other department, and it got back to the person I said the not-nice things about. Of course I had no idea this had happened until…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weeks later, that person showed up in my office one day – mind you we didn’t work in the same building. He sought me out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was definitely a “wanna get away moment.” I did the whole “that’s not who I am or who I want to be” apology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was telling my then-pastor about it; he smiled he said, “Yep. When you typed the email, you sired an Ishmael.” At first, I said, “that’s not funny.” And then I said, “That’s a great phrase.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we act in the flesh instead of the Spirit we sire an Ishmael, a wild ass that is virtually uncontrollable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our greatest risk is our tongues – it’s why the Bible spends so much time trying to warn us about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish thought hits the topic hard – they call it “lashon hara” – the evil tongue and they associate biblical leprosy with Lashon hara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read The Passage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 7:1-17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the land, on the sea or on any tree. I saw another angel coming up from the east with a seal from the living God, and he shouted to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea, &amp;ldquo;Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads!&amp;rdquo; I heard how many were sealed—144,000 from every tribe of the people of Isra&amp;rsquo;el: From the tribe of Y&amp;rsquo;hudah 12,000 were sealed, from the tribe of Re&amp;rsquo;uven 12,000, from the tribe of Gad 12,000, from the tribe of Asher 12,000, from the tribe of Naftali 12,000, from the tribe of M&amp;rsquo;nasheh 12,000, from the tribe of Shim`on 12,000, from the tribe of Levi 12,000, from the tribe of Yissakhar 12,000, from the tribe of Z&amp;rsquo;vulun 12,000, from the tribe of Yosef 12,000, from the tribe of Binyamin 12,000. After this, I looked; and there before me was a huge crowd, too large for anyone to count, from every nation, tribe, people and language. They were standing in front of the throne and in front of the Lamb, dressed in white robes and holding palm branches in their hands; and they shouted, &amp;ldquo;Victory to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!&amp;rdquo; All the angels stood around the throne, the elders and the four living beings; they fell face down before the throne and worshipped God, saying, &amp;ldquo;Amen! &amp;ldquo;Praise and glory, wisdom and thanks, honor and power and strength belong to our God forever and ever! &amp;ldquo;Amen!&amp;rdquo; One of the elders asked me, &amp;ldquo;These people dressed in white robes—who are they, and where are they from?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Sir,&amp;rdquo; I answered, &amp;ldquo;you know.&amp;rdquo; Then he told me, &amp;ldquo;These are the people who have come out of the Great Persecution. They have washed their robes and made them white with the blood of the Lamb. That is why they are before God&amp;rsquo;s throne. &amp;ldquo;Day and night they serve him in his Temple; and the One who sits on the throne will put his Sh&amp;rsquo;khinah upon them. &amp;ldquo;They will never again be hungry, they will never again be thirsty, the sun will not beat down on them, nor will any burning heat. &amp;ldquo;For the Lamb at the center of the throne will shepherd them, will lead them to springs of living water, and God will wipe every tear from their eyes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-71&#34;&gt;Rev 7:1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;After this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the land, on the sea or on any tree.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;After this,&amp;rdquo; could mean that this &lt;em&gt;vision&lt;/em&gt; came after the previous one; not necessarily that the &lt;em&gt;events&lt;/em&gt; in chapter 7 necessarily follow those in Chapter 6.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keener sees 6:12-17 as representing the end of the age, so chapter 7 with the sealing of the faithful must occur beforehand.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seven seals/trumpets/bowls could be different visions describing the same things; not necessarily 21 different events in sequence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Four corners is clearly symbolic – no one in that day believed the earth was square. Here it represents the four directions on the compass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The four winds/horsemen/angels are apparently connected:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Zec 6:1-8 Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains. And the mountains were mountains of bronze. (2) The first chariot had red horses, the second black horses, (3) the third white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses—all of them strong. (4) Then I answered and said to the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” (5**) And the angel answered and said to me, “These are going out to the four winds of heaven, after presenting themselves before the Lord of all the ear**th. (6) The chariot with the black horses goes toward the north country, the white ones go after them, and the dappled ones go toward the south country.” (7) When the strong horses came out, they were impatient to go and patrol the earth. And he said, “Go, patrol the earth.” So they patrolled the earth. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-72-3&#34;&gt;Rev 7:2-3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;I saw another angel coming up from the east with a seal from the living God, and he shouted to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea, &amp;ldquo;Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads!&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This seal is God&amp;rsquo;s signet ring; i.e., His stamp of authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From Rev 14:1, we know that the seal was the name of the Lamb and of his Father. &lt;small&gt;Rev 14:1 Then I looked, and behold, on Mount Zion stood the Lamb, and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father&amp;rsquo;s name written on their foreheads. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a challnge to interpret since we believe there are more than 144,000 servants of God. See discussion at Rev 7:4-8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, we know from the 5th seal that there are many martyrs so we cannot say that the 144,000 is a global seal of protection for all believers; it keeps the people sealed from God&amp;rsquo;s wrath but not wrath in general.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This recalls the preparations for the Exodus and the application of the lamb&amp;rsquo;s blood to the doorpost prior to the final plague of the death of the firstborn
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Exo 12:12-13 For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the LORD. The blood shall be a sign for you, on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague will befall you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seal on the foreheads recalls Exodus, Deuteronomy, and Ezekiel:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Exo 13:9 And it shall be to you as a sign on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes, that the law of the LORD may be in your mouth. For with a strong hand the LORD has brought you out of Egypt.***&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are to be sealed by the Word of God: &lt;small&gt;Deu 6:6-8 And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. 7 You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. 8 You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Eze 9:4-6 And the LORD said to him, “Pass through the city, through Jerusalem, and &lt;strong&gt;put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and groan over all the abominations&lt;/strong&gt; that are committed in it.” 5 And to the others he said in my hearing, “Pass through the city after him, and strike. Your eye shall not spare, and you shall show no pity. Kill old men outright, young men and maidens, little children and women, but &lt;strong&gt;touch no one on whom is the mark&lt;/strong&gt;. And begin at my sanctuary.” So they began with the elders who were before the house. &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This mark is for those who oppose the abominations done in Jerusalem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Ezekiel, the word for &amp;ldquo;mark&amp;rdquo; is the Hebrew letter Tav. ת,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Ezekiel&amp;rsquo;s day it would have looked like an x.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It bears some similarity to a cross but it is unlikely a Cross, the way we might think of it, was in view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Rev 9:3-4 Then from the smoke came locusts on the earth, and they were given power like the power of scorpions of the earth. 4 They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any green plant or any tree, but only those people &lt;strong&gt;who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This stands in obvious contrast with the mark of the beast
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Rev 13:15-17 And it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast might even speak and might cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be slain. 16 Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, 17 so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-74-8&#34;&gt;Rev 7:4-8&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I heard how many were sealed—144,000 from every tribe of the people of Isra&amp;rsquo;el: From the tribe of Y&amp;rsquo;hudah 12,000 were sealed, from the tribe of Re&amp;rsquo;uven 12,000, from the tribe of Gad 12,000, from the tribe of Asher 12,000, from the tribe of Naftali 12,000, from the tribe of M&amp;rsquo;nasheh 12,000, from the tribe of Shim`on 12,000, from the tribe of Levi 12,000, from the tribe of Yissakhar 12,000, from the tribe of Z&amp;rsquo;vulun 12,000, from the tribe of Yosef 12,000, from the tribe of Binyamin 12,000.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We either must read the 144,000 as consistently literally or consistently symbolically.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either it&amp;rsquo;s literally 12,000 male Jewish virgins – or specifically, those who have not ritually defiled themselves in any fashion (per Rev 14:4) from each of the 12 listed tribes, or it&amp;rsquo;s all the spiritual servants of God (Rev 7:3, 9), but not literally 144,000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying there are literally 144,000 sealed, but not literally Jews who are sealed is an incoherent argument. If someone claims to be a member of the 144,000, a scriptural response is to ask which tribe they are from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As Revelation fits squarely within the genre of Jewish apocalyptic literature, perhaps we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so quick to allegorize this, despite the apparent relatively small number of those who are sealed.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we are to allegorize, why is the list of 12 tribes enumerated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why does this exact number of 144,000 reappear in Rev 14?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster sees the 144,000 as is a portion of the whole amount of Israel, specifically an army as we see in 1st Samuel.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;1 Samuel 21:3-5 Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever is here.” 4 And the priest answered David, “I have no common bread on hand, but there is holy bread—if the young men have kept themselves from women.” 5 And David answered the priest, “Truly women have been kept from us as always when I go on an expedition. The vessels of the young men are holy even when it is an ordinary journey. How much more today will their vessels be holy?”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;have not defiled themselves with women&amp;rdquo; is an idiom for complete Levitical ritual purity.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the army of Israel went out to war, they had to be in a state of ritual purity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is because the Lord was in their midst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore the implication of the 144,000 is that this is an army of the Lord, the fighting men of the son of King David.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usually, when there is a census in the Bible, it is to determine the number of fighting men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only the men are numbered.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Numbers 31:2-5 “Avenge the people of Israel on the Midianites. Afterward you shall be gathered to your people.” 3 So Moses spoke to the people, saying, “Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian to execute the LORD&amp;rsquo;s vengeance on Midian. 4 You shall send a thousand from each of the tribes of Israel to the war.” 5 So there were provided, out of the thousands of Israel, &lt;strong&gt;a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand armed for war&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Num 31:48-49 Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, came near to Moses 49 and said to Moses, “Your servants have counted the men of war who are under our command, &lt;strong&gt;and there is not a man missing from us&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So there&amp;rsquo;s a miracle in that they all survived the battle, just as the 144,000 will be sealed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The context of Numbers 31 is the preservation of Israel, which should be viewed as the theme of Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Revelation, we see a mathematical amplification.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peter asked, &amp;ldquo;should I forgive seven times,&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered &amp;ldquo;70 times seven&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the same way we can say of Revelation 7, &amp;ldquo;not 12,000 as against the Midianites, but 12 times 12,000.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster quoted an 18th-century Messianic Jew who believes the 144,000 faithful represent a first-fruits offering.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fact, we are told in Revelation 14:4 &lt;small&gt;It is these (144,000) who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins. It is these who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. &lt;strong&gt;These have been redeemed from mankind as firstfruits for God and the Lamb&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A first fruits offering is 1/50th of the total harvest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This small portion is said to sanctify the whole&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul mentions this in Romans 11, which is the chapter on the ultimate sanctification of Israel:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Rom 11:16, 26: If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches… And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, “The Deliverer will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob”; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to this approach, when the 144,000 are sealed and Messiah is revealed, this will lead to faith of all Israel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The relatively modern Messianic Jewish movement may be FAR MORE significant than anyone realizes. These 144,000 are, by definition, Messianic Jews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God who will be doing the selection knows who is from which tribe, even though we may not see evidence of the 12 tribes today.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On that note, remember the legend of the &amp;ldquo;10 lost tribes&amp;rdquo; is just that. There is no scriptural basis.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James addressed his letter to the &amp;ldquo;12 tribes&amp;rdquo; in the diaspora.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the northern kingdom was furthering their journey into idolatry, we know the faithful migrated to Judah (2 Chr 15:9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In acts 2 there are separate references to the men of Judah (Acts 2:14) and the men of Israel (Acts 2:22, 36).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the days of the apostles, the 10 tribes were considered absent, not missing or lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the way, if you know anyone named Cone, Cohen, Levin, Lewis, or perhaps Lewinsky and Epstein, they might be descended from the tribe of Levi, though certainly many people with these names do not act with the holiness required of a Levitical priest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missler and many other pre-trib commentators would see the 144,000 as the preservation of the Jewish people &lt;strong&gt;through&lt;/strong&gt; the Tribulation, whereas the church is &lt;strong&gt;kept from&lt;/strong&gt; the Tribulation.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything on earth pertains to Jews, while everything in Heaven pertains to the church.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As messianic commentators point out, this position gets difficult to defend from scripture once one starts peeling back the layers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ultimately it is an assumption that the &amp;ldquo;rapture&amp;rdquo; occurs between chapters 3 and 4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we assume a pre-trib rapture, are we saying that Messianic Jews will NOT be raptured because they are Jewish? That&amp;rsquo;s nonsensical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not picking a side here – we encourage everyone to do their Acts 17:11 homework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-list-of-the-12-tribes&#34;&gt;The list of the 12 tribes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to miss that, overall, there are actually 13 tribes from which to compose the various lists of the 12 tribes that occur in the Bible. Why is this? Joseph received a double-portion in Ephraim and Manasseh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When listing the 12 tribes and we want to include Levi, Joseph is just Joseph: Reuben, Simeon, &lt;strong&gt;Levi&lt;/strong&gt;, Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, &lt;strong&gt;Joseph&lt;/strong&gt;, and Benjamin.
o-   In certain lists, the priestly tribe of Levi is excluded. Yet the list still contains 12 tribes because Joseph is split into Ephraim and Manasseh: Reuben, Simeon, Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Manasseh, Ephraim, and Benjamin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where is Dan?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that we aren&amp;rsquo;t told anywhere why Dan is omitted, but the usual explanation is that Dan is generally associated with idolatry and apostasy
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewish Sages explained that the north was the literal dark side (since in the Northern Hemisphere, the Sun can be east, west, or south, but never north).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dan was positioned on the north side of the camp of Israel because &amp;ldquo;Dan darkened the world by idolatry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This may underlie a warning that even among God&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;chosen&amp;rdquo; people (whether it&amp;rsquo;s the Jewish people or we, who have been chosen by Jesus), there is a danger of these things creeping in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Joh 6:70 Jesus answered them, “Did I not choose you, the twelve? And yet one of you is a devil.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iraneus claims to be quoting Jewish apocalyptic literature which says the anti-messiah will come from Dan.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no biblical evidence to support, but since Iraneus was a disciple of Polycarp, who was a disciple of John himself, perhaps this tradition also shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be quickly dismissed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listing Manasseh and Joseph is odd. Manasseh was a part of Joseph. While the Bible is fundamentally inerrant in its original transmissions, we do know that there are a few scribal errors
-   &lt;small&gt;John 5:3b-4 is a well-known example; it is omitted from most modern translations.&lt;/small&gt;
-   Some suggest that naming Manasseh instead of Dan was such an error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ephraim is indirectly referenced, likely because they were also associated with Jeroboam&amp;rsquo;s Idolatry (Hos 4:17)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeroboam set up two pagan altars: one was in the land of Ephraim and the other was in Dan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archaeologists have excavated what they believe are the remains of the alter at Tel Dan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-79&#34;&gt;Rev 7:9&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After this, I looked; and there before me was a huge crowd, too large for anyone to count, from every nation, tribe, people and language. They were standing in front of the throne and in front of the Lamb, dressed in white robes and holding palm branches in their hands&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is possible that this huge crowd is another picture of those who were sealed now in heaven, or a different group.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An example of the former is found in Genesis 41, where Pharoah had two different visions of the same famine event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We saw a great multitude in Rev 5:9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again we see the white robes we saw the martyrs wearing in chapter 6 – may or may not be the same group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is the same group, it is now &amp;ldquo;a little while longer&amp;rdquo; (Rev 6:11)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Palm branches reminiscent of Palm Sunday and the Feast of Tabernacles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-710-12&#34;&gt;Rev 7:10-12&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and they shouted, &amp;ldquo;Victory to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!&amp;rdquo; All the angels stood around the throne, the elders and the four living beings; they fell face down before the throne and worshipped God, saying, &amp;ldquo;Amen! &amp;ldquo;Praise and glory, wisdom and thanks, honor and power and strength belong to our God forever and ever! &amp;ldquo;Amen!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Greek, the word for &amp;ldquo;victory&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;soteeria&amp;rdquo;, literally &amp;ldquo;salvation&amp;rdquo;; but &amp;ldquo;Salvation to our God&amp;rdquo; is awkward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salvation FROM our God makes more sense - &lt;small&gt;Psa 98:2 The LORD has made known his salvation; he has revealed his righteousness in the sight of the nations. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Hebrew, the word would be Yeshua, the Hebrew name for Jesus.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;הִנֵּה אֵל &lt;strong&gt;יְשׁוּעָתִי&lt;/strong&gt;, אֶבְטַח וְלֹא אֶפְחָד, כִּי עָזִּי וְזִמְרָת יָהּ יְיָ, וַיְהִי לִי &lt;strong&gt;לִישׁוּעָה&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Behold, God is my salvation, I will trust God and not be afraid, for my strong faith and song of praise for God will be my salvation.&amp;rdquo; Jewish folk song&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-713&#34;&gt;Rev 7:13&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the elders asked me, &amp;ldquo;These people dressed in white robes—who are they, and where are they from?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Sir,&amp;rdquo; I answered, &amp;ldquo;you know.&amp;rdquo; Then he told me, &amp;ldquo;These are the people who have come out of the Great Persecution. They have washed their robes and made them white with the blood of the Lamb&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking a question a student wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know was a common rabbinical technique.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Eze 37:3 And he said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” And I answered, “O Lord GOD, you know.” &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great Persecution/Tribulation refers to Daniel
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Dan 12:1 “At that time shall arise Michael, the great prince who has charge of your people. And there shall be a time of trouble, such as never has been since there was a nation till that time. But at that time your people shall be delivered, everyone whose name shall be found written in the book. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This time, there IS a definite article in Greek. This is THE great tribulation, the mega pressure, literally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we mentioned at the beginning of the study, these words are intended to offer comfort to those 1st century believers undergoing persecution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Made white with blood&amp;rdquo; is an obvious contradiction.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A blood stain is notoriously difficult to remove, and a figurative bloodstain moreso than a literal one (as Shakespeare referenced in Macbeth)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are made pure by His blood and our being faithful to His commands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are clearly martyrs, perhaps we can use the term &amp;ldquo;Tribulation Saints.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-715-17&#34;&gt;Rev 7:15-17&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That is why they are before God&amp;rsquo;s throne. &amp;ldquo;Day and night they serve him in his Temple; and the One who sits on the throne will put his Sh&amp;rsquo;khinah upon them. &amp;ldquo;They will never again be hungry, they will never again be thirsty, the sun will not beat down on them, nor will any burning heat. &amp;ldquo;For the Lamb at the center of the throne will shepherd them, will lead them to springs of living water, and God will wipe every tear from their eyes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The heavenly throne is again described as a temple (Rev 4:6), and continues the theme of Jesus the great High Priest serving in the Heavenly temple (Hebrews 8)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shekinah = protection and provision
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He spreads his covering over us, which is a theme that runs through scripture as the Shekinah inhabited the Tent of Meeting.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The two words are linguistically related in Hebrew:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shekinah = dwelling; God&amp;rsquo;s glory dwelling with mankind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mishkan – tent, tabernacle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Heb 1:3-4 He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, 4 having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Eze 37:27 My dwelling place shall be with them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Rth 3:9-11 He said, “Who are you?” And she answered, “I am Ruth, your servant. Spread your wings over your servant, for you are a redeemer.” 10 And he said, “May you be blessed by the LORD, my daughter. You have made this last kindness greater than the first in that you have not gone after young men, whether poor or rich. 11 And now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you all that you ask, for all my fellow townsmen know that you are a worthy woman.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Isa 4:5-6 Then the LORD will create over the whole site of Mount Zion and over her assemblies a cloud by day, and smoke and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory there will be a canopy. There will be a booth for shade by day from the heat, and for a refuge and a shelter from the storm and rain. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Isa 25:8 He will swallow up death forever; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from all faces, and the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for the LORD has spoken. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Isa 49:10 they shall not hunger or thirst, neither scorching wind nor sun shall strike them, for he who has pity on them will lead them, and by springs of water will guide them. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Joh 10:11 I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The culmination of wiping every tear and springs of living water will be in Revelation 21:4,6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pause-to-review&#34;&gt;Pause to Review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this gap between the 6th and 7th seal, this is a good spot to recap
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We began with the apocalypse, the revelation, the unveiling of Jesus Christ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John was imprisoned on Patmos during the Domitian persecution.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domitian considered Jews tax evaders, though they were legally exempted, but he considered gentile believers in Jesus traitors for disavowing the Roman gods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation is entirely consistent with extra-biblical Jewish apocalyptic literature: Although terrible things are happening to God&amp;rsquo;s people, God is not absent. For the wicked, a day of judgment; for the righteous a day of rewards is yet to come&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an order of transmission: God to Jesus, to His Angel, to John, to the seven assemblies.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are reading it indirectly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The letter is written for us but not to us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nonetheless, there is a blessing for ANYONE who reads, hears, AND KEEPS the words (Rev 1:3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before John gets into the crazy stuff he saw, he sends specific messages to the seven assemblies.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I see your deeds&amp;rdquo;; five of the churches were told to repent!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A promise to the overcomer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chapter 4 – after this a door was open in heaven
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster sees Rosh Hashana imagery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah and Ezekiel saw similar views as John with the Ancient of Days on His throne&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John sees the Seraphim from Isaiah (John saw seven torches) representing what is above and we see the four living creatures from Ezekiel representing the earthly realm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chapter 5 opened with the Ancient of Days with a scroll in His hand with seven seals
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a moment of drama as no one, seemingly is found to open the scroll, until the One like a Son of Man, the same One Daniel saw in chapter 7 presents Himself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is both the Lion of the Tribe of Judah and He is the Lamb standing as though it had been slain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every creature in heaven, on earth, and under the earth and in the sea and all that is in them praised, &amp;ldquo;to him who sits on the throne and to the lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever. Amen!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chapter 6 has Lamb opening the first six seals
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first seal is white horse of conquest, perhaps by deception and likely without armed conflict&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second seal is the red horse of armed conquest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third seal is the black horse of famine and inflation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fourth seal is the pale horse of death&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fifth seal is not a judgment poured on earth, but it is the blood of the martyrs poured on the alter. They cried for God&amp;rsquo;s justice but were told to wait a little while longer. This little while for us, has been lasting for 1900 years since John first saw the vision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sixth seal brings great calamity, the wrath of the Lamb, the Day of the Lord.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under the sixth seal we will have the remaining judgments in Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s reasonable to ask, &amp;ldquo;who on Earth will be able to survive this? How is God going to fulfill His promises He made to Israel?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The answer comes in Chapter 7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chapter 7 sees an angel putting a seal on 144,000 Jews which assures that they will survive to the end and will be able to usher in the Messianic Era
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had to peek ahead to Revelation 14 to get the answer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Rev 14:1-5 Then I looked, and behold, on Mount Zion stood the Lamb, and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father&amp;rsquo;s name written on their foreheads. 2 And I heard a voice from heaven like the roar of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder. The voice I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps, 3 and they were singing a &lt;strong&gt;new song&lt;/strong&gt; before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders. No one could learn that song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth. 4 It is these who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins. It is these who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These have been redeemed from mankind as &lt;strong&gt;firstfruits&lt;/strong&gt; for God and the Lamb, 5 and in their mouth no lie was found, for they are blameless.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John then has a vision in 7:9 back to heaven where he sees a multitude of what we might call Tribulation Saints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next time we will be in Chapter 8 and the seventh seal, which ushers in the seven trumpets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No specific geographic information is provided, but it’s reasonable to believe the meeting took place at the same site as one of their prior meetings. Therefore Beer Sheba is a good guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Genesis 17, God reaffirms His promise to Abraham, whose name God has recently changed. Abraham means “father of multitudes,” which at this point has to be considered a prophecy. As a sign of the covenant, God institutes circumcision. Sarai’s name is changed to Sarah, meaning “Princess.” God reiterates that Sarah will have a child in her old age. Abraham laughs, and God says the son’s name shall be Laughter “Yitzhak.” Abraham then circumcises himself, his son Ishmael, and the rest of his household (who probably weren’t laughing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-171-2-abraham-is-99-when-lord-appears-again&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:1-2: Abraham is 99 when LORD appears again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Now when Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, “I am God Almighty; Walk before Me, and be blameless. “I will make My covenant between Me and you, And I will multiply you exceedingly” (New American Standard Version).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first mention of God Almighty = El Shaddai&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Used 48x in OT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t exactly sure what “shaddai” means, but it has the sense of supplier, strength, protector, guardian, and sufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mezuzot and tefillin (phylacteries) have the Hebrew &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;שׁ&lt;/span&gt; for Shaddai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster: “He is sufficient to meet our needs. He is sufficient to carry us and sustain us, even through the long, dry spells when we do not necessarily feel His presence.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen years have passed between Genesis 16 and 17 and twenty-four years since Genesis 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, Abraham assumed Ishmael was the promised son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster sees a separate covenant from Genesis 15, one that “reaffirms all the same promises but increases their scope.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most other commentators would agree that the scope is increased but it’s the same covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster sees the following distinctions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Gen 15&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Gen 17&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Unconditional, Abram was asleep&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Abraham must live out his life with integrity and walk with God, submitting to His Authority.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A great nation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A multitude of nations (4)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Abundant seed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Kings come forth (6)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Land is a possession.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Canaan is an everlasting possession (8)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Name and mother of son not stated – Abraham assumed Ishmael&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sarah will have a son to be named Isaac (16, 20-21)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be hyperanalyzing the two covenants, but it’s interesting (I have three of his commentaries, and he only mentioned this in the oldest one; it’s entirely possible he’s since backed off of this viewpoint).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to walk before God and be blameless?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster writes, “Messianic Paul Leavertoff said, “If you want to know God, you must first have the certainty that He knows and loves you.” That’s the basis for a friendship, such as Abraham experienced with God.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-173-4-father-of-multitudes&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:3-4: Father of multitudes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying, “As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, And you will be the father of a multitude of nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A minor point perhaps, but it doesn’t say “our covenant” it says “My covenant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster’s view notwithstanding, it could be God is reiterating that the covenant is unilateral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is in response to chapter 16, where we might say Abraham tried to meet the terms of God’s covenant in Abraham&amp;rsquo;s own power apart from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton notes “no parallels in the ancient world to covenants between diety and mortal. Gods make demands and promise favor…but these fall far short of a covenant relationship initiated by diety for His own purposes.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-175-6-abram-to-abraham&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:5-6: Abram to Abraham&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No longer shall you be named Abram, But your name shall be Abraham; For I have made you the father of a multitude of nations. “I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham = father of multitudes. For a moment this must have seemed like a cruel joke. He was 99. Imagine the snickering when he told his men his new name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, the King of Kings will come from Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 1:1: The record of the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned, Romans 4 is Paul’s exposition on Genesis 15:6, “Abraham believed and it was credited to him as righteousness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul makes a reference to Genesis 17:5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 4:17-18 (as it is written: “I HAVE MADE YOU A FATHER OF MANY NATIONS”) in the presence of Him whom he believed, that is, God, who gives life to the dead and calls into being things that do not exist. [18] In hope against hope he believed, so that he might become a father of many nations according to that which had been spoken, “SO SHALL YOUR DESCENDANTS BE.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Abram to Abraham and Sarai to Sarah have the Hebrew letter &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ה&lt;/span&gt; added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some see the breath of God’s spirit as when God breathed life into Adam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word for love is pronounced ahav (&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אהב&lt;/span&gt;), which is adding a &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ה&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אב&lt;/span&gt;, the word for “father.” The &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ה&lt;/span&gt; thus represents love as the essence of the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, as with Adam, that which you name you have dominion over – God is establishing a special relationship with this couple by naming them personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God renamed Abram. God named Isaac prior to conception. God renamed Jacob as Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-177-8-you-and-your-descendants&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:7-8: you and your descendants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations as an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your descendants after you. “And I will give to you and to your descendants after you the land where you live as a stranger, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is the primary beneficiary of the covenant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary concluded her beautiful &lt;em&gt;Magnificat&lt;/em&gt; in Luke 1 with a reference to Genesis 17:7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Mary said: “My soul exalts the Lord, And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior. “For He has had regard for the humble state of His bond-servant; For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed. “For the Mighty One has done great things for me; And holy is His name. “And His mercy is to generation after generation Toward those who fear Him. “He has done mighty deeds with His arm; He has scattered those who were proud in the thoughts of their hearts. “He has brought down rulers from their thrones, And has exalted those who were humble. “He has filled the hungry with good things, And sent the rich away empty-handed. “He has given help to His servant Israel, In remembrance of His mercy, Just as He spoke to our fathers, To Abraham and his descendants forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zechariah similarly invoked Abraham in the famous &lt;em&gt;Benedictus&lt;/em&gt; Luke 1:68-75:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, For He has visited us and accomplished redemption for His people, And has raised up a horn of salvation for us In the house of His servant David— Just as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from ancient times— Salvation from our enemies, And from the hand of all who hate us; To show mercy to our fathers, And to remember His holy covenant, The oath which He swore to our father Abraham, To grant us that we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies, Would serve Him without fear, In holiness and righteousness before Him all our days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-179-11-circumcision&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:9-11: Circumcision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 God said further to Abraham, “Now as for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations. “This is My covenant, which you shall keep, between Me and you and your descendants after you: every male among you shall be circumcised. “And you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be the sign of the covenant between Me and you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s covenants are always associated with a sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah – rainbow; Abraham-circumcision; Moses-the Sabbath; David-a House (both in terms of a building and a royal bloodline); Jesus/New Covenant-Bread and Wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this covenant dealt with progeny and legacy, God selected the relevant part of the body for the covenant’s sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intent is that every time a son of Abraham engages in reproduction, they would be reminded not only of the covenant with Abraham but the individual’s role both as beneficiary and trustee in the covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circumcision was fairly common in the ancient near east, though as we shall see, over time it becomes associated with Abraham’s children and not the larger gentile world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton: “Circumcision can be seen as one of many cases where God transforms a common practice to a new purpose in revealing Himself and relating to his people.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Paul’s major points is that Genesis 15:6 comes before 17:10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, belief/faith comes first, followed by Obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 4:10-12: How then was (Abraham’s faith) credited? While he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? Not while circumcised, but while uncircumcised; and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while uncircumcised, so that he might be the father of all who believe without being circumcised, that righteousness might be credited to them, and the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also follow in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had while uncircumcised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1712-13-the-8supthsup-day&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:12-13: the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 “And every male among you who is eight days old shall be circumcised throughout your generations, including a slave who is born in the house or who is bought with money from any foreigner, who is not of your descendants. “A slave who is born in your house or who is bought with your money shall certainly be circumcised; so My covenant shall be in your flesh as an everlasting covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler suggests that the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day is when Vitamin K and Prothrombin peak in the body at 110% of normal before stabilizing at normal levels, helping with healing and pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Christianity, we say that baptism is supposed to be an outward sign of an inward change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circumcision is sort of like this, though, for Jews at 8 days old, it is certainly it’s an outward sign of what is expected to be an inward change. The stock market might call it a forward-looking statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presumably, when the age of accountability is reached the boy would realize he’s under the covenant and act accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either case, the act is a sign of the covenant; in other words, it points to the covenant, it is not the covenant itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting circumcised doesn’t make one Jewish any more than getting baptized makes one a Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism doesn’t make you a Christian; you’re a Christian; therefore, you get baptized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Moses, Jeremiah, and Paul will dig into the theme of “circumcision of the heart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteronomy 30:6 “Moreover, the LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the hearts of your descendants, to love the LORD your God with all your heart and all your soul, so that you may live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah 9:26 Egypt, Judah, Edom, the sons of Ammon, Moab, and all those inhabiting the desert who trim the hair on their temples; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised of heart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 2:28-29 For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh. [29] But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter; and his praise is not from people, but from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circumcision of the Flesh reminds Jews that they’re under a unique covenant that requires circumcision of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water Baptism reminds a Christian that we’re under a unique covenant that requires Baptism of the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not that far apart – our procedure is less painful but their procedure probably better assures converts are committed to their new faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that “circumcision of the heart” does not replace physical circumcision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read verse 13 again. (Physical) circumcision is an “EVERLASTING” covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the various “sabbath controversies” in the Gospels, Jesus demonstrates that the things that He was doing were not violations of Shabbat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Jewish Messiah could not have violated the Sabbath and still claim to be the Jewish Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Sabbath act was related to bettering the human condition and alleviating suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ argument was that they were approved exceptions (even though those exceptions were not generally accepted in the Jewish community – He came to redefine/correct their view of the Sabbath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that regard, Jesus could have easily pointed to the command to circumcise on the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jewish practice, the circumcision (called a ‘bris’ in American and Europe) is performed on the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day even if the baby is born on a Friday (which presumably 14.2% of Jewish babies are).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The command is so important to furthering life (as represented by the original Covenant with Abraham) it supersedes Sabbath restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1714-uncircumcised-shall-be-cut-off&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:14: Uncircumcised shall be cut off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 “But as for an uncircumcised male, one who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that person shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One who refuses to get cut off shall be cut off (hard to miss the irony in that one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, the son of a Jewish father and a gentile mother is not Jewish and is not required to be circumcised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is different for a Jewish mother, whose male son was required to be circumcised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guideline was evidently in play in the first century as Paul had timothy circumcised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 16:1-3 Now Paul also came to Derbe and to Lystra. And a disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek … Paul wanted this man to leave with him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had ever wondered why Paul, who was typically so “anti-circumcision,” had Timothy circumcised, now you know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you got circumcised in a hospital, this was a worldly medical procedure; even though it probably has some health benefits, it is not the same as a covenant of circumcision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a previously circumcised gentile converts to Judiasm, a drop of blood from that area will be obtained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The covenant was a free gift (well, mostly free). Just as someone named in a will can refuse an inheritance, refusing to be circumcised means the person was opting out of God’s covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can a person lose his or her salvation? Probably not if the person falls away through deception or falling into some sin pattern, but is God going to force a person who once made a profession but later willfully opts out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1715-16-sarai-to-sarah&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:15-16: Sarai to Sarah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 Then God said to Abraham, “As for your wife Sarai, you shall not call her by the name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name. “I will bless her, and indeed I will give you a son by her. Then I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah means princess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Famous sons are often preceded by divine announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster tells of a Jewish fable that is curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As context, Sarai ends with the Hebrew letter yod (&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;י&lt;/span&gt;); the yod was dropped and replaced with a hei to form Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the yod was lost from the end of Sarai’s name, it soared up to heaven to protest. “Is it because I am the smallest of all the letters that You have removed me from the name of righteous Sarai?” God replied, “Previously you were the last letter in a woman’s name. I am promoting you to the first letter in a man’s name.” For Moses renamed the son of Nun Yehoshua from Hoshea (Numbers 13:16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Followers of our Messiah raise an eyebrow at this story because in the first century, the name Yeshoshua had been abbreviated to Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster concludes, “the little letter yod had no further reason to complain about the change of Sarai’s name” as it is now associated with the Messiah.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1717&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:17&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17 Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, “Will a child be born to a man a hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, give birth to a child?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham assumed his descendants would come through Ishmael, whom Abraham loved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verb for laugh is Tzhak. Yitzhak is related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also means joking, mocking, sporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Genesis 26:8 Isaac is Tzhaking with Rebekkah (translated in NASB as caressing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Genesis 21:9 the son of Hagar is Tzahaking Isaac (translated in NASB as mocking), prompting Sarah to tell Abraham to drive out the slave woman and her son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul continues in Romans 4, with a reference to Abraham’s and Sarah’s old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 4:18-22: In hope against hope he believed, so that he might become a father of many nations according to that which had been spoken, “SO SHALL YOUR DESCENDANTS BE.” Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah’s womb; yet, with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in unbelief but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully assured that what God had promised, He was able also to perform. Therefore IT WAS ALSO CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1718-19&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:18-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Abraham said to God, “Oh that Ishmael might live before You!” But God said, “No, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you shall name him Isaac; and I will establish My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abraham loved Ishmael&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1720-22&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:20-22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 “As for Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I will bless him, and make him fruitful and multiply him exceedingly. He shall father twelve princes, and I will make him into a great nation. “But I will establish My covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this season next year.” When He finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1723-27&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:23-27&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abraham took his son Ishmael, and all the slaves who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s household, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin on this very same day, as God had said to him. Now Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. And his son Ishmael was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. On this very same day Abraham was circumcised, as well as his son Ishmael. And all the men of his household, those who were born in the house or bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham’s 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; test: to undergo such a painful ritual, Abraham had to have faith in the promise which had not yet materialized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have been stressing, his faith came first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of his faith he then changed his behavior to conform to God’s standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use our terminology, He didn’t get circumcised to get righteous with God; he got circumcised because by faith, he already was righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are saved by virtue of our faith, not by our ethnicity or whether we have undergone a ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle over circumcision in the Apostolic era was heated and complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We make it about “Law versus Grace,” but that is oversimplifying the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a side that reasonably believed that one had to be Jewish to follow a Jewish messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore Gentiles who came to faith should naturally wish to convert to Judaism and undergo circumcision in keeping with the expressed wishes of God in the Abrahamic covenant we just read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul agreed the commandment should continue to be required for Jewish people who come to faith in Messiah (as we saw with Timothy)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul and others cited verses in the Old Testament that said Gentiles would believe in Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Paul’s arguments is that if you required gentiles to convert to Judism, then they would henceforth be Jews not Gentiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are no gentiles, how can the OT passages regarding gentiles following Messiah be fulfilled?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, these adult believers would now be legally Jewish and required to keep the Torah, just the same as Jews who had been raised in Jewish homes and communities. The gentile converts would be at a severe disadvantage (see Galatians 5:3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a believer in Yeshua had the desire and discipline to begin the path to conversion to Judaism, that was great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A late first-century document called the Didache appears to state that such conversion could be a reasonable path for many mature disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be wrong to require such discipline from a brand-new gentile believer; it would be setting them up to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another of Paul’s arguments is that by requiring conversion to Judaism, the gentiles would have to earn their salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gentiles who believed this were trying to earn their way into heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our faith doesn’t work like that; what’s more, the Torah doesn’t teach that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still another of Paul’s arguments hinges upon the fact that Paul found Abraham’s new name significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just a “great nation” in Genesis 12 and 15, but now a multitude of goyim, gentile nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are sons of Abraham not by bloodline but by faith in Yeshua the perfect seed of Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul was not anti-Judaism; he was against the perversion of Judaism into a works-based religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m confident he would similarly be against 21st-century examples of works-based righteousness that are present in many Christian churches today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we say, be a Berean. Don’t take my word for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try reading Galatians with this assumption about Paul and see if it doesn’t make more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster: “Yeshua of Nazareth is the ultimate fulfillment of the Abrahamic promises. He is the promised Messiah, the Son of Abraham in whom all nations will be blessed. As children of Abraham, we share in his firm hope, his faith in God, and the promised Seed of Abraham. He is the father of all who believe.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read/hear the passage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revelation 8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. And another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer, and he was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne, and the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before God from the hand of the angel. Then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth, and there were peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake. Now the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to blow them. The first angel blew his trumpet, and there followed hail and fire, mixed with blood, and these were thrown upon the earth. And a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up. The second angel blew his trumpet, and something like a great mountain, burning with fire, was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood. A third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed. The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, blazing like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many people died from the water, because it had been made bitter. The fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of their light might be darkened, and a third of the day might be kept from shining, and likewise a third of the night. Then I looked, and I heard an eagle crying with a loud voice as it flew directly overhead, “Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, at the blasts of the other trumpets that the three angels are about to blow!”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are waiting on the opening of all seven seals to open the document of reception&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seals 1-4 were the four horsemen, with their associated calamities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seal #5 were the martyrs crying out to God for justice.  They were told to wait a little longer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seal #6 unleashes the Day of the Lord with earthquake, sun going to black, the sky being rolled up, with the earth-dwellers crying out for refuge from God&amp;rsquo;s wrath.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most scholars see all six seals as yet future, but an argument may be made that the first 5 could have been opened in the first century, while the sixth is still to come.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, the first 5 represent birth pangs that increase in intensity as the time of delivery nears.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Matthew 24, Jesus says when we see the same types of things as in the first five seals, the end is &amp;ldquo;not yet.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-81&#34;&gt;Rev 8:1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silence
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God paused to hear the silent prayers of the saints, corresponding to the time of daily prayers/sacrifices at the temple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The priest in charge of the incense would be inside the temple while the people outside were praying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist was that incense priest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luk 1:21  And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in the temple.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the absence of a temple, the congregants pray in silence, as they do today in the synagogue in the Amidah prayer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dan 6:10  When Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he went to his house where he had windows in his upper chamber open toward Jerusalem. He got down on his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jerusalem was in rubble, yet Daniel still faced Jerusalem when He prayed.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An alternate conjecture is that God paused to hear the defense of Earth-dwellers who feel the sixth seal was unwarranted/unfair.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lo and behold, they have nothing to say.
*If the seven trumpets are not sequential but are more of a retelling of events that happened during the seven seals, the pause could be the end of the earth age (the sixth seal), and the beginning of the Messianic age (aka, what we call the “age to come”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Messianic Age is often seen as a type of “sabbath rest”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fact, the ancient sages said there would be 6000 years of man fruitless toil, followed by 1000 years of Messiah’s sabbath peace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-82&#34;&gt;Rev 8:2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.  &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seven angels – Judaic tradition during the first century held seven archangels serving on God’s council: Gabriel, Michael, Raphael, Uriel, Saraquel, Raguel, and Remiel (with the first two mentioned directly in the Bible, and the first four being, in a sense, preeminent over the other three&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trumpets
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Called army to war, worshippers to the temple, and told the tribes in the wilderness it was time to move&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trumpet of God sounded when the Torah was given on Mt. Sinai&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seven trumpets blew at Jericho&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rosh Hashana is the Festival of Trumpets – the coming of the Messiah is heralded by Trumpet blasts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isa 27:13  And in that day a great trumpet will be blown, and those who were lost in the land of Assyria and those who were driven out to the land of Egypt will come and worship the LORD on the holy mountain at Jerusalem.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reference to those lost in Assyria would refer to the Assyrian conquest of the northern kingdom – the incident that supposedly led to the &amp;ldquo;10 lost tribes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we said in study of chapter 7, God knows exactly where the 10 tribes are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-83-4&#34;&gt;Rev 8:3-4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;And another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer, and he was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne, and the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before God from the hand of the angel.  &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incense is a frequent symbol for the prayers of the righteous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psa 141:2  Let my prayer be counted as incense before you, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here, the prayers could be the prayers of the martyrs from the 5th seal, calling on God to avenge their blood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here, it could be that their wait is over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Prayers of all the saints&amp;rdquo; could be a reference to John 17:12 &amp;ldquo;While I was with them, I kept them in your name, which you have given me. I have guarded them, and not one of them has been lost except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. &amp;quot;  In other words, every saint is accounted for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-85&#34;&gt;Rev 8:5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth, and there were peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.  &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clearly a judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eze 10:2  And he said to the man clothed in linen, “Go in among the whirling wheels underneath the cherubim. Fill your hands with burning coals from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.” And he went in before my eyes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the beginning of the wrath.  The trumpet can now blow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-86-7&#34;&gt;Rev 8:6-7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Now the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to blow them. The first angel blew his trumpet, and there followed hail and fire, mixed with blood, and these were thrown upon the earth. And a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.  &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hail is often viewed as symbolic of death by stoning; a form of capital punishment reserved for a certain class of crimes such as sexual sin, idolatry, witchcraft, blasphemy, and murder.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is also the punishment for rebellious children, though there are no recorded instances of this punishment being carried out solely for this offense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In later years, a court that handed down more than one death sentence every seven (some say seventy) years was seen as &amp;ldquo;bloodthirsty&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rabbis instituted several legal standards to make capital punishment rare, many of which were violated at Jesus&amp;rsquo; trial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subsequent trumpets will also destroy &amp;ldquo;only&amp;rdquo; 1/3 of their intended targets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2/3 will be left for the wrath to be poured out later (bowls) – the 1/3 is intended to get rebellious man’s attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ezekiel&amp;rsquo;s haircut
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eze 5:1  “And you, O son of man, take a sharp sword. Use it as a barber&amp;rsquo;s razor and pass it over your head and your beard. Then take balances for weighing and divide the hair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eze 5:2  A third part you shall burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are completed. And a third part you shall take and strike with the sword all around the city. And a third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I will unsheathe the sword after them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Explanation) Eze 5:12-13  A third part of you shall die of pestilence and be consumed with famine in your midst; a third part shall fall by the sword all around you; and a third part I will scatter to all the winds and will unsheathe the sword after them. Thus shall my anger spend itself, and I will vent my fury upon them and satisfy myself. And they shall know that I am the LORD—that I have spoken in my jealousy—when I spend my fury upon them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-88-9&#34;&gt;Rev 8:8-9&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;The second angel blew his trumpet, and something like a great mountain, burning with fire, was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood. A third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.   &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sounds like a volcano such as Mt. Vesuvius, which would have been in the recent memory of John&amp;rsquo;s audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sea becoming blood is reminiscent of the first plague of Moses
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exo 7:17-18, 22  Thus says the LORD, “By this you shall know that I am the LORD: behold, with the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water that is in the Nile, and it shall turn into blood.  18  The fish in the Nile shall die, and the Nile will stink, and the Egyptians will grow weary of drinking water from the Nile.”’” 22  But the magicians of Egypt did the same by their secret arts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeremiah envisioned Babylon as a burning mountain
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jer 51:24-25  “I will repay Babylon and all the inhabitants of Chaldea before your very eyes for all the evil that they have done in Zion, declares the LORD.  25  “Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain, declares the LORD, which destroys the whole earth; I will stretch out my hand against you, and roll you down from the crags, and make you a burnt mountain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember, to the original audience, Babylon = Rome, since both had destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our day we have supply chain issues, with pictures of ships backed up in the major ports of the world waiting to unload their cargo.  Imagine 1/3 of the ships filled with cargo being wiped out and the havoc that alone would bring to society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-810-11&#34;&gt;Rev 8:10-11&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, blazing like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water.  The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many people died from the water, because it had been made bitter.  &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wormwood is a bitter root, often used symbolically:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Idolatry (figurative adultery): Deu 29:18  Beware lest there be among you a man or woman or clan or tribe whose heart is turning away today from the LORD our God to go and serve the gods of those nations. Beware lest there be among you a root bearing poisonous and bitter fruit,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Literal adultery:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heb 12:15-16  See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God; that no “root of bitterness” springs up and causes trouble, and by it many become defiled;  16  that no one is sexually immoral or unholy like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pro 5:3-4  For the lips of a forbidden woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil,  4  but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judgment: Jer 9:15 (also Jer 23:15)  Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will feed this people with bitter food, and give them poisonous water to drink.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suffering:
Lam 3:15  He has filled me with bitterness; he has sated me with wormwood.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rth 1:20-21  She said to them, “Do not call me Naomi (pleasantness); call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.  I went away full, and the LORD has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi, when the LORD has testified against me and the Almighty has brought calamity upon me?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laodicea would have been particularly interested in the attack on fresh water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is the star named?  This is not a natural or man-made environmental (nuclear) disaster, but is likely a name of an angelic being sent to poison the waters.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While it&amp;rsquo;s interesting that the Ukrainian name for Chornobyl means mudwort or wormwood, the Chornobyl nuclear disaster can&amp;rsquo;t represent the third trumpet, since there&amp;rsquo;s been no seventh seal or first two trumpets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some view this as Satan (Isa 14:12), but, presumably, Satan has already fallen by the time Wormwood falls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-812&#34;&gt;Rev 8:12&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;The fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of their light might be darkened, and a third of the day might be kept from shining, and likewise a third of the night.  &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Darkening is a common apocalyptic sign for the spiritual host of heaven&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that when a volcano such as Mt. Vesuvius erupted, there were events similar to the sequence of trumpets 2, 3, and 4,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some scholars see natural events, or, more specifically, God directing natural events to accomplish His purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The comparison to a volcano erupting could also be symbolic of a supernatural judgment and the destruction that follows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-813&#34;&gt;Rev 8:13&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Then I looked, and I heard an eagle crying with a loud voice as it flew directly overhead, “Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, at the blasts of the other trumpets that the three angels are about to blow!”  &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Woe is the opposite of the Hebrew &amp;ldquo;ashrei&amp;rdquo;, which we translate as &amp;ldquo;blessed&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The word in Hebrew is &amp;ldquo;oy!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luk 6:22  “Blessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude you and revile you and spurn your name as evil, on account of the Son of Man!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luk 6:26  “Woe to you, when all people speak well of you, for so their fathers did to the false prophets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Eagle was an omen in Roman society – the three woes correspond to the remaining three trumpets
Rev 9:12 after the fifth trumpet: &amp;ldquo;the first woe has passed, behold two more…&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 11:14 after the sixth trumpet: &amp;ldquo;the second woe has passed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third woe is not mentioned but, the seventh trumpet will usher in bowl judgments and the fall of Babylon (Rev 11:15)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These woes were intended to have the earth-dwellers repent, but they did not (Rev 9:20-21)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a reminder, those who were sealed in chapter 7 are protected from these judgments (Rev 9:4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those who dwell on earth is a title – &amp;ldquo;earth-dwellers&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are the ones hostile to God who make the earth their spiritual home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As believers, we dwell in heaven not on earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first four shofar judgments affected nature directly; the last three will affect people directly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our modern vernacular, we might say, &amp;ldquo;you ain&amp;rsquo;t seen nothing yet.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chuck Missler, an engineering major from the Naval Academy, sees a &amp;ldquo;logarithmic progression&amp;rdquo; to the various judgments.  The subsequent judgment is not just the next in the sequence, but exponentially increases in intensity and destruction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-181-2&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:1-2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the LORD appeared to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre while he was sitting at the tent door in the heat of the day. When he raised his eyes and looked, behold, three men were standing opposite him; and when he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed down to the ground,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tents were designed to hold in heat at night but flaps can open to allow breezes during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham does not yet know that these three are supernatural, and we aren’t told when he realizes that they aren’t. Without any fanfare, all of a sudden, he knows he’s talking to the LORD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-183-5&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:3-5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and said, “My Lord, if now I have found favor in Your sight, please do not pass Your servant by. “Please let a little water be brought and wash your feet, and make yourselves comfortable under the tree, and I will bring a piece of bread so that you may refresh yourselves; after that, you may go on since you have visited your servant.” And they said, “So do as you have said.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the standards of the day, Abraham was required to do this, but he went above and beyond, as we shall see in the next passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospitality may have had a pragmatic goal – you never knew when someone approaching could be an enemy. Here was a chance to potentially transform an enemy into a friend, at least temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washing the feet of guests was a standard act of hospitality, given the often dry and dusty roads of the ancient near east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often a bowl was placed by the door and the guest washed their own feet – this appears to be what Abraham offers here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some commentators will note that feet washing was so nasty, typically only the lowest servant could be assigned to wash another’s feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this makes Jesus’ act at the Last Supper all the more remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust&#34;&gt;Walking in His Dust&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 13:2 Do not neglect hospitality to strangers, for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We typically think of entertaining and hospitality as something like a fellowship meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it includes that, more broadly, hospitality includes any act of aid and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of the Good Samaritan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospitality is loving your neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice again God’s ways vs the World’s ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world says look out for #1, never deny our own desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entertaining is OK as long as you get something out of it (showing off the fact that you have the means to host a big party, or maybe cultivate a new business contact).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God says to give selflessly to help others who may never be able to repay you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter elaborates on this: “Above all, keep loving one another earnestly since love covers a multitude of sins. Show hospitality to one another without grumbling. As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God&amp;rsquo;s varied grace: whoever speaks, as one who speaks oracles of God; whoever serves, as one who serves by the strength that God supplies—in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. (1 Peter 4:8-11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-186-8&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:6-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, “Quickly, prepare three measures of fine flour, knead it, and make bread cakes.” Abraham also ran to the herd and took a tender and choice calf and gave it to the servant, and he hurried to prepare it. He took curds and milk and the calf which he had prepared and set it before them, and he was standing by them under the tree as they ate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham was not obligated to prepare a calf; yogurt and bread would have been sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A measure is a seah, which is about 20 quarts. This was a banquet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more onerous of the Jewish dietary restrictions is that one cannot mix dairy and meat; this is curious as right here, Abraham is doing just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In restaurants, there are designated dairy and non-dairy sections; even if your meal doesn’t have any dairy, you are not allowed to sit in the dairy section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restriction comes from Exodus 23:19, which only says, “you are not to boil a young goat in the milk of its mother.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tree is venerated in Hebron today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-189-12&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:9-12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they said to him, “Where is your wife, Sarah?” And he said, “There, in the tent.” He said, “I will certainly return to you at this time next year; and behold, your wife Sarah will have a son.” And Sarah was listening at the tent door, which was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; Sarah was past childbearing. So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, “After I have become old, am I to have pleasure, my lord being old also?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah was in the tent, likely because the tradition was women did not eat with men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1813-16&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:13-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the LORD said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ‘Shall I actually give birth to a child when I am so old?’ “Is anything too difficult for the LORD? At the appointed time, I will return to you, at this time next year, and Sarah will have a son.” Sarah denied it, however, saying, “I did not laugh”; for she was afraid. And He said, “No, but you did laugh.” Then the men rose up from there and looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham was walking with them to send them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without any prior notice, we now learn that the LORD is among the visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have to piece things together but since three men showed up initially and we learn that only two will be in Sodom and those two are angels, the makeup of the three visitors is most likely (allowing for other permutations) the LORD (possibly in the form of pre-incarnate Jesus) and two mighty angels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We note that both Abraham and Sarah laughed but only Sarah was chided for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, it might not be the crime but the cover-up that got her in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard to top the KJV here “Nay, but thou didst laugh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the word for laugh is Tzahaq which is linguistically related to Ytzhaq, Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1817-19&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:17-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do, since Abraham will certainly become a great and mighty nation, and in him, all the nations of the earth will be blessed? “For I have chosen him, so that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing righteousness and justice, so that the LORD may bring upon Abraham what He has spoken about him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham’s grandfather and Shem were alive at the same time; no doubt the story of the Flood was still “fresh” in everyone’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potentially Abraham would see the destruction of Sodom and think the world is ending in judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God averts that by reassuring him this is only a local judgment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1820-22&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:20-22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the LORD said, “The outcry of Sodom and Gomorrah is indeed great, and their sin is exceedingly grave. “I will go down now and see whether they have done entirely as the outcry, which has come to Me indicates; and if not, I will know.” Then the men turned away from there and went toward Sodom while Abraham was still standing before the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our just God is investigating the situation before issuing the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of Genesis 19, with the men banging on the door, was the trial&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 13 will be the verdict “The Lord has sent us to destroy it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hailfire was the penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1823-33&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:23-33&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham approached and said, “Will You indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked? “Suppose there are fifty righteous people within the city; will You indeed sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Far be it from You to do such a thing, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike. Far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth deal justly?” So the LORD said, “If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the entire place on their account.” And Abraham replied, “Now behold, I have ventured to speak to the Lord, although I am only dust and ashes. “Suppose the fifty righteous are lacking five; will You destroy the entire city because of five?” And He said, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he spoke to Him yet again and said, “Suppose forty are found there?” And He said, “I will not do it on account of the forty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he said, “Oh, may the Lord not be angry, and I shall speak; suppose thirty are found there?” And He said, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he said, “Now behold, I have ventured to speak to the Lord; suppose twenty are found there?” And He said, “I will not destroy it on account of the twenty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he said, “Oh, may the Lord not be angry, and I shall speak only this once: suppose ten are found there?” And He said, “I will not destroy it on account of the ten.” As soon as He had finished speaking to Abraham the LORD departed, and Abraham returned to his place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middle eastern haggling is a well-earned stereotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice is not served by ignoring wickedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had there been higher numbers of righteous, the city might have been spared only if they could have exerted a reforming influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, there will not even be 10 righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-191-3&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:1-3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the two angels came to Sodom in the evening as Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he stood up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he said, “Now behold, my lords, please turn aside into your servant’s house, and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may rise early and go on your way.” They said, “No, but we shall spend the night in the public square.” Yet he strongly urged them, so they turned aside to him and entered his house; and he prepared a feast for them and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downward progression of Lot. Now he’s sitting at the gate, which is equivalent to being on the city council or chamber of commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unleavened bread here because they arrived in the evening and there was not time for the bread to rise prior to baking. When they arrived at Hebron it was the middle of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our Gospels study, we noted that John 3 took place at night and John four took place during the day (Jesus moves us from darkness to light).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here Genesis 18 takes place during the day and most of Genesis 19 talkes place at night (sin such as Sodom moves us from light to darkness)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of hospitality is that the host is responsible for the safety and well-being of his guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lot will take this extremely seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-194-5&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:4-5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before they lay down, the men of the city—the men of Sodom—surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter; and they called to Lot and said to him, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may have relations with them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-196-9&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:6-9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Lot went out to them at the doorway, and shut the door behind him,and said, “Please, my brothers, do not act wickedly. “Now look, I have two daughters who have not had relations with any man; please let me bring them out to you, and do to them whatever you like; only do not do anything to these men, because they have come under the shelter of my roof.” But they said, “Get out of the way!” They also said, “This one came in as a foreigner, and already he is acting like a judge; now we will treat you worse than them!” So they pressed hard against Lot and moved forward to break the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1910-13&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:10-13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them, and shut the door. Then they struck the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness, from the small to the great, so that they became weary of trying to find the doorway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the two men said to Lot, “Whom else do you have here? A son-in-law and your sons and daughters, and whomever you have in the city, bring them out of the place;for we are about to destroy this place, because their outcry has become so great before the LORD that the LORD has sent us to destroy it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1914&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, and said, “Up, get out of this place, for the LORD is destroying the city.” But he appeared to his sons-in-law to be joking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1915-17&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:15-17&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Up, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city.” But he hesitated. So the men grasped his hand and the hand of his wife and the hands of his two daughters, because the compassion of the LORD was upon him; and they brought him out and put him outside the city. When they had brought them outside, one said, “Escape for your life! Do not look behind you, and do not stay anywhere in the surrounding area; escape to the mountains, or you will be swept away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1918-19&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:18-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Lot said to them, “Oh no, my lords! “Now behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your compassion, which you have shown me by saving my life; but I cannot escape to the mountains, for the disaster will overtake me and I will die;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1920-22&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:20-22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 now behold, this town is near enough to flee to, and it is small. Please, let me escape there (is it not small?) so that my life may be saved.” And he said to him, “Behold, I grant you this request also, not to overthrow the town of which you have spoken. “Hurry, escape there, for I cannot do anything until you arrive there.” Therefore the town was named Zoar. The sun had risen over the earth when Lot came to Zoar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1924-26&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:24-26&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD rained brimstone and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah from the LORD out of heaven, and He overthrew those cities, and all the surrounding area, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground. But Lot’s wife, from behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1927-28&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:27-28&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Abraham got up early in the morning and went to the place where he had stood before the LORD; and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the surrounding area; and behold, he saw the smoke of the land ascended like the smoke of a furnace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1929-30&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:29-30&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it came about, when God destroyed the cities of the surrounding area, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the destruction, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot had lived. Now Lot went up from Zoar with his two daughters and stayed in the mountains, because he was afraid to stay in Zoar; and he stayed in a cave, he and his two daughters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1931-35&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:31-35&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to have relations with us according to the custom of all the earth. “Come, let’s make our father drink wine, and let’s sleep with him so that we may keep our family alive through our father.” So they made their father drink wine that night, and the firstborn went in and slept with her father; and he did not know when she lay down or got up. On the following day, the firstborn said to the younger, “Look, I slept last night with my father; let’s make him drink wine tonight too, then you go in and sleep with him, so that we may keep our family alive through our father.” So they had their father drink wine that night too, and the younger got up and slept with him; and he did not know when she lay down or got up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1936-38&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:36-38&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so both of the daughters of Lot conceived by their father. The firstborn gave birth to a son, and named him Moab; he is the father of the Moabites to this day. As for the younger, she also gave birth to a son, and named him Ben-ammi; he is the father of the sons of Ammon to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read/hear the passage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revelation 9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;The fifth angel sounded his shofar, and I saw a star that had fallen out of heaven onto the earth, and he was given the key to the shaft leading down to the Abyss. He opened the shaft of the Abyss, and there went up smoke from the shaft like the smoke of a huge furnace; the sun was darkened, and the sky too, by the smoke from the shaft. Then out of the smoke onto the earth came locusts, and they were given power like the power scorpions have on earth. They were instructed not to harm the grass on the earth, any green plant, or any tree, but only the people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads. The locusts were not allowed to kill them, only to inflict pain on them for five months, and the pain they caused was like the pain of a scorpion sting. In those days, people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will elude them. Now, these locusts looked like horses outfitted for battle. On their heads were what looked like crowns of gold, and their faces were like human faces. They had hair like women&amp;rsquo;s hair, and their teeth were like those of lions. Their chests were like iron breastplates, and the sound their wings made was like the roar of many horses and chariots rushing into battle. They had tails like those of scorpions, with stings, and in their tails was their power to hurt people for five months. They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is &amp;ldquo;Abaddon&amp;rdquo; and in our language, &amp;ldquo;Destroyer.&amp;rdquo; The first woe has passed, but there are still two woes to come. The sixth angel sounded his shofar, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the gold altar before God, saying to the sixth angel, the one with the shofar, &amp;ldquo;Release the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates!&amp;rdquo; And they were released. These four angels had been kept ready for this moment, for this day and month and year, to kill a third of mankind, and the number of cavalry soldiers was two hundred million! &amp;mdash;I heard the number. Here is how the horses looked in the vision: the riders had breastplates that were fire-red, iris-blue, and sulfur-yellow; the horses&amp;rsquo; heads were like lions&amp;rsquo; heads; and from their mouths issued fire, smoke, and sulfur. It was these three plagues that killed a third of mankind&amp;mdash;the fire, smoke, and sulfur issuing from the horses&amp;rsquo; mouths. For the power of the horses was in their mouths&amp;mdash;and also in their tails, for their tails were like snakes with heads, and with them, they could cause injury. The rest of mankind, those who were not killed by these plagues, even then did not turn from what they had made with their own hands&amp;mdash;they did not stop worshipping demons and idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood, which cannot see or hear or walk. Nor did they turn from their murdering, their involvement with the occult and with drugs, their sexual immorality, or their stealing.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This passage has an allusion to Joel 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt; &amp;ldquo;Blow a trumpet in Zion; sound an alarm on my holy mountain! Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, for the day of the LORD, is coming; it is near, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness! Like blackness, there is spread upon the mountains a great and powerful people; their like has never been before, nor will be again after them through the years of all generations. Fire devours before them, and behind them, a flame burns. The land is like the garden of Eden before them, but behind them, a desolate wilderness, and nothing escapes them. Their appearance is like the appearance of horses, and like war horses, they run. As with the rumbling of chariots, they leap on the tops of the mountains, like the crackling of a flame of fire devouring the stubble, like a powerful army drawn up for battle. Before them, peoples are in anguish; all faces grow pale. Like warriors, they charge; like soldiers, they scale the wall. They march each on his way; they do not swerve from their paths. They do not jostle one another; each marches in his path; they burst through the weapons and are not halted. They leap upon the city, they run upon the walls, they climb up into the houses, they enter through the windows like a thief. The earth quakes before them; the heavens tremble. The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining. The LORD utters his voice before his army, for his camp is exceedingly great; he who executes his word is powerful. For the day of the LORD is great and very awesome; who can endure it? &amp;ldquo;Yet even now,&amp;rdquo; declares the LORD, &amp;ldquo;return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning;&amp;rdquo; Tear your heart, not your garments; and turn to ADONAI your God. For he is merciful and compassionate, slow to anger, rich in grace, and willing to change his mind about disaster. (Joe 2:1-13) &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-91-2&#34;&gt;Rev 9:1-2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Rev 9:1-2 The fifth angel sounded his shofar, and I saw a star that had fallen out of heaven onto the earth, and he was given the key to the shaft leading down to the Abyss. He opened the shaft of the Abyss, and there went up smoke from the shaft like the smoke of a huge furnace; the sun was darkened, and the sky too, by the smoke from the shaft.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Star
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is no ordinary star because it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;he,&amp;rdquo; and he has a specific task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is a true &amp;ldquo;fallen&amp;rdquo; angel or an angelic messenger doing God&amp;rsquo;s bidding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abyss
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greek Abussos = bottomless pit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hebrew Tehom &amp;ndash; Genesis 1:2 The earth was without form and void, and darkness were over the face of the deep (the Tehom).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gen 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah&amp;rsquo;s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day, all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewish extra-biblical literature, including Dead Sea Scroll documents, held that the leaders of the Nephilim were thrown into the abyss for the day of judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peter picks up this thought: &amp;ldquo;For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment; if he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a herald of righteousness, with seven others when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; (2Pe 2:4-5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes is used in conjunction with She&amp;rsquo;ol &amp;ndash; Jesus holds the keys to She&amp;rsquo;ol (Rev 1:18) &lt;img src=&#34;images/gadara.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; &gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Jesus then asked him, &amp;ldquo;What is your name?&amp;rdquo; And he said, &amp;ldquo;Legion,&amp;rdquo; for many demons had entered him. And they begged him not to command them to depart into the abyss. Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and they begged him to let them enter these. So he gave them permission. Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.&amp;rdquo; (Luk 8:30-33)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clearly, it is a type of prison for demons and, eventually, for Satan himself (Rev 20:3)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The smoke and devastation might be reminiscent of the destruction of Sodom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not surprisingly, abussos appears seven times in Revelation: Rev 9:1, Rev 9:2, Rev 9:11, Rev 11:7, Rev 17:8, Rev 20:1, Rev 20:3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missler speculates that a likely location for a bottomless pit is the earth&amp;rsquo;s center.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is only at the center of the earth where one cannot go &amp;ldquo;down&amp;rdquo; and is therefore bottomless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is like the riddle about a man who walks 100 yards south of his camp and finds bear tracks. He tracks the bear 100 yards to the west and kills it. He then goes 100 yards north back to his base. What color was the bear?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The answer is the bear has to be white, i.e., a polar bear. The only place one can walk south, west, then north and end up back where he started is the north pole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the way, according to National Geographic, scientists estimate the temperature at the center of the earth is a balmy 9,392 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not a door we want to be opened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-93-5&#34;&gt;Rev 9:3-5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Rev 9:3-5 Then out of the smoke onto the earth came locusts, and they were given power like the power scorpions have on earth. They were instructed not to harm the grass on the earth, any green plant, or any tree, but only the people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads. The locusts were not allowed to kill them, only to inflict pain on them for five months, and the pain they caused was like the pain of a scorpion sting.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the previous trumpets attacked nature, these supernatural locusts were forbidden to do any more damage.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While destructive, ordinary locusts eat vegetation only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locusts were the 8th of the Egyptian plagues (Exodus 10:12).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those whom God has sealed are preserved through the judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for the view that the visions in Revelation are not necessarily sequential might be seen by comparing 9:4 with 8:7, which says ALL green grass was burned up (1/3 of the earth, 1/3 of the trees, but ALL green grass). There shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be any grass left to burn if this is sequential and chronological.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The standard biblical month has 30 days, so five months is 150 days, the same length of time as Noah&amp;rsquo;s flood (Gen 7:24).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potentially, John is communicating that the pain from a sting will last five months. Yikes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-96&#34;&gt;Rev 9:6&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Rev 9:6 In those days people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will elude them.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I join with many commentators who say words to the effect of &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine what this means.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeremiah 8:3 Death shall be preferred to life by all the remnant that remains of this evil family in all the places where I have driven them, declares the LORD of hosts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-97-11&#34;&gt;Rev 9:7-11&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Rev 9:7-11 Now, these locusts looked like horses outfitted for battle. On their heads were what looked like crowns of gold, and their faces were like human faces. They had hair like women&amp;rsquo;s hair, and their teeth were like those of lions. Their chests were like iron breastplates, and the sound their wings made was like the roar of many horses and chariots rushing into battle. They had tails like those of scorpions, with stings, and in their tails was their power to hurt people for five months. They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is &amp;ldquo;Abaddon&amp;rdquo; and in our language, &amp;ldquo;Destroyer.&amp;rdquo; The first woe has passed, but there are still two woes to come.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Parthians (see the comment at verse 13) had long hair, while those in Roman lands generally had shorter hair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are not natural locusts.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a common biblical idiom to say that a sizeable advancing army is like locusts.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judges 6:5 For they would come up with their livestock and their tents; they would come like locusts in number&amp;mdash;both they and their camels could not be counted&amp;mdash;so that they laid waste the land as they came in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural locusts have no king, but these do
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pro 30:27, the locusts have no king, yet all of them march in rank;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Septuagint translation of Amos 7:1 is curious: The Lord has shown me and behold, a swarm of locusts were coming, and behold one of the devastating young locusts was God the King.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amos 7:1 in other translations is nearly nonsensical: &amp;ldquo;This is what the Lord GOD showed me: behold, he was forming locusts when the latter growth was just beginning to sprout, and behold, it was the latter growth after the king&amp;rsquo;s mowings.&amp;rdquo; (Amo 7:1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will see Gog again in Rev 20:8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greek Apollyon means &amp;ldquo;destroyer.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though not linguistically related, the audience might have associated with Apollo, reportedly Domitian&amp;rsquo;s patron deity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abaddon is another Hebrew word referencing Sheol or the Abusso
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pro 27:20 Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied, and never satisfied are the eyes of man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Job 26:6 Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering. What seems to be happening is an army of demons is released to wreak havoc for five months; they can hurt but can&amp;rsquo;t kill, or as Keener states, &amp;ldquo;the armies of hell, sent by death itself to fill its bowels.&amp;rdquo; &amp;lt;Zotero Keener Rev 9:11&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-91315&#34;&gt;Rev 9:13:15&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Rev 9:13-15 The sixth angel sounded his shofar, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the gold altar before God, saying to the sixth angel, the one with the shofar, &amp;ldquo;Release the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates!&amp;rdquo; And they were released. These four angels had been kept ready for this moment, for this day and month and year, to kill a third of mankind;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/incense1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Altar of Incense&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:left&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;images/incense2.png&#34; alt=&#34;Altar of Incense&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The four horns of the gold altar is the Altar of Incense (on which the prayers were placed in the last chapter), and it is now talking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exodus 30:1, 3, 7-8 (KJV) &amp;ldquo;And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim wood shalt thou make it . . . And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about . . . And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps . . . a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also known as the &amp;ldquo;golden altar&amp;rdquo; or the &amp;ldquo;inner altar,&amp;rdquo; this three-foot-high altar was the location of regular incense offerings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every morning and evening when tending the light of the menorah, the priests would offer a mixture of frankincense and other aromatic gums.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we discussed, this was the function of Zechariah, John the Baptist&amp;rsquo;s father, in Luke 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the Day of Atonement, the high priest would sprinkle blood on the horns of this altar (Exod 30:10), but nothing besides incense was ever to burn here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The altar also had a unique saving purpose. One guilty of causing an accidental death could present himself to the priest and take sanctuary by grabbing the horns of the altar. As long as he was touching the horns he couldn&amp;rsquo;t be touched.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Euphrates
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In John&amp;rsquo;s day, the Euphrates was the boundary between Rome and the feared Parthians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traditionally, the Euphrates is the eastern boundary of the promised land (Genesis 15:18)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Euphrates is mentioned in reference to Eden (Genesis 2:14), which runs through the heart of Babylon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some speculate that since Eden was to the &amp;ldquo;east&amp;rdquo; (meaning east of Israel), Eden was possibly located near ancient Mesopotamia/Babylon. Thus Babylon can be said to be where the first sin and first murder occurred, where the Tower of Babel was built, and where Nimrod founded his rebellion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This group of bound angels (likely fallen) is allowed to kill 1/3 of mankind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-916-19&#34;&gt;Rev 9:16-19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Rev 9:16 and the number of cavalry soldiers was two hundred million!&amp;mdash;I heard the number. Here is how the horses looked in the vision: the riders had breastplates that were fire-red, iris-blue, and sulfur-yellow; the horses&amp;rsquo; heads were like lions&amp;rsquo; heads; and from their mouths issued fire, smoke, and sulfur. It was these three plagues that killed a third of mankind&amp;mdash;the fire, smoke, and sulfur issuing from the horses&amp;rsquo; mouths. For the power of the horses was in their mouths&amp;mdash;and also in their tails, for their tails were like snakes with heads, and with them, they could cause injury.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 200,000,000 man army from the east may evoke images of China in our day, but the 1st-century audience would have understood it as a reference to the Parthians
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number was likely figurative language for &amp;ldquo;a huge invading force,&amp;rdquo; as 200,000,000 likely exceeded the entire population of Earth in the 1st Century&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we discussed previously, the Parthians were expert horsemen and the often-used flaming arrows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/chimeria.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Altar of Incense&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;&gt;
-   This appears to be a description of the Greek mythical chimera, with the head of a lion, the body of a goat, and the tail of a snake.
-   Fans of the Left Behind series might be interested to note that the fictional Nicholai Carpathia, the Antichrist, hailed from Romania (as it is speculated that the antichrist will be somehow connected to the revived Roman Empire.  
    The Romanian flag&#39;s colors are blue, yellow, and red, the three colors mentioned in this passage.
    -   As Isaiah refers to an &#34;Assyrian&#34; antichrist, it might be more likely that the Antichrist will come from the eastern lands of the old Roman Empire.
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-920-21&#34;&gt;Rev 9:20-21&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Rev 9:20 The rest of mankind, those who were not killed by these plagues, even then did not turn from what they had made with their own hands&amp;mdash;they did not stop worshipping demons and idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood, which cannot see or hear or walk Nor did they turn from their murdering, their involvement with the occult and with drugs, their sexual immorality or their stealing.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is reminiscent of Pharoah&amp;rsquo;s hardening of his heart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While we can celebrate God&amp;rsquo;s bringing justice to the wicked, we must remember that at some level, He loves those whom He&amp;rsquo;s doomed to destruction.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to God&amp;rsquo;s justice, the judgments are also an act of mercy designed to produce repentance.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The threat of judgment did produce repentance with Nineveh in Jonah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It usually does not, as was the case with Pharoah and as is the case here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul equated worship of the Roman gods with demon-worship - No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons. (1 Cor 10:20) - While idols of clay and stone are not real (1 Co 8:4, Psa 115:4-8), the spirit behind the idol definitely is demonic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This sounds like modern society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pharmakeia is translated as sorcery in other translations
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let us not limit our thinking to illicit street drugs but also the modern pharmaceutical industry, remaking our chemistry into something perhaps, it was never meant to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wonder how much of what we might label mental illness is genuinely demonic manifestations related to legal and illegal drug use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The good news is God can rescue anyone with a hurt, habit, or hang-up, including substance abuse; I believe this includes healing a mind that had been chemically altered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;revelation-10&#34;&gt;Revelation 10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; Next I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven. He was dressed in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head; his face was like the sun, his legs like columns of fire; and he had a little scroll lying open in his hand. He planted his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land and shouted in a voice as loud as the roar of a lion; and when he shouted, seven thunderclaps sounded with voices that spoke. When the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven say, &amp;quot;Seal up the things the seven thunders said, do not write them down!&amp;quot; Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted his right hand toward heaven and swore by the One who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and what is in it, earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it: &amp;quot;There will be no more delay; on the contrary, in the days of the sound from the seventh angel when he sounds his shofar, the hidden plan of God will be brought to completion, the Good News as he proclaimed it to his servants the prophets.&amp;quot; Next, the voice which I had heard from heaven spoke to me again and said, &amp;quot;Go, take the scroll lying open in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the land!&amp;quot; So, I went over to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll; and he said to me, &amp;quot;Take it and eat it. It will turn your stomach bitter, but in your mouth, it will be sweet as honey.&amp;quot; I took the little scroll from the angel&#39;s hand and ate it; and in my mouth, it was sweet as honey; but after I had swallowed it, my stomach turned bitter. Then I was told, &amp;quot;You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;daniel-12&#34;&gt;Daniel 12&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we have a brief intermission between the 6th and 7th trumpets, just as we did between the 6th and 7th seals. We have the seven thunders here, and, in Chapter 11, we will have the two witnesses. It&amp;rsquo;s important to keep in mind that when John wrote this, there were no such things as chapter breaks. As best we can, we need to remove the chapter breaks and read Revelation as a single continuous document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 10 has many similarities to Daniel 12:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Daniel 12:1-10: &amp;ldquo;At that time shall arise, Michael, the great prince who has charge of your people. And there shall be a time of trouble, such as never has been since there was a nation till that time. But at that time, your people shall be delivered, everyone whose name shall be found written in the book. And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. And those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the sky above; and those who turn many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever. But you, Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book until the time of the end. Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase.&amp;rdquo; Then I, Daniel, looked, and behold, two others stood, one on this bank of the stream and one on that bank of the stream. And someone said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream, &amp;ldquo;How long shall it be till the end of these wonders?&amp;rdquo; And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream; he raised his right hand and his left hand toward heaven and swore by him who lives forever that it would be for a time, times, and half a time, and that when the shattering of the power of the holy people comes to an end all these things would be finished. I heard, but I did not understand. Then I said, &amp;ldquo;O my lord, what shall be the outcome of these things?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;Go your way, Daniel, for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of the end. Many shall purify themselves and make themselves white and be refined, but the wicked shall act wickedly. And none of the wicked shall understand, but those who are wise shall understand.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-101-3&#34;&gt;Rev 10:1-3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head, and his face was like the sun and his legs like pillars of fire. He had a little scroll open in his hand. And he set his right foot on the sea, his left foot on the land, and called out with a loud voice, like a lion roaring. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another angel. Mighty angel #1 was in Rev 5:2, And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is Mighty angel #2. Apparently, he&amp;rsquo;s large, with one foot on land and the other on sea, but also large in authority and dominion. The mission is the entire world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He comes with the clouds&amp;rdquo; is a familiar description of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rainbow was the covenant sign God gave to Noah after the Flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Face like the sun and legs like bronze are descriptions from Revelation 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here is a hint that John was at least thinking in Hebrew&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hebrew has the same word for feet and legs; however, only legs can be said to be pillars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John or a scribe picked the wrong Greek word to translate the Hebrew word for legs. He used the Greek word for feet, which is why most translations have this as &amp;ldquo;feet like pillars,&amp;rdquo; which is somewhat nonsensical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roaring like a lion is reminiscent of the Lion of the tribe of Judah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not Jesus (directly) but is an angelic representation of Jesus &amp;ndash; likely the same angel that spoke with John in Revelation 1-3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John is borrowing from Jewish liturgy &amp;ndash; Daniel 10:6, as well as extrabiblical passages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We assume the scroll is the scroll from Chapter 5, now opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translating this as &amp;ldquo;book&amp;rdquo; is technically an anachronism. Loose-leaf papers were just starting to come into use, but we don&amp;rsquo;t believe there was formal bookbinding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-103-4&#34;&gt;Rev 10:3-4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; When he called out, the seven thunders sounded. And when the seven thunders had sounded, I was about to write, but I heard a voice from heaven saying, &amp;ldquo;Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and do not write it down.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven Thunders is a mystery &amp;ndash; apparently, John knew what they were, but the mystery will remain a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculating is pointless! Not everything the receiver sees is meant to be passed on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteronomy 29:29  The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul evidently received some type of apocalyptic vision, but he, too, was told to keep it sealed. 2 Cor 12:4 and he heard things that cannot be told, which man may not utter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-105-6&#34;&gt;Rev 10:5-6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven and swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and what is in it, the earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it, that there would be no more delay, &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is to this day, raising one&amp;rsquo;s right hand to heaven (or to a pagan god as the case may be) indicates taking an oath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan 12:7 he raised his right hand and his left hand toward heaven and swore by him who lives forever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promise of the redemption has been delayed since the days of Moses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more delay, recalls Paul&amp;rsquo;s warning in Romans 9:28: for the Lord will carry out his sentence upon the earth fully and without delay. The prayers of the martyred saints are about to be answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until now, God has been delaying judgment so the lost will have time to repent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are saved, you and I need to be very humbled by this delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-107&#34;&gt;Rev 10:7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;but that in the days of the trumpet call to be sounded by the seventh angel, the mystery of God would be fulfilled, just as he announced to his servants the prophets. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALL promises and prophecies will be fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes promises of judgment as well as promises of restoration and redemption (i.e. the coming of Messiah).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of &amp;ldquo;mysteries&amp;rdquo; in the New Testament including four in the book of Revelation, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:49.3.4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eph 3:4&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; When you read this, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:49.3.5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eph 3:5&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, &amp;ldquo;Go, take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.&amp;rdquo; So I went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll. And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;Take and eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth, it will be sweet as honey.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/small&gt;Ezekiel 2:8-3:3 &amp;ldquo;But you, son of man, hear what I say to you. Be not rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you.&amp;rdquo; [9] And when I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me, and behold, a scroll of a book was in it. [10] And he spread it before me. And it had writing on the front and on the back, and there were written on it words of lamentation and mourning and woe. And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;Son of man, eat whatever you find here. Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.&amp;rdquo; So I opened my mouth, and he gave me this scroll to eat. And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;Son of man, feed your belly with this scroll that I give you and fill your stomach with it.&amp;rdquo; Then I ate it, and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, John is being commissioned like one of the Old Testament prophets. Jeremiah and Isaiah have similar &amp;ldquo;commissioning&amp;rdquo; scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; Psa 119:97-104 Mem Oh how I love your law! It is my meditation all the day. Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies, for it is ever with me. I have more understanding than all my teachers, for your testimonies are my meditation. I understand more than the aged, for I keep your precepts. I hold back my feet from every evil way, in order to keep your word. I do not turn aside from your rules, for you have taught me. How sweet are your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth! Through your precepts I get understanding; therefore I hate every false way.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 119 is an acrostic poem; there are 22 separate sections, one for each letter in the Hebrew alphabet, and each verse in that section begins with the same letter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

And I was told, &amp;ldquo;You must again prophesy about many peoples and nations and languages and kings.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To those who believe, the Words of God bring sweetness and life; to those who refuse to believe, the words bring bitterness and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The believer takes no joy in preaching the wrath of God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One has to know (&amp;ldquo;ingest&amp;rdquo;) the Word; then he is ready to be a witness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we get to Chapter 11 and the famous two witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2023 Trip Journal #1: Shephelah</title>
      <link>https://talmidimway.com/sites/2023-blog/23-trip-journal-1-shephelah/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://talmidimway.com/sites/2023-blog/23-trip-journal-1-shephelah/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;compromising--january-11-2023&#34;&gt;Compromising – January 11, 2023&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was especially exciting because, although this is not my first time in Israel, every site we visited was one I&amp;rsquo;d not seen before.  The theme of the day was compromising (Samson at Beth Shemesh) vs. being faithful (David v. Goliath at the Valley of Elah).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;related-devotionals&#34;&gt;Related Devotionals:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azekah: 
 &lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
   &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/U2QqSph7j7Q&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

Bet Guvrin: 
 &lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
   &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zqSC8LS1KbI&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;yad-hashmonah&#34;&gt;Yad HaShmonah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We began the day by visiting Yad HaShmonah biblical garden.  The first thing our guide Ronan pointed it is that in the Bible, a garden has nothing to do with flowers.   It revolves around the seven spices of Deuteronomy 8: wheat, barley, grapes, figs, pomegranates, olives, and dates.  There is also a replica watchtower, synagogue, and rolling stone tomb.  In general, we learned all about life in ancient Israel.  This is very near the area of Kiryat Jearim where we recounted the saga of the Ark&amp;rsquo;s capture and subsequent return by the Philistines in 1st Samuel 4-7.  The story began by the Israelites&amp;rsquo; going into battle without God.  Then instead of calling upon God the way Joshua and Moses did, they thought all they needed was the Ark, which was basically supposed to be a good luck charm of sorts.  It&amp;rsquo;s a great story full of geographic references and, more importantly, personal application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;beth-shemesh&#34;&gt;Beth Shemesh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We next moved just over the hill to Beth Shemesh and the Sorek valley, which is the setting of one of the more famous compromisers, Samson.  &lt;em&gt;Almost&lt;/em&gt; every location referenced in Judges 13-16 is visible from Beth Shemesh and almost every act of Samson involves some form of compromise.  Yet, there he is in Hebrews 11.  That should give all of us hope!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also at Beth Shemesh was an example of an ancient cistern. Pastor Randy then had us read Jeremiah 38 where Jeremiah was thrown into a muddy cistern.  As we were standing in a slightly muddy cistern, the passage came to life.  The photo below is looking up at the roof with the opening.  The cave was completely dark without flashlights.  Other references to being thrown into or lifted out of a pit such as Psalm 40 and &lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; Jesus before Caiaphas also came to mind (in what could be Caiaphas’ house, they found a dungeon/pit, where possibly prisoners were kept.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:8.66667in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;azekah&#34;&gt;Azekah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there it was to Azekah and the story of David and Goliath.  Azekah is a hill overlooking the valley.  We could see the hills where 1 Samuel 17 records the Philistine and Israelite armies, and of course the valley itself, where we stopped to gather 5 smooth stones from the brook just as David did.  On this day, David did not compromise.  Of the many directions Pastor Rich could have with this wonderful story, he focused on David as the unlikely savior of Israel and how Jesus is also unlikely.  He&amp;rsquo;s not the Hero you&amp;rsquo;re looking for.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick devotional I recorded [youtube url=&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2QqSph7j7Q&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2QqSph7j7Q&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;].  We also discussed some reasons from archeology we can have even more confidence in the biblical account of David and Solomon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:8.66667in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bet-guvrin&#34;&gt;Bet Guvrin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We concluded the day with a visit to Bet Guvrin, known in Old Testament times as Mareshah.  This is the home of Micah the prophet.  In Micah 6, God calls the hills around Mareshah to be the jury as he presents his case.   Here is another brief devotional: [youtube url=&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqSC8LS1KbI&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqSC8LS1KbI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then took a beautiful sunset/dusk drive through the Negev desert and Judean wilderness on our way to the hotel at the Dead Sea.  Here is our route according to Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:6.02014in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:5.92361in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These episodes take place primarily in Gerar and Beersheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham relocates to Gerar, a pagan kingdom (blue arrow towards Gerar) where he has another lack of faith (he didn&amp;rsquo;t learn the lesson from Egypt) in which he tells a 1/2 truth that Sarah was his sister.  God intervened again to preserve the purity of his promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac, the son of the Promise (Gal 4:23-26) is born possibly at Gerar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 21, Abraham makes a treaty with the king of Gerar at Beersheva - well of seven/oath&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-201&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there Abraham journeyed toward the territory of the Negeb and lived between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason we don’t have many archeological remains from this period is the nomadic lifestyle. People like Abraham moved somewhere, then moved on, often being deliberate about not leaving a trace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all Hebrew words have the accent on the last syllable. One exception is certain two syllable word that have a short e vowel. So the word for desert is not pronounced nuh-GEV, but NEH-gev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerar is possibly a region, not a specific city, but many archeologists point to this location about 15 miles northwest of Beersheva as the likely location.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kadesh, or Kadesh Barnea, will become a pivotal location later in the Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is here that the 12 spies returned. When the 10 brought back a bad report and spread fear through the camp, a riot ensued. As punishment, God sentenced the people to wander in the wilderness for 38 more years (a total of 40), while that generation died off, except for the two spies who brought back a good report: Joshua and Caleb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-202&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oy vey!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the eighth test of Abraham, according to the sages. He doesn’t do so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sometimes face the same challenges repeatedly because we keep getting them wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever blind spot Abraham has in his faith, he, unfortunately, passes it down to Isaac, who will pull the same ruse with Rebekah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 99-year-old woman was desirable. She must have been extremely beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abimelech comes from two Hebrew words, Avi – my father and Melech – king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is probably a title, “my father the king” (like a “lord and master” title in medieval times) versus a given name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-203-5&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:3-5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man&amp;rsquo;s wife.” Now Abimelech had not approached her. So he said, “Lord, will you kill an innocent people? Did he not himself say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In one of the many mysteries of God, He periodically makes Himself known to non-Israelites. He also does this with Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar. Even more puzzling is that none of the three are recorded as putting their faith in the God of Abraham despite the divine encounter. Nebuchadnezzar comes closest in Daniel 4, but there is little historical evidence that he had a major change of heart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-206-8&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:6-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her. Now then, return the man&amp;rsquo;s wife, for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you, and you shall live. But if you do not return her, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours.” So Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things. And the men were very much afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling Abraham a “prophet” might have been a term that Abimelech understood to mean Abraham had a unique relationship with his God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham was not necessarily a giver of prophecy the way we think of the term (as it relates to Elijah, Isaiah, and so forth).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prophecy is not limited to the prediction and fulfillment of future events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prophet is someone who speaks the words of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pragmatically, Abimelech also would have understood that as a prophet, Abraham had the ability to bless Abimelech, which in his mind would have equated to material blessings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-209-10&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:9-10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done.” And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you see, that you did this thing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s not wrong. Abraham blew his witness here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the way the KJV words 2 Sam 12:14. 2 Samuel 12:14 (KJV) by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is when Nathan confronts David over his sin with Bathsheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the other translations say something to the effect of “because you have disrespected the Lord.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KJV focuses on the end result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we mess up publicly we misrepresent God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re supposed to be God’s ambassadors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our character represents His character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You didn’t just disrespect the Lord, which is bad enough. Your behavior reflected so poorly on your king that they blasphemed Him.” Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did you see? I love that choice of words. We have a natural tendency to literally or figuratively see things that aren’t real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learn from verse 17 that there was a plague of barrenness upon Abimelech’s house because of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, some time would have needed to elapse before making the conclusion that they were afflicted with barrenness, yet this all apparently happened on the night Abimelech took Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would they know this was a plague from God in one night?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s just say one speculation is that Abimelech and his men needed to ask their doctor whether a particular class of medication was right for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another might be that those about to give birth were prevented from doing so; including hens unable to lay eggs according to the Talmud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, the text is clear that nothing happened between Sarah and Abimelech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To underscore this and dispel any notion that Abimelech was the father of Isaac, Jewish tradition holds that Isaac’s physical appearance was in all respects identical to Abraham&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, mocking traditions would later arise that Abimelech was the father of Isaac, just as mocking traditions arose that Jesus had a natural biologic father, whether by Joseph or a Roman soldier named Pantera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac foreshadows Jesus in many ways, the greatest of which we will see next time in Genesis 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2011-13&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:11-13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham said, “I did it because I thought, ‘There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’ Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife. And when God caused me to wander from my father&amp;rsquo;s house, I said to her, ‘This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seemed like a good idea at the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His assessment was incorrect. There WAS a fear of God in that place and Abimelech respected the boundaries of marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get into trouble when we draw unsolicited conclusions about another’s spiritual status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck Missler used to say “don’t draw vast conclusions from half-vast data.” (Let me know when you get the pun.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is much better to give our neighbors the benefit of the doubt unless/until proven otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another “sire an Ishmael” moment, though God spared Abraham any negative consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A half-truth with an intent to deceive is a full lie. In the same way, spreading an embarrassing fact about someone else with the intent to hurt that person is gossip and slander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see that Abraham devised this con before coming to the promised land. When we come to God, we need to cleanse out our old ways. For some of us, a lifetime is not enough, but we still try to live a God-honoring life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible does not hide the flaws of its leaders. It is possible to be a man or woman who is used mightily by God yet still flawed. That should give us encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2014-16&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:14-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him. And Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you.” To Sarah, he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is a sign of your innocence in the eyes of all who are with you, and before everyone, you are vindicated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1000 shekels is about 25 pounds of silver, more than a worker could expect to make in a lifetime.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s Abimelech’s guarantee that Sarah was untouched and an appeasement to the prophet of the deity who cursed Abimelech’s household with barrenness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it’s not a gift, it’s a transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham upholds his end of the contract in verse 17 and God is appeased in verse 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to give Abimelech due credit here – even though he did not wrong Abraham with prior knowledge or intent; he still makes it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-his-dust-talmidim-way-insight&#34;&gt;In His Dust Talmidim Way Insight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have wronged someone, we are obligated to ask for forgiveness.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages teach that even though Abimelech made financial restitution, his full atonement came when he asked Abraham to intercede with prayer to God. Abimelech would have had to ask Abraham for this, so it follows that Abimelech had to ask Abraham for forgiveness for any anguish he caused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Forgive others, that God may forgive you” (e.g., Mat 6:14-15) is not exclusively a New Testament idea; it is well attested to in the Talmud. It’s a Jewish concept that our Jewish Messiah teaches us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought is not that God’s forgiveness is conditional; it is unconditional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought is, how can we call ourselves &lt;em&gt;talmidim&lt;/em&gt; if we ask God for forgiveness but refuse to forgive others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the important aspects of Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, is seeking forgiveness for the sins we did not even know we committed. I wish Christianity had a day like that. An entire day devoted to getting right with God and our neighbors. Sign me up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ephesians 4:32 Be kind to one another, compassionate, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2017-18&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:17-18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children. For the LORD had closed all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham&amp;rsquo;s wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham’s intercession brings immediate spiritual and physical relief; even though up to this point, Abraham’s prayers for he and Sarah to have a child have remained unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is because Abraham prayed for others that allowed God to bless Abraham and Sarah with Isaac. What’s holding you back from praying for others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrative Abraham and Abimelech continues in Genesis 21:22&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;revelation-11&#34;&gt;Revelation 11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; I was given a measuring rod like a stick and told, &amp;quot;Get up, and measure the Temple of God and the altar, and count how many people are worshipping there! But the court outside the Temple, leave that out; don&#39;t measure it; because it has been given to the Goyim, and they will trample over the holy city for forty-two months. &amp;quot;Also, I will give power to my two witnesses; and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, dressed in sackcloth.&amp;quot; These are the two olive trees and the two menorahs standing before the Lord of the earth. If anyone tries to do them harm, fire comes out of their mouth and consumes their enemies&amp;mdash;yes, if anyone tries to harm them, that is how he must die. They have the authority to shut up the sky so that no rain falls during the period of their prophesying; also, they have the authority to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want. When they finish their witnessing, the beast coming up out of the Abyss will fight against them, overcome them and kill them; and their dead bodies will lie in the main street of the great city whose name, to reflect its spiritual condition, is &amp;quot;S&#39;dom&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Egypt&amp;quot;&amp;mdash;the city where their Lord was executed on a stake. Some from the nations, tribes, languages, and peoples see their bodies for three-and-a-half days and do not permit the corpses to be placed in a tomb. The people living in the Land rejoice over them, they celebrate and send each other gifts, because these two prophets tormented them so. But after the three-and-a-half days a breath of life from God entered them, they stood up on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them. Then the two heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, &amp;quot;Come up here!&amp;quot; And they went up into heaven in a cloud, while their enemies watched them. In that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were awestruck and gave glory to the God of heaven. The second woe has passed; see, the third woe is coming quickly. The seventh angel sounded his shofar; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, &amp;quot;The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and his Messiah, and he will rule forever and ever!&amp;quot; The twenty-four elders sitting on their thrones in God&#39;s presence fell on their faces and worshipped God, saying, &amp;quot;We thank you, Adonai, God of heaven&#39;s armies, the One who is and was, that you have taken your power and have begun to rule. &amp;quot;The Goyim raged. But now your rage has come, the time for the dead to be judged, the time for rewarding your servants the prophets, and your holy people, those who stand in awe of your name, both small and great. It is also the time for destroying those who destroy the earth.&amp;quot; Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened, and the Ark of the Covenant was seen in his Temple; and there were flashes of lightning, voices, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and violent hail.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler notes a few elements related to setting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time: first half of 70th week of Daniel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place: Begins in Jerusalem, specifically note Israel has a restored Temple. Ends in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a distinction between Jews and nations, which Stern calls &amp;ldquo;Goyim.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goyim&lt;/em&gt; are those gentiles/gentile nations at enmity with God and His people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gentiles in the church are supposed to be &lt;em&gt;Ger Toshav&lt;/em&gt; not goyim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ger Toshav is the term in the Hebrew Bible to denote non-Jews who follow the God of Israel. Literally, it means &amp;ldquo;resident alien&amp;rdquo; but connotatively it refers to a &amp;ldquo;righteous gentile.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly many in the church throughout history have acted more like goyim, leading most Jews to refer to Christians as Goyim, but that&amp;rsquo;s for another discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, the above distinction between Jews and Goyim, with no mention of the church, leads many to believe that the church is not present during this period in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are roughly midway through the book&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 11 will see the conclusion of the 2nd woe and the beginning of the 7th Trumpet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-111-2&#34;&gt;Rev 11:1-2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; I was given a measuring rod like a stick and told, &amp;quot;Get up, and measure the Temple of God and the altar, and count how many people are worshipping there! 2 But the court outside the Temple, leave that out; don&#39;t measure it; because it has been given to the Goyim, and they will trample over the holy city for forty-two months.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;temple&#34;&gt;Temple:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 24:15 says &amp;ldquo;when you see the abomination&amp;hellip;standing in the holy pace&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, there has to be a temple standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been well past 42 months since the destruction of the Temple when Revelation was written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either this prophecy had to be fulfilled before 70 CE or there is another temple yet future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enemies of God have had a particular fascination with destroying or desecrating the Jewish Temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 63:18 Your holy people held possession for a little while; our adversaries have trampled down your sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a story that Vespasian wanted to see the inside of the temple but by the time he arrived, the fires had already started and prevented him from entering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some view this as God going out of his way to make sure Mt 24:15 was not fulfilled by Vespasian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional view held by most Jews for the past 2000 years, is that the Dome of the Rock now stands where the Jewish temple once did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The octagonal shape of the shrine suggests it was built on top of an earlier byzantine church, which would have been built on top of the temple to Zeus, erected by emperor Hadrian in the 130s CE. Hadrian also placed a statue of himself on a horse over the Holy of Holies. Of course he did these things as an afront to Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing he did was rename the land Syria Palestina, after the Philistines, the traditional enemies of the Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made it up out of thin air &amp;ndash; there never was a historical country of Palestine and there is no historical people who were Palestinians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in many ways I&amp;rsquo;m not unsympathetic to the plight of Arabs who have been caught in the middle of a political tug of war since the end of World War I, we can&amp;rsquo;t deny the fact they have had to resort to rewriting history and propaganda to establish their legitimacy. That propaganda has been very effective, proving the old adage that if you repeat a lie often enough it becomes the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for there to be a third Temple, most assume the Dome of the Rock must be destroyed, a notion that understandably alarms Muslims, who view the Dome as their sacred space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some modern archaeologists hypothesize that there might be a way to rebuild the temple without disturbing the Dome. In other words, the temple was not exactly where the Dome is today but north according to one conjecture, or south, according to another.

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, both proponents can make a compelling case for their position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The northern hypothesis is intriguing because it has the Dome located in the outer court, the court of the gentiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when John was told not to measure the area of the outer court of the Goyim, it could be another way of saying &amp;ldquo;Leave the Dome of the Rock alone&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the skills of the Anti-christ is as a false peacemaker. We assume he will convince the Jews and Muslims to somehow share the space so he can erect his false temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Qumran, the Essenes viewed the Temple as symbolic of God&amp;rsquo;s chosen remnant. The Essenes were a separatist sect who refused to acknowledge the authority of the corrupt Saduccean temple priestly class and are widely credited with being the authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;measure&#34;&gt;Measure:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezekiel 40:3-5 He brought me there, and behold, there was a man whose appearance was like bronze. He had a linen cord in his hand and a measuring rod. He was standing in the gateway. The man said to me, &amp;ldquo;Son of man, see with your eyes, hear with your ears, set your heart on all that I show you&amp;mdash;for I brought you here in order to show you&amp;mdash;and report all that you see to the house of Israel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture here is proper ownership. When you visit a friend&amp;rsquo;s house, do you bring a pencil and tape measure? Of course not. How about when you first moved into your current house? Did you measure anything? I bet you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also measurement as a preamble to destruction. Say you only need six feet of an eight-foot board. In that case, you would measure and mark the board before you cut. Then after you cut, you&amp;rsquo;re going to &amp;ldquo;cast out&amp;rdquo; the unneeded pieces. The goyim are about to be cast out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;holy-city&#34;&gt;Holy City:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one place on earth labeled &amp;ldquo;the holy city&amp;rdquo; by God. It&amp;rsquo;s Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;trample&#34;&gt;Trample:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recalls Luke 21:24. They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led away captive into all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 52:1 Awake, awake! Clothe yourself in your strength, Zion! Clothe yourself in beautiful garments, Jerusalem, the holy city, for the uncircumcised and the unclean will never invade you again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;forty-two-months&#34;&gt;Forty-two months:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I.e., 3.5 years &amp;ndash; God appears to be going out of His way to let us know this length of time is literal, not figurative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time, times, and a half of time (Rev 12:14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1260 days (Rev 11:3, 12:5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;42 months (Rev 11:2; 13:5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Missler says, &amp;ldquo;God does everything to tell us this is literally 3.5 months except giving it to us in nanoseconds!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-113&#34;&gt;Rev 11:3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;3 &amp;quot;Also I will give power to my two witnesses; and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, dressed in sackcloth.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the emphatic possessive &amp;ndash; MY two witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two are the required number of witnesses before the law Deut 17:6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Moses sent 12 witnesses or spies, two came back with a good report (Joshua and Caleb)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joshua learned the lesson and only sent two witnesses into Jericho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As many have noted, they were not on a reconnaissance mission to bring back military intel. They went into Jericho to get Rahab saved. They were two witnesses, not two spies in the traditional sense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sackcloth speaks of mourning, humbling, and repentance. As they are in Jerusalem, Stern speculates that they are petitioning God on behalf of Jewish people in Jerusalem, as well as testifying about Jesus to the Jewish people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-114&#34;&gt;Rev 11:4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;4 These are the two olive trees and the two menorahs standing before the Lord of the earth.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zec 4:12-14 And a second time I answered and said to him, &amp;ldquo;What are these two branches of the olive trees, which are beside the two golden pipes from which the golden oil is poured out?&amp;rdquo; He said to me, &amp;ldquo;Do you not know what these are?&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;No, my lord.&amp;rdquo; Then he said, &amp;ldquo;These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the imagery is of a high priest and king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-115-6&#34;&gt;Rev 11:5-6&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;5 If anyone tries to do them harm, fire comes out of their mouth and consumes their enemies&amp;mdash;yes, if anyone tries to harm them, that is how he must die.They have the authority to shut up the sky, so that no rain falls during the period of their prophesying; also they have the authority to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to see Moses and Elijah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elijah was promised in Mal 4:5-6 and Moses was promised in Deut 18:15-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joh 1:21 And they asked (John the Baptist), &amp;ldquo;What then? Are you Elijah?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;I am not.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Are you the Prophet (I.e. Moses)?&amp;rdquo; And he answered, &amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses and Elijah&amp;rsquo;s ministies could said to be &amp;ldquo;unfinished&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses Num 20:12 And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, &amp;ldquo;Because you did not believe in me, to uphold me as holy in the eyes of the people of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land that I have given them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elijah 2Ki 2:11 And as they still went on and talked, behold, chariots of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them. And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Mount of Transfiguration, Jesus held a &amp;ldquo;staff meeting&amp;rdquo; with Moses and Elijah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miracles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call fire from Heaven &amp;ndash; Elijah &amp;ndash; 1 Kings 18:37&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Revelation, the fire comes from their mouths - Jer 5:14 Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of hosts: &amp;ldquo;Because you have spoken this word, behold, I am making my words in your mouth a fire, and this people wood, and the fire shall consume them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shut up heaven to stop the rain &amp;ndash; Elijah &amp;ndash; 1 Ki 17:1 Now Elijah the Tishbite, of Tishbe in Gilead, said to Ahab, &amp;ldquo;As the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, before whom I stand, there shall be neither dew nor rain these years, except by my word.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn water into blood and smite the earth with plagues are Moses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exo 7:17 Thus says the LORD, &amp;ldquo;By this you shall know that I am the LORD: behold, with the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water that is in the Nile, and it shall turn into blood.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative view has Enoch and Elijah because both did not die&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enoch is supposed to be a picture of the raptured church though, so if you&amp;rsquo;re pre-trib, you have to explain what he is doing in the middle of the tribulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition (before the New Testament) holds that it&amp;rsquo;s Elijah and Enoch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They would say that this can&amp;rsquo;t be Moses because Moses already died; but there are other people, such as Lazarus, who were raised from the dead only to die again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circumstances of Moses&amp;rsquo; death were unusual&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD Himself buried Moses in a secret location (Deu 34:5-6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jude 1:9 But when the archangel Michael, contending with the devil, was disputing about the body of Moses, he did not presume to pronounce a blasphemous judgment, but said, &amp;ldquo;The Lord rebuke you.&amp;rdquo; (Jude says this like his readers would obviously understand the reference to Michael contending with the devil over the body of Moses!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately we aren&amp;rsquo;t told who they are so we can&amp;rsquo;t be dogmatic. It may be Moses and Elijah, Enoch and Elijah, or it may be two other people entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-117-8&#34;&gt;Rev 11:7-8&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;7 When they finish their witnessing, the beast coming up out of the Abyss will fight against them, overcome them and kill them and their dead bodies will lie in the main street of the great city whose name, to reflect its spiritual condition, is &amp;quot;S&#39;dom&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Egypt&amp;quot;&amp;mdash;the city where their Lord was executed on a stake.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the first mention of the antichrist, who is now in power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerusalem is a type of the world out of order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is supposed to be God&amp;rsquo;s Holy City (Rev 11:2) but since it is being trampled over by the Gentiles, it is spiritually equivalent to Sodom or Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the thought that throughout its history, there have been corrupt Jerusalem authorities who have oppressed the true followers of God, just as Egypt did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can note the antichrist &amp;ldquo;overcomes&amp;rdquo; the witnesses &amp;ndash; Jesus says the church will not be overcome by the gates of Hades (Mt 16:18), suggesting the church is not here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-119-10&#34;&gt;Rev 11:9-10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;9 Some from the nations, tribes, languages and peoples see their bodies for three-and-a-half days and do not permit the corpses to be placed in a tomb. The people living in the Land rejoice over them, they celebrate and send each other gifts, because these two prophets tormented them so.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For as it is written, &amp;ldquo;Psa 79:2-3 &amp;ldquo;They have given the bodies of your servants to the birds of the heavens for food, the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the earth. They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very creepy celebration. Antichristmas? When the world vilifies the godly, you know there&amp;rsquo;s a satanic spirit behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refusing to bury the dead was an unspeakable cruelty (hence, the &amp;ldquo;shock&amp;rdquo; from Jesus&amp;rsquo; refusal to accept the excuse of a would-be disciple that the man needed to bury his father).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jerusalem was destroyed in 70 CE, apparently there were bodies of dead Jews rotting everywhere with Roman soldiers gloating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type of resurrection on the third day is not followed here. This is obviously a 4th-day resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we talked about when we studied the resurrection of Lazarus, Jewish tradition held that on the 4th day, one was &amp;ldquo;definitely&amp;rdquo; dead. In other words, decomposition was setting in and there is no hope of resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;People living in the land&amp;rdquo;, this is our term &amp;ldquo;Earth dwellers&amp;rdquo; from Revelation 3:10 - I will keep you from the hour of trial that is coming on the whole world, to try those who dwell on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1111-12&#34;&gt;Rev 11:11-12&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;11 But after the three-and-a-half days a breath of life from God entered them, they stood up on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them. Then the two heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, &amp;quot;Come up here!&amp;quot; And they went up into heaven in a cloud, while their enemies watched them.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For as it is written in Eze 37:5 &amp;ldquo;Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nations, tribes, languages, and peoples are going to see the bodies and then see them be resurrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be big news on CNN and MSNBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to tradition, Moses disappeared in a cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elijah was called up supernaturally. 2Ki 2:11 And as they still went on and talked, behold, chariots of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them. And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was taken up in a cloud in Act 1:9: And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1113-14&#34;&gt;Rev 11:13-14&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;13 In that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were awestruck and gave glory to the God of heaven. The second woe has passed; see, the third woe is coming quickly.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a great earthquake at the 6th seal (Rev 6:12) and now here, effectively, at the conclusion of the 6th trumpet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel lies along the western edge of the largest fault line on earth that runs from Syria to Mozambique&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10th could represent a tithe that is the LORD&amp;rsquo;s (Lev 27:30-34)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7000 &amp;ndash; another connection to Elijah &amp;ndash; 1 Kings 19:18 Yet I will leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we do see something unusual &amp;ndash; some people actually repented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this thought, 7000 could be a 10th of the population of Jerusalem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember trumpets #5-7 were described as three woes. The second woe has passed. It&amp;rsquo;s now time for the seventh trumpet, which will bring upon the final seven bowl judgments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1115-17&#34;&gt;Rev 11:15-17&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;15 The seventh angel sounded his shofar; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, &amp;quot;The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and his Messiah, and he will rule forever and ever!&amp;quot; The twenty-four elders sitting on their thrones in God&#39;s presence fell on their faces and worshipped God, saying, &amp;quot;We thank you, Adonai, God of heaven&#39;s armies, the One who is and was, that you have taken your power and have begun to rule.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see the scroll is sweet and bitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God&amp;rsquo;s Kingdom Rule is upon us, which is sweetness for the believer. Yet, this means judgment and destruction for the unbelievers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heading-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1118&#34;&gt;Rev 11:18&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;18 &amp;quot;The Goyim raged. But now your rage has come, the time for the dead to be judged, the time for rewarding your servants the prophets, and your holy people, those who stand in awe of your name, both small and great. It is also the time for destroying those who destroy the earth.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalms 2:1-6 Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and against his Anointed, saying, &amp;ldquo;Let us burst their bonds apart and cast away their cords from us.&amp;rdquo; He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord holds them in derision. Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying, &amp;ldquo;As for me, I have set my King on Zion, my holy hill.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the result of the &amp;ldquo;utopia&amp;rdquo; by having it their own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God hates sin and loves righteousness and justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 110:5 The Lord is at your right hand; he will shatter kings on the day of his wrath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1119&#34;&gt;Rev 11:19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;19 Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened, and the Ark of the Covenant was seen in his Temple; and there were flashes of lightning, voices, peals of thunder, an earthquake and violent hail. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the scene switches back to heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original Ark is not lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some view the &amp;ldquo;Mercy Seat&amp;rdquo; (the cover of the Ark) will be the Throne of the Messiah during the millennial reign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ark of the COVENANT &amp;ndash; the covenant was associated with blessings for the righteous and curses for the disobedient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to miss, but here we are seeing into the Holy of Holies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the crucifixion, a thick curtain separated the Holy of Holies from the Holy Place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the high priest could go into the Holy of Holies, and that was only once a year on Yom Kippur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the crucifixion, the veil/curtain was torn from top to bottom, and here in Revelation 11, it is exposed to open view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may evoke the Ark going before the Israelites to war (such as in the conquest of Jericho)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lightning, voices, thunder, etc all recall the giving of the Torah at Sinai, which we have looked at previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exodus 19:16-20 - On the morning of the third day there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud on the mountain and a very loud trumpet blast, so that all the people in the camp trembled. Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain. Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the LORD had descended on it in fire. The smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain trembled greatly. And as the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in thunder. The LORD came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. And the LORD called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener writes, &amp;ldquo;this suggests John&amp;rsquo;s revelation is understood as a revelation on the same level as Moses&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;seven-great-openings&#34;&gt;Seven Great Openings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The door in heaven opened (Rev 4:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seals opened (Rev 6-8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abyss opened (Rev 9:2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temple of God opened (Rev 11:19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tabernacle of testimony opened (Rev 15:5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heaven opened (Rev 19:11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Books of Judgment opened (Rev 20:12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;perspective---were-never-alone&#34;&gt;Perspective - we&amp;rsquo;re never alone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;1 Kings 19&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “So may the gods do to me and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by this time tomorrow.” Then he was afraid, and he arose and ran for his life and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there. But he himself went a day&amp;rsquo;s journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a broom tree. And he asked that he might die, saying, “It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life, for I am no better than my fathers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he lay down and slept under a broom tree. And behold, an angel touched him and said to him, “Arise and eat.” And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water. And he ate and drank and lay down again. And the angel of the LORD came again a second time and touched him and said, “Arise and eat, for the journey is too great for you.” And he arose and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mount of God. There he came to a cave and lodged in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said to him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said, “I have been very jealous for the LORD, the God of hosts. For the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword, and I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he said, “Go out and stand on the mount before the LORD.” And behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the mountains and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind. And after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake. And after the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire the sound of a low whisper. And when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And behold, there came a voice to him and said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?” He said, “I have been very jealous for the LORD, the God of hosts. For the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword, and I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it away.” And the LORD said to him, “Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus. And when you arrive, you shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria. And Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint to be king over Israel, and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah you shall anoint to be prophet in your place. And the one who escapes from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu put to death, and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha put to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet I will leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen in front of him, and he was with the twelfth. Elijah passed by him and cast his cloak upon him. And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, “Let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.” And he said to him, “Go back again, for what have I done to you?” And he returned from following him and took the yoke of oxen and sacrificed them and boiled their flesh with the yokes of the oxen and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose and went after Elijah and assisted him.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orange arrow from Gerar (box 6) towards Egypt marks the expulsion of Ishmael and Hagar into the wilderness of Beersheba&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separation was necessary to protect the son of the promise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red arrow from Beersheba to Jerusalem (box 7) denotes the path to and from the offering of Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Map credit&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-21-and-romans-galatians-and-hebrews&#34;&gt;Genesis 21 and Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An understanding of Genesis 21 is paramount to understanding Paul’s/Hebrew’s arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews and only these three New Testament books discuss Genesis 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acts references the birth of Isaac; James and Hebrews reference the sacrifice of Isaac in Genesis 22.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to read Galatians and come away that Paul was somehow anti-law or anti-Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This train of thought is deeply flawed and runs the risk of missing Paul’s points entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is focused not on Judaism as a whole, but on the Messiah-rejecting Jews who are knowingly or unknowingly continuing in legalism instead of accepting the free gift the Messiah brings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, the three books, and only these three New Testament books quote Habakkuk 2:4 (KJV) “but the just shall live by his faith.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews seem to form a trilogy on Habakkuk 2:4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme of Romans: who are the justified?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme of Galatians: how shall the justified live?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme of Hebrews: faith in the promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads many to suspect Paul is the author of Hebrews. If he did not, this is an even greater miracle, because whoever wrote Hebrews unknowingly completed the trilogy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-211-3&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:1-3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD took note of Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for Sarah as He had promised. So Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him. Abraham named his son who was born to him, the son whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:23 But the son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, and the son by the free woman through the promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:11 By faith even Sarah herself received the ability to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other translations say “God remembered Sarah.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not that God forgot, but that He remembered His promise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Appointed time” = &lt;em&gt;mo’ed.&lt;/em&gt; The Jewish festivals are Moedim. Shabbat is a moed. A moed is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Isaac was born on a festival day, just as some speculate Jesus might have been born on Yom Kippur or the first day of Tabernacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either day fits – He is our atonement and he dwells/tabernacles among us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Bible uses a miraculous birth to indicate that God has set aside that child for some great purpose.” (SOM 94)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yitzhak is related to the Hebrew verb &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;צחק&lt;/span&gt;, which means to laugh, but often carries a nuanced connotation of mocking/scorning or even sexual play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’ll unpack more at verse 9.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-214-7&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:4-7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. Now Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me.” And she said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have given birth to a son in his old age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically, in an age of high infant mortality rates, eight days, an infant was considered viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac was circumcised according to the letter of the law on the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is contrasted with Ishmael, who was circumcised at age 13; he was still circumcised, but in a typological sense, not when he “should” have been according to the Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the nuanced meaning of Tzahaq, this may not necessarily be laughing in joy, but laughing in amazement. Sarah and Abraham both laughed in disbelief and perhaps mockery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac’s birth was a true miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an overarching theme in the Bible of God miraculously opening a closed womb. This extends to Mary; although she was not barren in the traditional sense, her womb was miraculously opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God made EVERYTHING in Sarah come to life – she didn’t just give birth but was able to nurse for a couple of years after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-218-10&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:8-10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. Now Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking Isaac. Therefore she said to Abraham, “Drive out this slave woman and her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not be an heir with my son Isaac!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode becomes symbolic of the affliction of the Hebrew/Jewish people throughout the ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:29 But as at that time the son who was born according to the flesh persecuted the one who was born according to the Spirit, so it is even now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:31 So then, brothers and sisters, we are not children of a slave woman, but of the free woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to some reckonings, the 400 years of suffering and affliction culminating in the exodus from Egypt begins with this affliction of Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t have much background on any tradition of a weaning feast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know who Hagar is, but the Narrator wants us to remember her as “Hagar the Egyptian.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did Ishmael do that was so bad that he and his mother had to be driven out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s this word Tzahaq again, translated as mocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Laughter can be used for good or for ill.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:8 Now it came about, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked down through a window, and saw them, and behold, Isaac was &lt;strong&gt;caressing&lt;/strong&gt; his wife Rebekah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caressing = sporting = “Tzahaqing”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael ridiculing and poking fun at his younger brother probably wouldn’t have led to the banishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael was quite possibly a sexual predator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah refuses to speak his name. Whatever it was, it had to be bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust-along-the-talmidim-way&#34;&gt;Walking In His Dust Along The Talmidim Way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;talmidim-must-drive-out-fleshly-works-and-sin-from-our-lives&#34;&gt;Talmidim must drive out fleshly works and sin from our lives.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 5:7 Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, just as you are in fact unleavened. For Christ our Passover also has been sacrificed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another theme in the Bible is the firstborn son doing something to forfeit his inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, the firstborn son receives a double portion of the father’s estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the son does something wicked, he forfeits his promise; then the next in line receives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Ishmael but Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Esau but Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Reuben (and not Simeon or Levi) but Judah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we have an especially odd situation. Joseph was the firstborn of Jacob’s favorite wife Rebekkah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judah receives the official double portion, but Joseph also receives a double portion with Ephraim and Manaesseh being adopted by Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2111-13&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:11-13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matter distressed Abraham greatly because of his son Ishmael. But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed because of the boy and your slave woman; whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her, for through Isaac your descendants shall be named. “And of the son of the slave woman I will make a nation also, because he is your descendant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:28 And you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 9:7 nor are they all children because they are Abraham’s descendants, but: “THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS SHALL BE NAMED.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:18 it was he to whom it was said, “THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS SHALL BE NAMED.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banishment of Ishmael is Abraham’s 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see here that he was reluctant and was “distressed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He loved Ishmael.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His specific tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did he trust God to take care of him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did he trust God’s promises to make Ismael a great nation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did he trust Sarah’s judgment after the last time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial of Ishmael prepared him for the final test in Genesis 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God had previously promised a great future for Ishmael, but Isaac is the one who will inherit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s curious that the Narrator added, “whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her…”. Certainly, this was not the case in Genesis 16 or Genesis 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genesis 3:17 Then to Adam He said, “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat from it’; Cursed is the ground because of you; With hard labor you shall eat from it All the days of your life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2114-16&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:14-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Abraham got up early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water, and gave them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder, and gave her the boy, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered about in the wilderness of Beersheba. When the water in the skin was used up, she left the boy under one of the bushes. Then she went and sat down opposite him, about a bowshot away, for she said, “May I not see the boy die!” And she sat opposite him, and raised her voice and wept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:24 This is speaking allegorically, for these women are two covenants: one coming from Mount Sinai giving birth to children who are to be slaves; she is Hagar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:31 So then, brothers and sisters, we are not children of a slave woman, but of the free woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern makes an interesting comment at Galatians 4:24, “Nowhere does the account in Genesis denigrate Hagar, hense there is no reason to demean the Mosaic Law on the basis of this passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the Torah or Judaism, but people who have perverted the Torah and Judaism into a legalistic system, which is equivalent to a return to slavery in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is essentially the same territory where she wandered in chapter 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned in Israel that in Abraham’s day, towns were generally situated about a day’s journey apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He outfitted her with one day’s provisions with the expectation that she would “refuel” at the next town, perhaps Beersheba 15 miles from Gerar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, she doesn’t make it and heads into the wilderness/desert south of Beersheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did she make it but was turned away because of her “status”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could she not make it that far?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps distressed, did she meander aimlessly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2117-19&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:17-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God heard the boy crying; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What is the matter with you, Hagar? Do not fear, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. “Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him by the hand, for I will make a great nation of him.” Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another significant well moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as in chapter 16, God again sees Hagar and provides materially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also reiterates His promises that Hagar had forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well was there; she just couldn’t see it. That’s a picture of us some days. We can’t open our eyes enough to see the blessing before us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Romans and Galatians, many of us have a dim view of Hagar and Ishmael – certainly, some of this is deserved and as biblical types, they represent the things that we are supposed to reject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s remember the Bible’s worst sinners are pictures of you and me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael messed up “bigly.” We mess up too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here God reaches out and offers both Hagar and Ishmael His mercy and protection. We can be critical because it doesn’t appear that this mercy had any lasting effect. One would have hoped that they could have followed the God of Abraham. We have the same choices when God shows us mercy. How often does God bail us out or see us through a tough spot only to have us forget about God a few moments later?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust-along-the-talmidim-way-1&#34;&gt;Walking In His Dust Along The Talmidim Way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;when-things-seem-hopeless-talmidim-look-for-gods-promises&#34;&gt;When things seem hopeless, talmidim look for God’s promises.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes life hits us and we lose focus. When things seem bleak and we despair, we may need to open our eyes to the goodness of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Peter 3:14-15 But even if you should suffer for righteousness&amp;rsquo; sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2120-21&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:20-21&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God was with the boy, and he grew; and he lived in the wilderness and became an archer. He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paran is in the northeastern Sinai desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This region figures prominently in the Wilderness wanderings (specifically Numbers 13, where Kadesh-Barnea is located).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2122-24&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:22-24&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, “God is with you in all that you do. Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my descendants or with my posterity, but as I have dealt kindly with you, so you will deal with me and with the land where you have sojourned.” And Abraham said, “I will swear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a great testimony. I hope it can someday be said of me “God is with you in all that you do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, God is with me in all that I do; but I don’t always live my life in a way that others recognize it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Abraham’s duplicity, his relationship with Abimelech blossoms into a fruitful and symbiotic partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oaths are legally binding – this is more than a handshake agreement between friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2125&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:25&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Abraham reproved Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech&amp;rsquo;s servants had seized, Abimelech said, “I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it until today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a contract, one party has the right to notify the other if there is a potential material breach. Abraham is doing that here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beersheba is at the northern edge of the Negev desert. Even today, south of Beersheba is sparsely populated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not much water, so what little water there is becomes a hot commodity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our tour guide’s wife is a hydrologist for the nation of Israel – even today, providing enough water for the population is of paramount interest. In the last ten years, the primary water source has shifted from the Jordan River and the Sea of Galilee to desalinated seawater from the Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-his-dust-talmidim-way-insight&#34;&gt;In His Dust Talmidim Way Insight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you reprove someone who has wronged you, have the good in mind.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can learn from Abraham’s admonishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham was not angry, nor seeking to get even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He confronted Abimelech with the goal of restoring their relationship; a relationship Abimelech didn’t even know was injured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge of a leader is that you can’t know everything, but it’s your job to know everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham is reminding Abimelech that it was his job to know that his men were behaving dishonestly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 18:15 “Now if your brother sins, go and show him his fault in private; if he listens to you, you have gained your brother.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to rebuke someone; do it one on one and ideally in person; not on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps an associated insight is we need to &lt;em&gt;receive bad news as an improvement opportunity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can take the position that Abraham’s goal was not to tattle but to build Abimelech up as a leader. This is of course in addition to remedying the immediate situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior executive I worked with paraphrased the famous line from the Godfather, “I want to hear good news right away and bad news immediately.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fostering that kind of culture in an organization takes time but it is critical in our families and ministries as well as our businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the other person is not bringing the criticism forward in a spirit of edification, if the substance of the criticism has merit, we can still learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 3:19 ‘Those whom I love, I rebuke and discipline; therefore be zealous and repent.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2127-28&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:27-28&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant. Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than when it involves Sarah, Abraham is highly skilled as a negotiator and at resolving conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I take comfort in this – I was generally successful as a business executive and viewed as a capable and effective leader; yet I often struggle with leading my own family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheva literally means “seven”; because of this episode, it also comes to mean “oath.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2129-31&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:29-31&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?” He said, “These seven ewe lambs you will take from my hand, that this may be a witness for me that I dug this well.” Therefore that place was called Beersheba, because there both of them swore an oath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells turnout to be extremely significant in scripture. In John 4, Jacob’s well plays a prominent supporting role in the story of Jesus and the Samaritan woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beersheba means literally “well of the seven” but denotatively, “well of the oath.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2132&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:32&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army rose up and returned to the land of the Philistines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit anachronistic as there were not yet Philistines in the coastal plain areas. Egyptians and Canaanites, yes; Philistines, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrator clarifies the geographic location for a later audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first mention of the Philistines in history is around 1180 BC; we believe Abraham lived around 2000 or 1900 BC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s similar to referring to “native Americans” who were around these lands long before the term “America” was used as a geographic label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2133-34&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:33-34&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God. And Abraham sojourned many days in the land of the Philistines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tamarisk is a good tree for the desert. It grows in sandy soil and provides ample shade and food for herbivores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Israel, we learned that “conquering the land” is not always a military campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planting trees, literal and figurative roots in the land, is another way Abraham conquered the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Zionists started to move back around the turn of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, much of the northern part of the country was a swamp. They imported Eucalyptus trees from Australia which sucked up all the water. The land is fertile once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Israel boasts that it plants more trees than it harvests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everlasting in Hebrew is “olam”; it can also mean “world” or “universe”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost all Jewish blessings start with “Baruch ata Adonai Eloheinu, Melech haOlam,” Blessed are you Lord our God, King of the Universe.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we have tension and conflict, we should certainly seek God’s council for relief and godly wisdom on handling the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just don’t forget to call on His name after He delivers you from the test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;revelation-12&#34;&gt;Revelation 12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Rev 11:19) Then God&amp;rsquo;s temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple. There were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. She was pregnant and was crying out in birth pains and the agony of giving birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. 3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a &lt;strong&gt;great red dragon&lt;/strong&gt;, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. 4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the &lt;strong&gt;dragon&lt;/strong&gt; stood before &lt;strong&gt;the woman&lt;/strong&gt; which was ready to be delivered, for to &lt;strong&gt;devour&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;her child&lt;/strong&gt; as soon as it was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. 5 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne. 6 And the &lt;strong&gt;woman fled into the wilderness&lt;/strong&gt;, where she hath a &lt;strong&gt;place&lt;/strong&gt; prepared of God, that they should feed her there a &lt;strong&gt;thousand two hundred and threescore days.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C. 7 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, 8 And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. 9 And the great &lt;strong&gt;dragon was cast out,&lt;/strong&gt; that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was &lt;strong&gt;cast out into the earth&lt;/strong&gt;, and his angels were cast out with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D. 10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. 11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. 12 Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C&amp;rsquo;. Woe to the inhabiters of the &lt;strong&gt;earth&lt;/strong&gt; and of the sea! for the &lt;strong&gt;devil is come down&lt;/strong&gt; unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.13 And when the dragon saw that he was &lt;strong&gt;cast unto the earth&lt;/strong&gt;, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B&amp;rsquo;. 14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might &lt;strong&gt;fly into the wilderness&lt;/strong&gt;, into her &lt;strong&gt;place&lt;/strong&gt;, where she is nourished for &lt;strong&gt;a time, and times, and half a time&lt;/strong&gt;, from the face of the serpent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A&amp;rsquo;. 15 And the &lt;strong&gt;serpent&lt;/strong&gt; cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood. 16 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth. 17And the &lt;strong&gt;dragon&lt;/strong&gt; was wroth with the woman, and went to &lt;strong&gt;make war&lt;/strong&gt; with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction----declarations-of-war&#34;&gt;Introduction &amp;ndash; Declarations of War&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chapter break probably should have occurred after 11:18. Here the scene shifted to the heavenly throne room, and this perspective is continued in Chapter 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things that began in Genesis have their fulfillment in Revelation. In the account of the Fall, we actually have two declarations of war. In Genesis 3:1-5 we have the serpent declaring war on humanity, and then in Genesis 3:15, we have God declaring war on the serpent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;genesis-31-19&#34;&gt;Genesis 3:1-19&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, &amp;ldquo;Did God actually say, &amp;lsquo;You shall not eat of any tree in the garden&amp;rsquo;?&amp;rdquo; And the woman said to the serpent, &amp;ldquo;We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden, but God said, &amp;lsquo;You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; But the serpent said to the woman, &amp;ldquo;You will not surely die. For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.&amp;rdquo; So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate. Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths. And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden. But the LORD God called to the man and said to him, &amp;ldquo;Where are you?&amp;rdquo; And he said, &amp;ldquo;I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?&amp;rdquo; The man said, &amp;ldquo;The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate.&amp;rdquo; Then the LORD God said to the woman, &amp;ldquo;What is this that you have done?&amp;rdquo; The woman said, &amp;ldquo;The serpent deceived me, and I ate.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;The LORD God said to the serpent, &amp;ldquo;Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field; on your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life. I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; To the woman he said, &amp;ldquo;I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children. Your desire shall be contrary to your husband, but he shall rule over you.&amp;rdquo; And to Adam he said, &amp;ldquo;Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, &amp;lsquo;You shall not eat of it,&amp;rsquo; cursed is the ground because of you; in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life; thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 3:15 the word for offspring is literally seed. Missler points out this is a biological &amp;ldquo;contradiction.&amp;rdquo; The seed is in the man, not the woman. Missler sees a hint of the virgin birth way back in Genesis 3. In any case, the war between the seeds has raged for the last 6000 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we continue with these complex visions, we are reminded that in Revelation 1:19, John was told, &amp;ldquo;Write therefore the things that you have seen, those that are and those that are to take place after this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, strictly speaking, John is supposed to be a court reporter. He&amp;rsquo;s not supposed to comment, interpret, or rework the visions to fit his understanding. Many commentators interpret these chapters as a coded diatribe against Rome, which might be true of John was tailoring the work to fit his own viewpoint. He did that in his epistles and his gospel, but he was specifically told NOT to do that with Revelation. We know from the text that at certain points John is as clueless as we are about what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a glimpse into the supernatural world, which is very difficult for us because we live in the natural world. At the same time, God commands us to read and understand this book to the best of our abilities. Frequently this involves going beyond John&amp;rsquo;s immediate situation with the Roman empire and into the world of the Old Testament prophets, who wrote during the Babylonian and Persian empires, and of Moses who wrote during the Egyptian dynasties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-121-2&#34;&gt;Rev 12:1-2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. She was pregnant and was crying out in birth pains and the agony of giving birth.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned, the chapter should have begun with 11:19, so we are still in Heaven and we need to connect the Ark of the Covenant with the woman clothed with the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ancient readers familiar with the Bible would especially recognize here the story of Israel giving birth to Jesus and Satan&amp;rsquo;s opposition to God&amp;rsquo;s people.&amp;rdquo; Keener&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may not be so much forecasting a future event as it is a retelling of past events from the spiritual (warfare) perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On earth, we are bound by the dimension of time. Einstein proved that time is a physical property that varies with mass, acceleration, and gravity. God is not subject to time and heaven is not bound by time. This means our past and our future as seen from earth are somehow morphed together from the heavenly perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verse 1, we begin with Jacob and the 12 tribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verse specifically references Joseph&amp;rsquo;s prophecy: Gen 37:9 Then he dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers and said, &amp;ldquo;Behold, I have dreamed another dream. Behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where it is obvious, we don&amp;rsquo;t have to speculate. We let Scripture define Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph himself is the 12th star, his 11 other brothers are the 11th star, and the Sun and Moon are Isaac and Rebekkah &amp;ndash; in other words, the woman clothed with the sun moon and 12 stars is the nation Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verse 2, we have the woman, the nation Israel, in her ups and downs as she prepares to bring forth her Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 66:7-10 &amp;ldquo;Before she was in labor she gave birth; before her pain came upon her she delivered a son. Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? Shall a nation be brought forth in one moment? For as soon as Zion was in labor, she brought forth her children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dead Sea Scrolls also spoke of the righteous remnant of Israel travailing to give birth (either to a saved Israel&amp;mdash;cf. Rev 12:17&amp;mdash;or to the Messiah; the precise referent is disputed &amp;ndash; perhaps both are true). Cf. Joh 16:21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have speculated that the woman is the Church, but the Church did not give birth to the Messiah. We also have a type problem &amp;ndash; the church is the virgin bride of Christ, but here the woman is pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others speculated Mary. While Mary was the literal, immediate mother of the Messiah, this vision of the woman and the dragon goes far beyond literal Mary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the 2nd of four women in Revelation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jezebel Rev 2:20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel Rev 12:1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation is often portrayed as the bride of Adonai; sometimes faithful, sometimes not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The giving of the Torah at Sinai is very similar to a Jewish wedding celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is also often described as a woman in travail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The harlot who rides the beast Rev 17:3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bride Rev 19:7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replacement Theology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some scholars refuse to see this woman as Israel because they hold to a doctrine called &amp;ldquo;Replacement Theology.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the view that when Israel rejected her Messiah, she forfeited the promises. Those promises transferred to the Church, making the church &amp;ldquo;Spiritual Israel&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problems with Replacement Theology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the promises were UNCONDITIONAL &amp;ndash; if something is given to you unconditionally, there is nothing you can do to violate the terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 9-11 state very clearly that God has NOT forsaken Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus has yet to fulfill the promise given to Mary to take DAVID&amp;rsquo;S throne (Luke 1:21).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we are demonstrating, Revelation is a work of Jewish apocalyptic literature. Israel is in view; a fact that is underscored by beginning this section with the Ark of the Covenant, symbolic of all of God&amp;rsquo;s promises and covenants to Israel which remain in full force and effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-123&#34;&gt;Rev 12:3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;And another sign appeared in heaven: behold, a great red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learn from verse 9 that the dragon is identified with the serpent of Genesis 3, the devil, and Satan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word for red only appears here and in Rev 6:5, the red horse. In other words, we should associate it with blood and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were ancient myths about seven-headed creatures (Babylon, Greece, and even the Leviathan mentioned in Psalms, Isaiah, and Job is viewed as a primeval serpent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten horns recall the prophecies of Daniel of the fourth major empire, (Babylon, Persia, Greece, and ROME) &amp;ndash; note here they are wearing diadems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan 7:24-25 As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise, and another shall arise after them; he shall be different from the former ones and shall put down three kings. He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change the times and the law, and they shall be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will see this beast again in Revelation 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note this verse says only 10 horns, nothing about seven heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible that John is seeing a combination of all four of Daniel&amp;rsquo;s beasts rolled into one dragon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beast #1 (Dan 7:4) &amp;ndash; Lion (presumed to be Babylon) &amp;ndash; 1 head and 0 horns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beast #2 &amp;ndash; (Dan 7:5) Bear (Medio-Persia) &amp;ndash; 1 head and 0 horns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beast #3 &amp;ndash; (Dan 7:6) Leopard (Greek) &amp;ndash; 4 heads and 0 horns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beast #4 &amp;ndash; (Dan 7:7) Dreadful (Rome) &amp;ndash; 1 head and 10 horns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total: 7 heads and 10 horns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is popular to view the beast as a revised roman empire, it could be that Satan is behind ALL of man&amp;rsquo;s systems and governments from Adam and Eve to today (yes, including America), and will be defeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heading-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-124&#34;&gt;Rev 12:4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;His tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she bore her child he might devour it.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the scene shifting from heaven to earth. It&amp;rsquo;s important to keep track of where we are (and remember our discussion that earth is time-bound while heaven most likely is not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stars are widely viewed as fallen angels. (Luke 10:18 &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.&amp;rdquo;.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the moment God declared war in Genesis 3:15, the Enemy began his attacks on the Messianic line, beginning with the murder of Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catalyst for the Flood was satan&amp;rsquo;s attempt to corrupt the human DNA (Genesis 6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once it became known that the Messiah would come from Judah, satan attacked Judah&amp;rsquo;s line personally. We can read about that in the sordid tale of Judah and Tamar in Genesis 38.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharaoh tried to wipe out the Hebrews in Exodus 1 and Exodus 14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This continues through David and the attacks on him and the royal line of kings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are instances where all of the brothers are wiped out except for one who was hidden away to keep the line going. (2 Kings 11, 2 Chronicles 21, 22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan even &amp;ldquo;tricks&amp;rdquo; God into pronouncing a bloodcurse upon the royal line: Jer 22:30 Thus says the LORD: &amp;ldquo;Write this man (Jeconiah) down as childless, a man who shall not succeed in his days, for none of his offspring shall succeed in sitting on the throne of David and ruling again in Judah.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The messiah has to come from the royal line, yet God just pronounced a curse upon that line? Satan must have been celebrating, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t read the fineprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virgin birth avoids this curse, yet by Joseph being the legal father of Jesus, who is legally Joseph&amp;rsquo;s firstborn, Jesus has every right to assume David&amp;rsquo;s throne even though he bears no blood relationship to Jeconiah! His bloodline is through Mary, who is a descendent of David but by a different lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haman&amp;rsquo;s attempt to wipe out the Jews in exile &amp;ndash; Esther 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beast stood ready to devour the child from the MOMENT HE WAS BORN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall the peculiar circumstances of Jesus&amp;rsquo; conception and birth&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An out-of-wedlock conception was potentially a capital offense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of a Roman decree, a pregnant woman had to make a strenuous journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem &amp;ndash; this would have taken several days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herod ordered the slaughter of the babies because He was worried about a rival to his throne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A family with a newborn has to flee to Egypt and back to Nazareth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-125-6&#34;&gt;Rev 12:5-6&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;She gave birth to a male child, one who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron, but her child was caught up to God and to his throne, and the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, in which she is to be nourished for 1,260 days.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rod of Iron = Messianic Destiny&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 2:9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 2:27&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 19:15-16&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caught up = harpazo (Greek) = rapturo (Latin)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;body of Christ&amp;rdquo; was &amp;ldquo;raptured&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implied gap between verse 5 and verse 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fled into the wilderness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we pivot from our past and into our future&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many see this 3.5 year period as the 1st half of the seven year tribulation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel, the woman, is protected, just as the original Israelites were in the wilderness. While the wilderness is a place of safety, it is also a place of testing, discipline, and waiting on God&amp;rsquo;s promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-127-8&#34;&gt;Rev 12:7-8&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Now war arose in heaven, Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon. And the dragon and his angels fought back, but he was defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another scene shift &amp;ndash; we&amp;rsquo;re now back in heaven briefly for the background on how the dragon ended up on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;War in heaven is a startling verse. I thought heaven was a peaceful place where we rested on clouds and played harps? (kidding).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This war symbolizes the spiritual warfare we are in every day &amp;ndash; the cosmic battle between good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the chief princes - Dan 10:13&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Archangel - Jude 1:9; 1 Thess 4:16&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel&amp;rsquo;s prince - Dan 10:21&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warrior for Israel - Dan 12:1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fought with Satan for Body of Moses - Jude 9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fought in &amp;ldquo;Wars of the Lord&amp;rdquo; - Zech 14:3; Num 21:14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael is ALWAYS involved in a military mission to protect Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Dragon = Satan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Origin Ezek 28:2-15&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebellion in heaven - Isa 14:12-17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancient = beginning Gen 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deceives the whole world - 2 Cor 4:3,4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liar from the beginning - Gen 3:4, 5; Jn 8:44&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enmity with Man - Gen 3:14-15&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven heads, 10 horns - Rev 13:1; 17:3; cf. Dan 7, et al.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-129&#34;&gt;Rev 12:9&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world&amp;mdash;he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, Satan had authority given by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job 1:6 says he had access to heaven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter confirms this authority in 1 Pet 5:8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We infer his role was like a prosecuting attorney who went out to test the faithful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one very odd passage, 2 Chronicles 18:17-22, God permits a deceiving spirit to allow prophets in the northern kingdom to entice the King of Israel to do the wrong thing. There is nothing new under the sun including fake news. Satan is described elsewhere as a deceiver, so scholars infer that the deceiving spirit sent to the king was Satan or one of his underlings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key thought is that at some point AFTER the fall, Satan still had access to God to accuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with this reasoning, the casting out could not have happened before the Fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t really know when this occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point Satan was, or will be, permanently banished from God&amp;rsquo;s presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus said &amp;ldquo;I saw Satan fall,&amp;rdquo; he could have been using the Prophetic Past tense &amp;ndash; meaning He sees it as completed even though it may not have happened on our timeline yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s that fruitful to argue whether this banishment has or has not happened yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, Satan is a real and present threat to us today, and we must have our Armour of Guard on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek is open about whether God specifically cast them down to earth, or merely banished them from heaven, and they happened to choose Earth. Again, this is immaterial from our perspective. Either way, Satan is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hope is that Messiah is about to take over as the rightful ruler of this world. We see this in verse 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1210-11&#34;&gt;Rev 12:10-11&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, &amp;ldquo;Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come, for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God.&lt;/small&gt; &lt;small&gt;And they have conquered (overcame) him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accuser no longer can accuse us before God, but now he is going to wreak as much havoc as he can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been given the supernatural power to overcome the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not loving our lives is how we overcome. Are you willing to lay down your life instead of compromising your witness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heading-2&#34;&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1212-13&#34;&gt;Rev 12:12-13&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Therefore, rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to you, O earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you in great wrath, because he knows that his time is short!&amp;rdquo; And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heaven and earth are out of harmony with each other. Heaven is rejoicing because Satan is gone from their presence while earth is going through tribulation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woe &amp;ndash; technically we do not have a &amp;ldquo;third woe&amp;rdquo; statement like we did with the first and second woes. Some commentators see the third woe implied here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very important theological point (which we all know from experience): satan&amp;rsquo;s attacks on believing Israel (including grafted-in gentiles) and the Jewish people at large did not end at the Resurrection. They have not stopped after the horrors of the Holocaust came to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They continue and will continue until evil is defeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would Satan be so interested in non-believing Jews?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s reasonable to ask why Satan does this even though he knows he won&amp;rsquo;t be successful. How do most criminals behave when they know they have nothing to lose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flip that around. You and I have nothing to lose either if we are in Christ. If the evil sin with reckless abandon, how much more should the righteous live our lives sold out for Jesus?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heading-3&#34;&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1214&#34;&gt;Rev 12:14&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle so that she might fly from the serpent into the wilderness, to the place where she is to be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eagle: Ex 19:4, Deut 2:9-11; Ex 19:4, Deut 32:11-12; Isa 40:31;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilderness: Dan 11:41; Isa 11:16; Ezekiel 20:35-38; Hos 2:14,15; Zeph 2:3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earth Swallows enemies: Num 16:31,33; Michah 7:15&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same period of time as was mentioned earlier. Time, times and ½ a time is 1 year + 2 years + ½ year or 3.5 years, or 1260 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The period of Israel&amp;rsquo;s protection is the same as it was for the two witnesses to live and prophesy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1215&#34;&gt;Rev 12:15&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;The serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, to sweep her away with a flood.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan tries a reversal of Noah&amp;rsquo;s flood, where God wiped out the demonically corrupted humanoids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The water could be literal water, or symbolic of any destructive force of persecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When satan opens his mouth, the earth opens up its mouth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heading-4&#34;&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1216&#34;&gt;Rev 12:16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;But the earth came to the help of the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had poured from his mouth.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13-16 is a cryptic passage (given that the &amp;ldquo;earth dwellers&amp;rdquo; are the antagonists, and yet, here the earth comes to the aid of the Woman). Essentially, God wins and comes to the aid of his people, likely the Jewish believers in Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 124: A Song of Ascents. Of David. If it had not been the LORD who was on our side&amp;mdash; let Israel now say&amp;mdash; if it had not been the LORD who was on our side when people rose up against us, then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their anger was kindled against us; then the flood would have swept us away, the torrent would have gone over us; then over us would have gone the raging waters. Blessed be the LORD, who has not given us as prey to their teeth! We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowlers; the snare is broken, and we have escaped! Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heading-5&#34;&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1217&#34;&gt;Rev 12:17&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Then the dragon became furious with the woman and went off to make war on the rest of her offspring, on those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Jews are the woman&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;primary&amp;rdquo; offspring who fled to the wilderness, then a reasonable conclusion is that we believing gentiles, grafted-in to the woman, Israel, through faith in Messiah are the &amp;ldquo;rest of her offspring.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Christians believe that we aren&amp;rsquo;t subject to ANY commandments. This verse (and NUMEROUS others in the New Testament) would say otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you hold to the testimony of Jesus, you will keep his commandments &amp;ndash; anything else is a contradiction. He said &amp;ldquo;If you love me, keep my commandments.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t keep all 613 commandments, but keep those that Jesus or the other apostolic authors conferred on us (e.g., in Acts 15), plus any others we may voluntarily wish to take on as a form of discipline and as a way to draw closer to our God (not compulsory but voluntarily).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, no one person has to keep all 613 as some are applicable to Levites, some apply only if/when a Temple is in operation, some only to women, and many are viewed as not applicable if one is living outside the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should keep as many as we are called upon to keep. The number is not zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 13: 10 Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 6:2 Bear one another&amp;rsquo;s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you keeping the applicable commandments of God, not as a &amp;ldquo;got-to&amp;rdquo; but as a &amp;ldquo;get to&amp;rdquo;, in order to honor Jesus, acknowledge His lordship over your life, and to demonstrate to others that you are His ambassador?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mystery-verse&#34;&gt;Mystery verse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;And he stood on the sand of the sea.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some manuscripts have, &amp;ldquo;and I stood on the sand of the sea&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some versions have this at the end of verse 17 (ESV), some create a verse 18 (NLT &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Then the dragon took his stand on the shore beside the sea.&amp;rdquo; and others insert it at the beginning of Rev 13:1 (KJV/NKJV &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orange arrow from Gerar (box 6) towards Egypt marks the expulsion of Ishmael and Hagar into the wilderness of Beersheba&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separation was necessary to protect the son of the promise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red arrow from Beersheba to Jerusalem (box 7) denotes the path to and from the offering of Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Map credit&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-21-and-romans-galatians-and-hebrews&#34;&gt;Genesis 21 and Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An understanding of Genesis 21 is paramount to understanding Paul’s/Hebrew’s arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews and only these three New Testament books discuss Genesis 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acts references the birth of Isaac; James and Hebrews reference the sacrifice of Isaac in Genesis 22.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to read Galatians and come away that Paul was somehow anti-law or anti-Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This train of thought is deeply flawed and runs the risk of missing Paul’s points entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is focused not on Judaism as a whole, but on the Messiah-rejecting Jews who are knowingly or unknowingly continuing in legalism instead of accepting the free gift the Messiah brings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, the three books, and only these three New Testament books quote Habakkuk 2:4 (KJV) “but the just shall live by his faith.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews seem to form a trilogy on Habakkuk 2:4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme of Romans: who are the justified?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme of Galatians: how shall the justified live?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme of Hebrews: faith in the promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads many to suspect Paul is the author of Hebrews. If he did not, this is an even greater miracle, because whoever wrote Hebrews unknowingly completed the trilogy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-211-3&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:1-3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD took note of Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for Sarah as He had promised. So Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him. Abraham named his son who was born to him, the son whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:23 But the son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, and the son by the free woman through the promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:11 By faith even Sarah herself received the ability to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other translations say “God remembered Sarah.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not that God forgot, but that He remembered His promise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Appointed time” = &lt;em&gt;mo’ed.&lt;/em&gt; The Jewish festivals are Moedim. Shabbat is a moed. A moed is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Isaac was born on a festival day, just as some speculate Jesus might have been born on Yom Kippur or the first day of Tabernacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either day fits – He is our atonement and he dwells/tabernacles among us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Bible uses a miraculous birth to indicate that God has set aside that child for some great purpose.” (SOM 94)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yitzhak is related to the Hebrew verb &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;צחק&lt;/span&gt;, which means to laugh, but often carries a nuanced connotation of mocking/scorning or even sexual play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’ll unpack more at verse 9.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-214-7&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:4-7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. Now Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me.” And she said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have given birth to a son in his old age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically, in an age of high infant mortality rates, eight days, an infant was considered viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac was circumcised according to the letter of the law on the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is contrasted with Ishmael, who was circumcised at age 13; he was still circumcised, but in a typological sense, not when he “should” have been according to the Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the nuanced meaning of Tzahaq, this may not necessarily be laughing in joy, but laughing in amazement. Sarah and Abraham both laughed in disbelief and perhaps mockery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac’s birth was a true miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an overarching theme in the Bible of God miraculously opening a closed womb. This extends to Mary; although she was not barren in the traditional sense, her womb was miraculously opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God made EVERYTHING in Sarah come to life – she didn’t just give birth but was able to nurse for a couple of years after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-218-10&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:8-10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. Now Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking Isaac. Therefore she said to Abraham, “Drive out this slave woman and her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not be an heir with my son Isaac!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode becomes symbolic of the affliction of the Hebrew/Jewish people throughout the ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:29 But as at that time the son who was born according to the flesh persecuted the one who was born according to the Spirit, so it is even now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:31 So then, brothers and sisters, we are not children of a slave woman, but of the free woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to some reckonings, the 400 years of suffering and affliction culminating in the exodus from Egypt begins with this affliction of Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t have much background on any tradition of a weaning feast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know who Hagar is, but the Narrator wants us to remember her as “Hagar the Egyptian.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did Ishmael do that was so bad that he and his mother had to be driven out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s this word Tzahaq again, translated as mocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Laughter can be used for good or for ill.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:8 Now it came about, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked down through a window, and saw them, and behold, Isaac was &lt;strong&gt;caressing&lt;/strong&gt; his wife Rebekah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caressing = sporting = “Tzahaqing”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael ridiculing and poking fun at his younger brother probably wouldn’t have led to the banishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael was quite possibly a sexual predator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah refuses to speak his name. Whatever it was, it had to be bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust-along-the-talmidim-way&#34;&gt;Walking In His Dust Along The Talmidim Way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;talmidim-must-drive-out-fleshly-works-and-sin-from-our-lives&#34;&gt;Talmidim must drive out fleshly works and sin from our lives.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 5:7 Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, just as you are in fact unleavened. For Christ our Passover also has been sacrificed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another theme in the Bible is the firstborn son doing something to forfeit his inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, the firstborn son receives a double portion of the father’s estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the son does something wicked, he forfeits his promise; then the next in line receives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Ishmael but Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Esau but Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Reuben (and not Simeon or Levi) but Judah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we have an especially odd situation. Joseph was the firstborn of Jacob’s favorite wife Rebekkah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judah receives the official double portion, but Joseph also receives a double portion with Ephraim and Manaesseh being adopted by Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2111-13&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:11-13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matter distressed Abraham greatly because of his son Ishmael. But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed because of the boy and your slave woman; whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her, for through Isaac your descendants shall be named. “And of the son of the slave woman I will make a nation also, because he is your descendant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:28 And you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 9:7 nor are they all children because they are Abraham’s descendants, but: “THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS SHALL BE NAMED.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:18 it was he to whom it was said, “THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS SHALL BE NAMED.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banishment of Ishmael is Abraham’s 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see here that he was reluctant and was “distressed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He loved Ishmael.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His specific tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did he trust God to take care of him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did he trust God’s promises to make Ismael a great nation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did he trust Sarah’s judgment after the last time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial of Ishmael prepared him for the final test in Genesis 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God had previously promised a great future for Ishmael, but Isaac is the one who will inherit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s curious that the Narrator added, “whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her…”. Certainly, this was not the case in Genesis 16 or Genesis 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genesis 3:17 Then to Adam He said, “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat from it’; Cursed is the ground because of you; With hard labor you shall eat from it All the days of your life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2114-16&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:14-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Abraham got up early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water, and gave them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder, and gave her the boy, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered about in the wilderness of Beersheba. When the water in the skin was used up, she left the boy under one of the bushes. Then she went and sat down opposite him, about a bowshot away, for she said, “May I not see the boy die!” And she sat opposite him, and raised her voice and wept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:24 This is speaking allegorically, for these women are two covenants: one coming from Mount Sinai giving birth to children who are to be slaves; she is Hagar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:31 So then, brothers and sisters, we are not children of a slave woman, but of the free woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern makes an interesting comment at Galatians 4:24, “Nowhere does the account in Genesis denigrate Hagar, hense there is no reason to demean the Mosaic Law on the basis of this passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the Torah or Judaism, but people who have perverted the Torah and Judaism into a legalistic system, which is equivalent to a return to slavery in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is essentially the same territory where she wandered in chapter 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned in Israel that in Abraham’s day, towns were generally situated about a day’s journey apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He outfitted her with one day’s provisions with the expectation that she would “refuel” at the next town, perhaps Beersheba 15 miles from Gerar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, she doesn’t make it and heads into the wilderness/desert south of Beersheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did she make it but was turned away because of her “status”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could she not make it that far?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps distressed, did she meander aimlessly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2117-19&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:17-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God heard the boy crying; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What is the matter with you, Hagar? Do not fear, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. “Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him by the hand, for I will make a great nation of him.” Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another significant well moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as in chapter 16, God again sees Hagar and provides materially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also reiterates His promises that Hagar had forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well was there; she just couldn’t see it. That’s a picture of us some days. We can’t open our eyes enough to see the blessing before us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Romans and Galatians, many of us have a dim view of Hagar and Ishmael – certainly, some of this is deserved and as biblical types, they represent the things that we are supposed to reject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s remember the Bible’s worst sinners are pictures of you and me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael messed up “bigly.” We mess up too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here God reaches out and offers both Hagar and Ishmael His mercy and protection. We can be critical because it doesn’t appear that this mercy had any lasting effect. One would have hoped that they could have followed the God of Abraham. We have the same choices when God shows us mercy. How often does God bail us out or see us through a tough spot only to have us forget about God a few moments later?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust-along-the-talmidim-way-1&#34;&gt;Walking In His Dust Along The Talmidim Way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;when-things-seem-hopeless-talmidim-look-for-gods-promises&#34;&gt;When things seem hopeless, talmidim look for God’s promises.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes life hits us and we lose focus. When things seem bleak and we despair, we may need to open our eyes to the goodness of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Peter 3:14-15 But even if you should suffer for righteousness&amp;rsquo; sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2120-21&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:20-21&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God was with the boy, and he grew; and he lived in the wilderness and became an archer. He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paran is in the northeastern Sinai desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This region figures prominently in the Wilderness wanderings (specifically Numbers 13, where Kadesh-Barnea is located).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-22---abrahams-10supthsup-test-the-akedah-of-isaac&#34;&gt;Genesis 22 - Abraham’s 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; test: The Akedah of Isaac&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/gen22a.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is sacred to Jews and Christians alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jews recite the 19 verses every morning as a reminder of how we endure trials that prove our character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians rightfully see this as the beloved son “dying” and being “resurrected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer of Hebrews explains the figurative language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:17-19 By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son, [18] of whom it was said, “Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.” [19] He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac as a type of Jesus will continue in chapter 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is also incredibly troubling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn’t answer the obvious question we raise in response: how could God ask this of anyone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akedah means “binding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The binding is a foreshadowing of Matthew 27:2: And they &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;bound&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; him and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate the governor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-221&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these things, God tested Abraham and said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After what things? The previous nine tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KJV has “tempt,” which is not the best rendition of Nisah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sense is a test, like in boot camp where they push you to the limit to see what you’re made of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the word in Hebrew when Jesus quotes Deuteronomy 8 “you shall not put the Lord your God to the test.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Hebrew version of the Lord’s Prayer, the line “lead me not into tempatation” is literally, “do not bring me into the hands of a test.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God would never lead us into sinful temptation, and we should pray that we never have to be tested the way Abraham was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hineini&lt;/em&gt; – a great one-word Hebrew prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I am. Behold me. Look, me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, it is used to indicate one who is ready, willing, and able to serve God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-222-3&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:2-3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.” So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac. And he cut the wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your son:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, Isaac’s name comes last&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew sages fill in the details of the discussion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your son – but I have two sons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your only/unique son – both are the only sons of their mothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yehidcha (lit. “your unique”) gets translated into Greek and Latin (e.g., church creeds) as “only begotten.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the sense is not a numeric designation but one of status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, of course, is both numerically singular and preeminent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whom you love – I love them both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Isaac – (OH!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/gen22b.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to the land&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew is “&lt;em&gt;Lech Lecha,&lt;/em&gt;” “go forth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same command God gave Abram in Genesis 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the command for the first test is, in this respect, identical to the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call of Abram culminated in the command to sacrifice Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mount Moriah is the area of Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God later directed David and Solomon to the exact same mountain to build the temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus Isaac’s offering is linked to the Temple sacrifices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Testament writers also link Jesus to these sacrifices, so we have a three-layered connection from Isaac, to the temple sacrifices, to Jesus’ once-and-for-all sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All involve the principle that the death of a righteous one provides atonement for the sins of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rose early” means Abraham didn’t hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IF Abraham is acting with the highest possible level of faith, it could be argued that he didn’t hesitate because God promised inheritance through Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God had the problem, not Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac must be resurrected for the promise to be fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wealthy Abraham even saddled his own donkey and even though over 100, he split the wood for the sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When God gives YOU a command, don’t hesitate and don’t delegate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three temptations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that Satan appeared to Abraham three times in an attempt to circumvent what he was about to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is fascinating as the Gospels record the three temptations of Jesus, each one offering Jesus a shortcut to avoid going to the Cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on the two young men as we work through the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-224&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac was “dead” to Abraham when the command came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the third day, he was “resurrected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosea 6:2 “He will revive us after two days; He will raise us up on the third day, That we may live before Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The place” becomes a proper noun. HaMakom. Jerusalem. The Place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-225&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; I and the boy will go over there and worship and come again to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How old is Isaac?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Christians imagine Isaac as a young child, perhaps around 10 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word translated as “boy,” is &lt;em&gt;naar&lt;/em&gt;, which means young lad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na’ar usually refers to a bachelor (while technically true, we don’t generally refer to 10-year-olds as bachelors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition claims Isaac was 37, which is based on Sarah’s age at Isaac’s birth and her death at 127. This is because Jewish tradition holds that Sarah’s death (described in Chapter 23) occurred due to the command to sacrifice Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While perhaps not exactly the same age, it does appear that both Isaac and Jesus were in their 30s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is going to return to the two youths?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that in this great test of faith, Abraham would knowing lie here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s more likely that he had THAT much faith that Isaac would be resurrected somehow (See Hebrews 11:17-18).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two also serve as the legally required two witnesses. If anyone needed to verify the story, they could have asked the servants who were there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-226-7&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:6-7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together. And Isaac said to his father Abraham, “My father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” He said, “Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/gen22c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;45%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Christians, this section certainly recalls Jesus making the journey to Golgotha under the weight of His cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This way of suffering is commemorated by the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem, which leads from the Antonio Fortress on the northeast side of the city to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Historically, Jesus was probably led from Pilate’s praetorium on the southwestern side of the Old City.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-228&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham said, “God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So they went both of them together..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our tour guide said, “Hebrew is cheap with words.” meaning one word can have multiple meanings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew phrase “Yireh-lo” could mean “he will see to it” or “he will provide himself.” It’s amazing that both are true here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God himself will provide the lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God will provide Himself as the lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the word for “provide” literally means “see,” God will see for Himself the lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is in the sense that when God saw the blood of the Passover lamb on the doorposts, the death angel passed over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is also deliberately connected to the Passover Lamb of God. 1 Corinthians 5:7b For Christ our Passover also has been sacrificed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Revelation, we see the Lamb as it had been slain. Revelation 5:6 “And I saw between the throne (with the four living creatures) and the elders a Lamb standing as if slaughtered, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both as one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take note when the Holy Spirit repeats something. Abraham also says “my son” twice in three verses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may wonder how an elderly Abraham coerced the younger Isaac into doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is straightforward. He didn’t coerce Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that Isaac knew about the outcome and went to the wood willingly…just like another Son did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion of a helpless child being obliviously led to his death doesn’t fit the text, and I would argue it doesn’t fit the character of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we see Isaac as a model of Jesus, we can better understand that Isaac knew what his father asked of him and did so willingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact many read this passage and conclude “God is condoning child sacrifice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposite is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pagan religions around Abraham appeared to all practice child sacrifice; but here God says, “not me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repeated instances of “they walked on together” and “my son” indicates emphasis on Abraham and Isaac’s unity. In fact &lt;em&gt;yachdav&lt;/em&gt;, “together,” means unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-229--the-binding&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:9 – the binding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we could ask whether a 100-year-old could bind a 37-year-old man against his will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the sages then ask, if Isaac was willing, why did Abraham need to bind him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the answer is that Isaac asked to be bound, lest he flinch and somehow invalidate the sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the knife had struck a non-vital area, such as a superficial wound on the arm, the ensuing sacrifice would not be “without blemish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, it was not necessary to bind Jesus, but they did so anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all the messianic parallels in this chapter aren’t enough, the very name of the chapter in Hebrew, Akedah, comes from a root word meaning striped, referring to the stripe-like marks left by the ropes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire story is named after the marks left on Isaac’s body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 53:5 (KJV) But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stripes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; we are healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages note that Abraham didn’t build &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt; alter there; he built &lt;em&gt;THE&lt;/em&gt; altar there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This becomes the altar of the Temple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2210-12--the-resurrection&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:10-12 – the “resurrection”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son. But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” He said, “Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him, for now, I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if Abraham had said, “not now, I’m busy”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hineni!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:19 (NASB) He considered that God is able to raise people even from the dead, from which he also received him back as a type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Writer to Hebrews was quoting a well-known tradition that Isaac died (some say literally) and was resurrected on the Altar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Torah Isaac did not die but often, these traditions, though seemingly fanciful, contain greater truths and insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Hebrews quotes this indicates the legend was well-known throughout the Jewish communities, which of course spread to the gentile churches. This should not surprise us as the early church leaders were all Jewish and would have passed on this and many other Jewish teachings that tie together Old Testament events with the life, death, and resurrection of Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2213-14--the-substitute&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:13-14 – the substitute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son. So Abraham called the name of that place, “The LORD will provide”; as it is said to this day, “On the mount of the LORD it shall be provided.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Y—H Yireh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Literally, “the LORD sees”, but in the sense of “he will see to it,” i.e., “provide.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It SHALL BE provided?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like it should say “The LORD provided,” but the verb is imperfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did Abraham know that this procedure acted out the prophecy in advance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t know for sure but it seems logical that when Jesus said, “Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day. He saw it and was glad” (John 8:56), namely the multiple references to “see,” Jesus was referring to this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ram also suggests a substitutionary offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and I are in Isaac’s shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We deserve death but God provides himself (literally), just as Abraham said in verse 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that the horns from Isaac’s ram that will herald the coming of the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2215-18&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:15-18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven and said, “By myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies, and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 6:13-15 For when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear an oath by no one greater, He swore by Himself, [14] saying, “INDEED I WILL GREATLY BLESS YOU AND I WILL GREATLY MULTIPLY YOU.” [15] And so, having patiently waited, he obtained the promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:12 Therefore even from one man, and one who was as good as dead at that, there were born descendants who were just as the stars of heaven in number, and as the innumerable grains of sand along the seashore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angel of the Lord begins the conversation but the words are God’s himself, so much that there is no distinction between the angel of the LORD and the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 10:30 “I and the Father are one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham passes this greatest test and the promise of offspring is reiterated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust-along-the-talmidim-way-2&#34;&gt;Walking In His Dust Along The Talmidim Way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;talmidim-can-expect-our-faith-to-be-tested&#34;&gt;Talmidim can expect our faith to be tested&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster writes, “Real faith requires real faithfulness. Real faith results in obedience. Every time we obey God, we prove our faithfulness.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three phases of Salvation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justification phase of salvation: one-time, yielding to Jesus as our savior. He does all the work. We simply cease resisting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctification phase of salvation: everything after that until you die that proves your justification is genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glorification phase of salvation: everything after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the same way a potter does not (bother to) test defective pots, but only sound vessels, the Holy One, blessed be He, does not test the wicked but only the righteous” (Genesis Rabbah 55:2).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his famous passage containing “faith without works is dead” (James 2:17), James, the brother of Jesus, used this story of Abraham as his proof text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James 2:20-24 But are you willing to acknowledge, you foolish person, that faith without works is useless? Was our father Abraham not justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected; and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “AND ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS,” and he was called a friend of God. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2219&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham lived at Beersheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who returned to the young men?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The casual reader concludes, rather obviously, Abraham AND ISAAC came down from the mountain, rejoined the two young men and returned to Beersheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not what the text says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac will not appear again until Genesis 24:62, when he meets Rebekkah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The son is sacrificed by the father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The son is “resurrected” (according to Hebrews).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The son “disappears” until he is united with his bride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you mean to tell me…? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2220-24&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:20-24&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now after these things it was told to Abraham, “Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor: Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” (Bethuel fathered Rebekah.) These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham&amp;rsquo;s brother. Moreover, his concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;we-need-to-look-beyond&#34;&gt;We need to look beyond&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a spiritual perspective, at some level Abraham knew that the promises to make him a great nation probably would not be achieved during his earthly lifetime.  He knew that God&amp;rsquo;s promises looked beyond death into the next age.  The same is true for us!&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-covenantal-obligation&#34;&gt;A Covenantal Obligation?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many respects, the Akedah cannot be completely understood without the lends of the New Testament that clarifies Abraham and Isaac was an act of prophecy that pointed to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster includes something extraordinary from Jewish tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A covenant is a two-way street,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first party can’t ask the second to do something the first person would not do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Abraham demonstrated his willingness to offer Isaac, the ball was now in God’s court to perform and reciprocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Abraham’s willing sacrifice asked for an equal show of covenant devotion from the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sacrifice of Isaac not only foreshadowed the sacrifice of Yeshua, IT DEMANDED IT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revelation 13&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Then the dragon stood on the seashore (12:18), and I saw a &lt;strong&gt;beast&lt;/strong&gt; come up out of the sea, with &lt;strong&gt;ten horns and seven heads&lt;/strong&gt;. On its horns were ten royal crowns and, on its heads, blasphemous names. The beast which I saw was like a &lt;strong&gt;leopard&lt;/strong&gt;, but with feet like those of a &lt;strong&gt;bear&lt;/strong&gt; and a mouth like the mouth of a &lt;strong&gt;lion&lt;/strong&gt;. To it, the &lt;strong&gt;dragon&lt;/strong&gt; gave its power, its throne, and great authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the heads of the beast appeared to have received a fatal wound, but its fatal wound was healed, and the whole earth followed after the beast in amazement. They worshipped the dragon because he had given his authority to the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, &amp;ldquo;Who is like the beast? Who can fight against it?&amp;rdquo; It was given a mouth speaking arrogant blasphemies, and it was given authority to act for &lt;strong&gt;forty-two months.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it opened its mouth in blasphemies against God to insult his name and his Sh&amp;rsquo;khinah, and those living in heaven; it was allowed to make war on God&amp;rsquo;s holy people and to defeat them; and it was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation. Everyone living on earth will worship it &lt;em&gt;except those whose names are written in the Book of Life belonging to the Lamb slaughtered before the world was founded&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Those who have ears, let them hear!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If anyone is meant for captivity, into captivity he goes! If anyone is to be killed with the sword, with the sword he is to be killed!&amp;rdquo; This is when God&amp;rsquo;s holy people must persevere and trust! Then I saw &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; beast coming up out of the earth. It had two horns like those of a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon. It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence; and it makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, the one whose fatal wound had been healed. It performs great miracles, even causing fire to come down from heaven onto the earth as people watch. It deceives the people living on earth by the miracles it is allowed to perform in the presence of the beast, and it tells them to make an image honoring the beast that was struck by the sword but came alive again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was allowed to put breath into the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast could even speak; and it was allowed to cause anyone who would not worship the image of the beast to be put to death. Also, it forces everyone&amp;mdash;great and small, rich and poor, free and slave&amp;mdash;to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead preventing anyone from buying or selling unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name. This is where wisdom is needed; those who understand should count the number of the beast, for it is the number of a person, and its number is 666.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;perspective&#34;&gt;Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not anxious to know the number of the Beast, and I am thankful I will not have to live in that period. I am very thankful today that I know Jesus Christ as my Savior. Instead of spending time with Antichrist, I want to know Jesus Christ. I can say with Paul: &amp;ldquo;That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death&amp;rdquo; (Php 3:10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Vernon McGee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-131&#34;&gt;Rev 13:1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads, with ten diadems on its horns and blasphemous names on its heads.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;sea&amp;rdquo; is usually a reference to the Mediterranean Sea. Since it was gentiles who sailed upon it, the &amp;ldquo;sea&amp;rdquo; became a euphemism for the gentile nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of the middle east, Rome arose out of the Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time, we looked at Daniel 7 where Daniel also saw four beasts out of the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beast #1 &amp;ndash; (Dan 7:4) &amp;ndash; Lion (presumed to be Babylon) &amp;ndash; 1 head and 0 horns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beast #2 &amp;ndash; (Dan 7:5) Bear (Medio-Persia) &amp;ndash; 1 head and 0 horns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beast #3 &amp;ndash; (Dan 7:6) Leopard (Greek) &amp;ndash; 4 heads and 0 horns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beast #4 &amp;ndash; (Dan 7:7) Dreadful (Rome) &amp;ndash; 1 head and 10 horns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total: 7 heads and 10 horns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horns?: Julius Caesar, Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, (Galba, Otho, Vitellius), Vespesian (11^th^, little horn might be Domitian)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan 7:8  I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them &lt;strong&gt;another horn, a little one&lt;/strong&gt;, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blasphemous names could refer to the fact that the Roman Emperors demanded to be worshipped as gods, as we talked about when we went through the 7 letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we say often, these horns are not named so we are just speculating as to what the 1st-century audience&amp;rsquo;s interpretation might have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have more clues in Revelation 17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; Rev 17:9-13  This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated; they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he does come he must remain only a little while. As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven, and it goes to destruction. And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power, but they are to receive authority as kings for one hour, together with the beast. These are of one mind, and they hand over their power and authority to the beast. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rome is called the city that sits on seven hills&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geographically, the territory all these empires have in common is the middle east, not Europe (in fact, only Rome held Europe as we think of it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we hear &amp;ldquo;revived Roman Empire,&amp;rdquo; many protestant scholars are looking to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could just as easily be somewhere in the eastern part of the Roman Empire, which included the ancient empires of Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God pronounces woes and judgments against all these lands through the prophets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Isaiah 10:5 says, &amp;ldquo;Woe to the Assyrian, the rod of my anger; the staff in their hands is my fury!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; because of this, some speculate that the Antichrist will come from the lands of the ancient Assyrian empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to re-read Daniel 7 in full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Revelation 12:3, the dragon had 7 heads, 10 horns and &lt;strong&gt;7 diadems on its heads&lt;/strong&gt;. Here the Beast from the sea has 7 heads, 10 horns, but &lt;strong&gt;10 diadems on its horns&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be related to Revelation 17 &amp;ldquo;And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power, but they are to receive authority as kings for one hour, together with the beast. These are of one mind, and they hand over their power and authority to the beast.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-132&#34;&gt;Rev 13:2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;And the beast that I saw was like a leopard; its feet were like a bear&amp;rsquo;s, and its mouth was like a lion&amp;rsquo;s mouth. And to it the dragon gave his power and his throne and great authority.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we noted last time, John&amp;rsquo;s beast is a mixture of all four beasts from Daniel 7: the lion/Babylon, the bear/Persia, the leopard/Greece, and the beast that was so hideous as to defy description which is thought to represent Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one beast that Daniel saw had 7 heads and 10 horns, but if we add them all together, collectively they had 7 heads and 10 horns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple explanation is what Daniel saw as four distinct beasts was spiritually the same beast with different characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-133-4&#34;&gt;Rev 13:3-4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;One of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal wound was healed, and the whole earth marveled as they followed the beast. And they worshiped the dragon, for he had given his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, &amp;ldquo;Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nero was the false messiah who waged war against the believers in the days of the apostles. He was the beast who sent the Roman legions to attack Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Christian authors associated Nero with the Anti-christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He committed suicide under somewhat mysterious circumstances &amp;ndash; like Elvis, there were rumors that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t really dead. This included &amp;ldquo;sightings&amp;rdquo; of Nero, and one person claiming to be resurrected Nero even formed a small army.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an expectation in the first century of either a literal or symbolic &amp;ldquo;second-Nero.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, John would not have believed in a literal return of Nero; but, is speaking of one coming in the spirit of Nero. In fact, the next coming world leader would be far worse than Nero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that day, Domitian would have been a fit. Of all the emperors, he took worshipping his image very seriously. People had to address him as &amp;ldquo;my lord and my god, Domitian.&amp;rdquo; The pseudoresurrection, mocks the true Resurrection of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Domitian was the beast, then the Dragon would be the satanic Imperial Cult, i.e. the religious system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who is like the beast?&amp;rdquo; is a mockery of Exodus 15:11 &amp;ldquo;Who is like you, O LORD, among the gods? Who is like you, majestic in holiness, awesome in glorious deeds, doing wonders?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also Isa 46:5: &amp;ldquo;Listen to me, O house of Jacob, all the remnant of the house of Israel, who have been borne by me from before your birth, carried from the womb; even to your old age I am he, and to gray hairs I will carry you. I have made, and I will bear; I will carry and will save. &amp;ldquo;To whom will you liken me and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be alike?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agrippa the II was the governor over Judea in the years leading up to the first Jewish revolt. In trying to dissuade the people, he once went through a list of people who had tried and failed to fight against Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-135&#34;&gt;Rev 13:5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;And the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.5 years again; 1260 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pride was Satan&amp;rsquo;s problem. Isaiah 14:13-15 - You said in your heart, &amp;lsquo;I will ascend to heaven; above the stars of God I will set my throne on high; I will sit on the mount of assembly in the far reaches of the north; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.&amp;rsquo; But you are brought down to Sheol, to the far reaches of the pit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some sense this is allegorical, the beast&amp;rsquo;s system has been in place for over 2000 years (since the man child was &amp;ldquo;caught up to heaven&amp;rdquo; in Revelation 12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messiah should have been back by now, but the redemption is delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler likens it to a chess clock &amp;ndash; our clock is paused while our opponent is making his move. Soon it will be time for God to make His move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words but a literal 1260 days AND symbolic &amp;ldquo;a long time&amp;rdquo; could be in view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-136&#34;&gt;Rev 13:6&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name and his dwelling, that is, those who dwell in heaven.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel&amp;rsquo;s prophecies speak constantly of the little horn who speaks boastful things. One of the names for the Anti-christ could aptly be, &amp;ldquo;Mr. Bigmouth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We mentioned in a previous lesson how the enemies of God have a peculiar fascination with desecrating the Jewish temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, our bodies are referred to as the &amp;ldquo;temple of God&amp;rdquo; because God&amp;rsquo;s spirit shekinah&amp;rsquo;s (dwells) within us just as He did in the Jewish temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In heaven, we will inhabit the heavenly temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-137-8&#34;&gt;Rev 13:7-8&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Also it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them. And authority was given it over every tribe and people and language and nation, and all who dwell on earth will worship it, everyone whose name has not been written before the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to Daniel 7: &amp;ldquo;The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which will be different from all kingdoms. It will devour the whole earth, tread it down and break it into pieces. The ten horns are ten kings who will arise out of this kingdom, and another king will arise after them, and he will be different from the former ones, and he will subdue three kings. He will speak great words against the Most High, he will wear out the holy people of the Most High, and he will think to change times and laws; and they will be given into his hand for a season, seasons and half a season. But they will sit in judgment, and his dominion will be taken away, to be consumed and destroyed in the end. And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the people of the holy ones of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions will serve and obey him. Here is the end of the matter.&amp;rdquo; (Dan 7:23-27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antiochus Epiphanes 168-164 BCE was an excellent candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Jesus points us to Antiochus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 24:15  &amp;ldquo;So when you see the &lt;strong&gt;abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel&lt;/strong&gt;, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand)&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antiochus committed the abomination of desolation (he offered a pig in the Holy of Holies, and changed the laws to make it illegal to be Jewish).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, history records that the Temple lay desolate for 3.5 years, until the Maccabean revolt, celebrated at Hanukkah to this day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Jesus said &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;when you see&lt;/strong&gt; the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; meaning that the abomination Jesus is talking about was STILL FUTURE, we know we must expect a repeat of Antiochus, only far worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many commentators see the &amp;ldquo;mortal wound&amp;rdquo; as meaning an empire once thought to be dead comes back to life. Indeed, in the Hebrew Bible, a horn often denotes a powerful ruler or king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Egyptian, Babylonian, Persian and Greek empires all had relatively clear endings, usually in the form of a military defeat at the hands of the next empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rome did not &amp;ndash; it is generally considered to have imploded from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we studied in the 7 letters section, Constantine began the transition from Paganism to Christianity and the Roman empire essentially morphed into what we know as the Byzantine empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The western branch of this eventually moved back to Rome and became what we know as the Catholic church. Various nations in Europe took their turn at dominance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any of these could be said to be subtle continuations of the Roman Empire, including America, which is a branch from Britain, once the northwestern corner of the old Roman Empire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was what is called the great schism between the eastern and western churches in 1054. Our history books focus on Europe, but the Roman empire also extended east into most of what today we call the middle east. There is a long tradition of Orthodox Christianity in Turkey and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-139&#34;&gt;Rev 13:9&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;If anyone has an ear, let him hear:&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus&amp;rsquo; signature phrase if ever there was one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1310&#34;&gt;Rev 13:10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;If anyone is to be taken captive, to captivity he goes; if anyone is to be slain with the sword, with the sword must he be slain. Here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah 15:2 And when they ask you, &amp;lsquo;Where shall we go?&amp;rsquo; you shall say to them, &amp;lsquo;Thus says the LORD: &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Those who are for pestilence, to pestilence, and those who are for the sword, to the sword; those who are for famine, to famine, and those who are for captivity, to captivity.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah 43:11 He shall come and strike the land of Egypt, giving over to the pestilence those who are doomed to the pestilence, to captivity those who are doomed to captivity, and to the sword those who are doomed to the sword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a difference of opinion here. Is Jesus (the angel) talking about the saints being slain or taken captive, or is He possibly saying the wicked people doing all the things in verses 6-8 &amp;ldquo;will get theirs&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, this is a direct reference for the first-century believers to hold fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if speaking of the Believers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domitian had the authority to take captive and exile (as with John), and put to death (as with the believers at Smyrna).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is better to be exiled or martyred than to renounce the name of Yeshua and worship the beast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If speaking of the nations (it is possible to read it this way), God is saying &amp;ldquo;although things seem bad, hold fast. I&amp;rsquo;ll take care of things.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The commentator&amp;rsquo;s reason for thinking this is elsewhere in Revelation, &amp;ldquo;he who has an ear&amp;rdquo; always accompanies a promise to the overcomer; so therefore this could be a promise to the overcomer and not a warning that bad things are coming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-second-beastfalse-prophet&#34;&gt;The second beast/false prophet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1311-12&#34;&gt;Rev 13:11-12&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Then I saw another beast rising out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb, and it spoke like a dragon. It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence, and makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose mortal wound was healed.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan 8:3 I raised my eyes and saw, and behold, a ram standing on the bank of the canal. It had two horns, and both horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition has Leviathan as a mythical beast of the sea (mentioned in Job, Psalms and Isaiah), and Behemot (Job 40:15) as a mythical beast of the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the description, many people call this the satanic holy spirit. It is equal in power to the first beast, but it directs worshippers to the first beast instead of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In God&amp;rsquo;s plan, the Holy Spirit is equal in power to the Son but the Spirit&amp;rsquo;s job is to lead people to the Son. It never speaks of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of &amp;ldquo;2^nd^ beast&amp;rdquo; many commentators will say &amp;ldquo;the beast and the false prophet&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; the beast comes from the sea and the false prophet comes from the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This terminology comes from Jesus: Mat 7:15 &amp;ldquo;Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep&amp;rsquo;s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first beast exercises all authority of the dragon, while this guy exercises all authority of the first beast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While parts of this could apply to Domitian, Revelation 17-18 make it clear that this is primarily yet future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1313&#34;&gt;Rev 13:13&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;It performs great signs, even making fire come down from heaven to earth in front of people,&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Ki 18:38 Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. Just as Elijah who calls down fire, points to the true messiah, this false prophet points to the false messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems similar to the magicians of Pharoah matching the ability of Moses to produce the initial plagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1314&#34;&gt;Rev 13:14&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;and by the signs that it is allowed to work in the presence of the beast it &lt;strong&gt;deceives&lt;/strong&gt; those who dwell on earth, telling them to make an image for the beast that was wounded by the sword and yet lived.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the first beast was &amp;ldquo;mortally&amp;rdquo; wounded yet lived is called out repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark 13:21-23 And then if anyone says to you, &amp;lsquo;Look, here is the Christ!&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Look, there he is!&amp;rsquo; do not believe it. For false christs and &lt;strong&gt;false prophets&lt;/strong&gt; will arise and perform signs and wonders, to lead astray, if possible, the elect. But be on guard; I have told you all things beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and &lt;strong&gt;false signs and wonders,&lt;/strong&gt; and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false, in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didache 16:3 For in the last days, &lt;strong&gt;false prophets and seducers&lt;/strong&gt; shall be multiplied, and the sheep shall be turned into wolves, and love shall be turned into hate; and because iniquity aboundeth they shall hate each other, and persecute each other, and deliver each other up; and then shall the Deceiver of the world appear as the Son of God, and shall do signs and wonders, and the earth shall be delivered into his hands; and he shall do unlawful things, such as have never happened since the beginning of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Didache is a late 1st-century work attributed to the apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Acts 15 contains the basic requirements for gentiles coming to faith in the Jewish Messiah, the Didache has been described as a document that maturing gentile disciples followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guy won&amp;rsquo;t be repulsive; he will be alluring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1315&#34;&gt;Rev 13:15&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;15 And it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast might even speak and might cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be slain.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Dan 3:1-7 King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits and its breadth six cubits. He set it up on the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent to gather the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces gathered for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. And they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. And the herald proclaimed aloud, &amp;ldquo;You are commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages, that when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. And whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace.&amp;rdquo; Therefore, as soon as all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, all the peoples, nations, and languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally inanimate objects &amp;ldquo;coming to life&amp;rdquo; was common in ancient worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was happening in the days of the apostles. We mentioned when we talked about Pergamum how the priests at the aescalepion would shout down holes so customers would &amp;ldquo;hear from the gods&amp;rdquo; as they are hallucinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars believe that the pools of Bethesda in John 5 and the &amp;ldquo;stirring of the waters&amp;rdquo; was caused by similar priests behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image in Revelation will similarly &amp;ldquo;come to life&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1316&#34;&gt;Rev 13:16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;16 Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead,&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like branding you would put on cattle or a slave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stands in contrast to the sealing of the 144,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stands in contrast to Deuteronomy 6:4-9 - &lt;small&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one. You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. &lt;strong&gt;You shall bind them as a sign on your hand,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.&lt;/strong&gt; You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan is unoriginal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1317&#34;&gt;Rev 13:17&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;17 so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; the number of its name.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 70s barcodes were the mark of the beast, then it was biometrics, then more recently the mark is a microchip/RFID &amp;ndash; smaller than a grain of rice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, none of these would have been in view in the first century (not to say that the mark can&amp;rsquo;t use modern technology).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can draw many comparisons, especially recently when folks who did not consent to take a certain medication live under the threat of becoming second-class citizens and from being excluded from buying and selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike people who may have been duped into taking an untested, perhaps fraudulently presented medication to &amp;ldquo;stop the spread of a pandemic&amp;rdquo; with a 99.99% survival rate, &lt;strong&gt;most commentators seem to agree that it will be impossible to take the mark of the beast unknowingly&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, just like the people in the first century had to consciously renounce Jesus and swear an oath to the roman gods, so it will be with those who make a conscious decision to take the mark of the beast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1318&#34;&gt;Rev 13:18&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;18 This calls for wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason Revelation is written in code is to help avoid Roman censors. We talked about how being a believer (Jewish or gentile) was illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re challenged to &amp;ldquo;figure it out&amp;rdquo; which tells us that the number is not LITERALLY &amp;ldquo;666&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s symbolic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In first-century gematria, each letter had a numerical value. This is true of both Hebrew and Greek. If you add up the numerical values of the letters you get a number. Words that have the same value are thought to be related. This sounds hokey, but both the old and new testaments dabble in this from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, the title Nero Caesar (when you transliterate the Greek into Hebrew) added up to 666. When you transliterate into Latin, Nero Caesar adds up to 616, which is why some variants such as Iraneus, cite 616.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener cautions that much of John&amp;rsquo;s audience would not have spoken Hebrew; however, he entertains the possibility that John may have used this &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; previously (if so, it would have been known by everyone without needing to explain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are &lt;em&gt;intentionally&lt;/em&gt; not going down various rabbit trails on the 666 because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;rsquo;t looking for Antichrist,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for Jesus Christ!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;video&#34;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XHqkno8Q7Rk&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;revelation-14&#34;&gt;Revelation 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Then I looked, and there was the Lamb standing on Mount Tziyon; and with him were 144,000 who had his name and his Father&amp;rsquo;s name written on their foreheads. I heard a sound from heaven like the sound of rushing waters and like the sound of pealing thunder; the sound I heard was also like that of harpists playing on their harps. They were singing a new song before the throne and before the four living beings and the elders, and no one could learn the song except the 144,000 who have been ransomed from the world. These are the ones who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins; they follow the Lamb wherever he goes; they have been ransomed from among humanity as firstfruits for God and the Lamb; on their lips no lie was found&amp;mdash;they are without defect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven with everlasting Good News to proclaim to those living on the earth&amp;mdash;to every nation, tribe, language, and people. In a loud voice, he said, &amp;ldquo;Fear God, give Him glory, for the hour has come when he will pass judgment! Worship the One who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water!&amp;rdquo; Another angel, a second one, followed, saying, &amp;ldquo;She has fallen! She has fallen! Bavel (Babylon) the Great! She made all the nations drink the wine of God&amp;rsquo;s fury caused by her whoring!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another angel, a third one, followed them and said in a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives the mark on his forehead or on his hand, he will indeed drink the wine of God&amp;rsquo;s fury poured undiluted into the cup of his rage. He will be tormented by fire and sulfur before the holy angels and before the Lamb, and the smoke from their tormenting goes up forever and ever. They have no rest, day or night, those who worship the beast and its image and those who receive the mark of its name.&amp;rdquo; This is when perseverance is needed on the part of God&amp;rsquo;s people, those who observe his commands and exercise Yeshua&amp;rsquo;s faithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I heard a voice from heaven saying, &amp;ldquo;Write: &amp;lsquo;How blessed are the dead who die united with the Lord, from now on!&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Yes,&amp;rsquo; says the Spirit, &amp;rsquo;now they may rest from their efforts, for the things they have accomplished follow along with them.&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; Then I looked, and there before me was a white cloud. Sitting on the cloud was someone like a Son of Man with a gold crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. Another angel came out of the Temple and shouted to the one sitting on the cloud, &amp;ldquo;Start using your sickle to reap, because the time to reap has come&amp;mdash;the earth&amp;rsquo;s harvest is ripe!&amp;rdquo; The one sitting on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested. Another angel came out of the Temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then out from the altar went yet another angel, who was in charge of the fire; and he called in a loud voice to the one with the sharp sickle, &amp;ldquo;Use your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of grapes from the earth&amp;rsquo;s vine, because they are ripe!&amp;rdquo; The angel swung his sickle down onto the earth, gathered the earth&amp;rsquo;s grapes, and threw them into the great winepress of God&amp;rsquo;s fury. The winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood flowed from the winepress as high as the horses&amp;rsquo; bridles for two hundred miles!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lesson-introduction&#34;&gt;Lesson Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These chapters stand In opposition/juxtaposition to the mark of the beast, where the followers chanted, &amp;ldquo;who is like the beast?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to flash forward to the end to give the readers justification to hold fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5th, 6th, and 7th angels call for a grape harvest and we will see that God&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;winepress&amp;rdquo; features prominently in chapter 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14:1 - 15:4 appears to describe the same events that occur in Revelation 19:11-21&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war. His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems, and he has a name written that no one knows but himself. He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is The Word of God. And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, were following him on white horses. From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords. Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he called to all the birds that fly directly overhead, &amp;ldquo;Come, gather for the great supper of God, to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, both small and great.&amp;rdquo; And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against him who was sitting on the horse and against his army. And the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who in its presence had done the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur. And the rest were slain by the sword that came from the mouth of him who was sitting on the horse, and all the birds were gorged with their flesh.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-141&#34;&gt;Rev 14:1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;1 Then I looked, and there was the Lamb standing on Mount Tziyon, and with him were 144,000 who had his name and his Father&amp;rsquo;s name written on their foreheads.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were marked in Revelation 7 (and we previewed Revelation 14 when we studied Revelation 7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 2:6 &amp;ldquo;I have set up My king upon Zion, My holy mountain.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I looked and beheld&amp;rdquo; indicates a separate vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/image1.png&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mt. Zion&amp;rdquo; is associated with Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, in the time of David, Mt. Zion was associated with the eastern hill (between Tyropeon and Kidron valleys).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the time of the Apostles, it was the Temple mount (Mount Moriah on the map).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Mt. Zion refers to the western hill, but by extension it can refer to all of Jerusalem, or even the nation of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israeli national anthem mentions &amp;ldquo;Zion&amp;rdquo; twice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An eye gazes toward Zion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be a free nation in our land, the Land of Zion, Jerusalem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians deemphasize Jerusalem but we can see she features prominently in Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note seven chapters later, it is still 144,000, not 143,999. None are missing. They are sealed, protected, and ready to do battle for the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-142-3&#34;&gt;Rev 14:2-3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;2 I heard a sound from heaven like the sound of rushing waters and like the sound of pealing thunder; the sound I heard was also like that of harpists playing on their harps. 3 They were singing a new song before the throne and before the four living beings and the elders, and no one could learn the song except the 144,000 who have been ransomed from the world. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezek 1:24 - When they moved, I could hear the sound of their wings like the sound of rushing waters, like the voice of &lt;em&gt;Shaddai&lt;/em&gt;, a noise of tumult like the noise of an army. Whenever they stood still, they let down their wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezek 43:2 - and behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east. His voice was like the sound of many waters. The earth was radiant with His glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are probably singing a special remix of Psalm 96&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh sing to the LORD a new song; sing to the LORD, all the earth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sing to the LORD, bless his name; tell of his salvation from day to day. Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples! For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; he is to be feared above all gods. For all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols, but the LORD made the heavens. Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the new song but it tells us to sing the new song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a song of redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-144-5&#34;&gt;Rev 14:4-5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;4 These are the ones who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins; they follow the Lamb wherever he goes; they have been ransomed from among humanity as firstfruits for God and the Lamb; 5 on their lips no lie was found&amp;mdash;they are without defect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We looked at this when we studied Chapter 7. These 12,000 from each tribe represent the standard of purity for those going to war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, &lt;em&gt;potentially,&lt;/em&gt; they are a representative sample of firstfruits from all of the tribes, just as the number of fighting men was only a portion of the entire tribe (those for whom they fought).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the immediate context, &amp;ldquo;no lie&amp;rdquo; refers to pure theological doctrine (not that they were sinless)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same standard Jesus critiqued or commended in the seven letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He expects the same of us as believers &amp;ndash; there is to be no compromise with the world or false religious systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a salvation perspective, we are without fault or blemish because we follow the Lamb who makes us clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeph 3:13 those who are left in Israel; they shall do no injustice and speak no lies, nor shall there be found in their mouth a deceitful tongue. For they shall graze and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mal 2:6 True instruction was in his mouth, and no wrong was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were not taken in by &amp;ldquo;the lie&amp;rdquo;: 2 Th 2:11-12 Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false, in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-146&#34;&gt;Rev 14:6&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;6 Next I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven with everlasting Good News (or &amp;ldquo;eternal gospel&amp;rdquo;) to proclaim to those living on the earth&amp;mdash;to every nation, tribe, language, and people.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler counts seven angels in this chapter (verses 6, 8, 10, 13 (a voice), 15, 17, and 19. These are possibly the seven angels who will pour out the bowls in Chapter 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good news message that never gets old: &amp;ldquo;repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,&amp;rdquo; only in different words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is in contrast to &amp;ldquo;other Gospels&amp;rdquo; such as those mentioned in Galatians 1:6-9: I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel&amp;mdash; not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think the earth-dwellers will be receptive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-147&#34;&gt;Rev 14:7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;7 In a loud voice he said, &amp;ldquo;Fear God, give Him glory, for the hour has come when he will pass judgment! Worship the One who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water!&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gentile believers in the Jewish God were known as &amp;ldquo;God-fearers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectively, this passage means the same to a gentile as &amp;ldquo;Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand&amp;rdquo; does for a Jew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repent = fear god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telling a pagan to repent would be lost on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You mean you want me to return to following my false gods?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Kingdom of Heaven = Worship the One who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gentiles need elaboration on God as the creator and redeemer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is at hand = the hour has come when he will pass judgment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time is now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also fits with Psalm 96: Sing to the LORD, bless his name; tell of his salvation from day to day. Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples! For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; he is to be feared above all gods. For all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols, but the LORD made the heavens. Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-148&#34;&gt;Rev 14:8&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;8 Another angel, a second one, followed, saying, &amp;ldquo;She has fallen! She has fallen! Bavel the Great! She made all the nations drink the wine of God&amp;rsquo;s fury caused by her whoring!&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First mention of Babylon in Revelation &amp;ndash; Babylon is the literal and figurative headquarters of Satan from the beginning. The Tower of Babel was one of man&amp;rsquo;s rebellions against God. It had a satanic beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the contrast between this and &amp;ldquo;who can stand against the beast?&amp;rdquo; The angel is smack-talking here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 21:9 And behold, here come riders, horsemen in pairs!&amp;rdquo; And he answered, &amp;ldquo;Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the carved images of her gods he has shattered to the ground.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jer 51:7-8 Babylon was a golden cup in the LORD&amp;rsquo;s hand, making all the earth drunken; the nations drank of her wine; therefore the nations went mad. Suddenly Babylon has fallen and been broken; wail for her! Take balm for her pain; perhaps she may be healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now would be a good time to read three pairs of chapters on Babylon: Isaiah 13/14, Jeremiah 50/51, and Revelation 17/18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babylon had its beginning with Nimrod Genesis 10:8-10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He was a mighty hunter &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; the Lord.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; 10:9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word for &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; is לפני, literally &amp;ldquo;in the face of.&amp;rdquo; It is usually a neutral preposition indicating one&amp;rsquo;s position relative to another; but it can have a negative connotation. Like we would say &amp;ldquo;getting in someone&amp;rsquo;s face&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus several commentators believe this should be interpreted as, &amp;ldquo;Nimrod was mighty in DEFIANCE of the Lord.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The beginning of his kingdom was Babel&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tower of Babel: Genesis 11:1-9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-149-10&#34;&gt;Rev 14:9-10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;9 Another angel, a third one, followed them and said in a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives the mark on his forehead or on his hand, 10 he will indeed drink the wine of God&amp;rsquo;s fury poured undiluted into the cup of his rage. He will be tormented by fire and sulfur before the holy angels and before the Lamb,&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cup of wrath&amp;rdquo; is a frequent idiom in the Hebrew Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalms, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Habakkuk and Zechariah all contain proclamations of judgment against unbelieving gentile nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ps 75:8 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup with foaming wine, well mixed, and he pours out from it, and all the wicked of the earth shall drain it down to the dregs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 51:17 &amp;ldquo;Listen to me, you who know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear not the reproach of man, nor be dismayed at their revilings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jer 25:15-17 Thus the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me: &amp;ldquo;Take from my hand this cup of the wine of wrath, and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it. [16] They shall drink and stagger and be crazed because of the sword that I am sending among them.&amp;rdquo; [17] So I took the cup from the LORD&amp;rsquo;s hand, and made all the nations to whom the LORD sent me drink it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen 19:24 Then the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the LORD out of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wine in that day was thick and it had to be diluted &amp;ndash; God&amp;rsquo;s wrath will not be diluted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezek 38:22 With pestilence and bloodshed I will enter into judgment with him, and I will rain upon him and his hordes and the many peoples who are with him torrential rains and hailstones, fire and sulfur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1411&#34;&gt;Rev 14:11&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;11 and the smoke from their tormenting goes up forever and ever. They have no rest, day or night, those who worship the beast and its image and those who receive the mark of its name.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoke is a possible reference to the destruction of Sodom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 34:10 And the streams of Edom shall be turned into pitch, and her soil into sulfur; her land shall become burning pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be very tempting to take the mark, but don&amp;rsquo;t do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were people who took the covid jab, not because they believed it was good for their health, but because they didn&amp;rsquo;t want to deal with the threat of losing their job or worse, simply didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be bothered with the restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the mark of the best for these reasons will be a bad move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be no &amp;ldquo;God knows my heart isn&amp;rsquo;t in it&amp;rdquo; excuse (apparently).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in fairness, many in the congregations in Turkey probably had at one time offered a sacrifice to Caesar, and several in Laodicea probably were doing so presently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God will never turn away one who is truly repentant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is likely that one who swears allegiance to the beast will never have a repentant heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1412&#34;&gt;Rev 14:12&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;12 This is when perseverance is needed on the part of God&amp;rsquo;s people, those who observe his commands and exercise Yeshua&amp;rsquo;s faithfulness.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The believers are encouraged, and they will receive a special blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salvation is not complete without vindication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1413&#34;&gt;Rev 14:13&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;13 Next I heard a voice from heaven saying, &amp;ldquo;Write: &amp;lsquo;How blessed are the dead who die united with the Lord, from now on!&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Yes,&amp;rsquo; says the Spirit, &amp;rsquo;now they may rest from their efforts, for the things they have accomplished follow along with them.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our earthly view is that death is bad and when things are going bad, God must be judging us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heavenly view is that martyrdom might be what earns a believer the coveted, &amp;ldquo;well done, good and faithful servant&amp;rdquo; commendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1414&#34;&gt;Rev 14:14&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;14 Then I looked, and there before me was a white cloud. Sitting on the cloud was someone like a Son of Man with a gold crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan 7:13-14 &amp;ldquo;I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably not the Messiah because in verse 1, Jesus is standing on Mount Zion,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to remember that the concept of &amp;ldquo;time&amp;rdquo; is relative with these visions, so it could be Jesus at a different moment in time from our vantagepoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1415&#34;&gt;Rev 14:15&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;15 Another angel came out of the Temple and shouted to the one sitting on the cloud, &amp;ldquo;Start using your sickle to reap, because the time to reap has come&amp;mdash;the earth&amp;rsquo;s harvest is ripe!&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angel of the Son of Man:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is potentially the completion of the separation of the wheat and the tares in Matthew 13:24:30, 36-43.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 13:37-43: He answered, &amp;ldquo;The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man. The field is the world, and the good seed is the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one, and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels. Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of the age. The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers, and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1416-17&#34;&gt;Rev 14:16-17&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;16 The one sitting on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested. 17 Another angel came out of the Temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sickle implies grain harvest. The remainder of the chapter focuses on a grape harvest. Our antennae should go up whenever the Bible mentions bread and wine together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joel 3:13-14 Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Go in, tread, for the winepress is full. The vats overflow, for their evil is great. [14] Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full passage Joel 3:9-17 Proclaim this among the nations: Consecrate for war; stir up the mighty men. Let all the men of war draw near; let them come up. Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears; let the weak say, &amp;ldquo;I am a warrior.&amp;rdquo; Hasten and come, all you surrounding nations, and gather yourselves there. Bring down your warriors, O LORD. Let the nations stir themselves up and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat; for there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations. Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Go in, tread, for the winepress is full. The vats overflow, for their evil is great. Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision. The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining. The LORD roars from Zion, and utters his voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth quake. But the LORD is a refuge to his people, a stronghold to the people of Israel. &amp;ldquo;So you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who dwells in Zion, my holy mountain. And Jerusalem shall be holy, and strangers shall never again pass through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1418-19&#34;&gt;Rev 14:18-19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;18 Then out from the altar went yet another angel, who was in charge of the fire; and he called in a loud voice to the one with the sharp sickle, &amp;ldquo;Use your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of grapes from the earth&amp;rsquo;s vine, because they are ripe!&amp;rdquo; 19 The angel swung his sickle down onto the earth, gathered the earth&amp;rsquo;s grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God&amp;rsquo;s fury.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not literal wine. Crushed red grapes look like human blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 19:15 From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jer 25:30 &amp;ldquo;You, therefore, shall prophesy against them all these words, and say to them: &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;The LORD will roar from on high, and from his holy habitation utter his voice; he will roar mightily against his fold, and shout, like those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1420&#34;&gt;Rev 14:20&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;20 The winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood flowed from the winepress as high as the horses&amp;rsquo; bridles for two hundred miles!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 63:1-6: Who is this who comes from Edom, in crimsoned garments from Bozrah, he who is splendid in his apparel, marching in the greatness of his strength? &amp;ldquo;It is I, speaking in righteousness, mighty to save.&amp;rdquo; Why is your apparel red, and your garments like his who treads in the winepress? &amp;ldquo;I have trodden the winepress alone, and from the peoples no one was with me; I trod them in my anger and trampled them in my wrath; their lifeblood spattered on my garments, and stained all my apparel. For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and my year of redemption had come. I looked, but there was no one to help; I was appalled, but there was no one to uphold; so my own arm brought me salvation, and my wrath upheld me. I trampled down the peoples in my anger; I made them drunk in my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a deluge of blood &amp;ndash; apocalyptic literature does not require it to literally be 5&amp;rsquo; x 200 miles, but neither does it rule it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 200 mile radius would cover almost all of the modern state of Israel and much of Jordan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-15&#34;&gt;Chapter 15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 15 continues the look forward to the conclusion of events described in Chapter 19:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Then I saw another sign in heaven, a great and wonderful one&amp;mdash;seven angels with the seven plagues that are the final ones; because with them, God&amp;rsquo;s fury is finished. I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire. Those defeating the beast, its image, and the number of its name were standing by the sea of glass, holding harps that God had given them. They were singing the song of Moshe, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb: &amp;ldquo;Great and wonderful are the things you have done, Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies! Just and true are your ways, king of the nations! Adonai, who will not fear and glorify your name? because you alone are holy. All nations will come and worship before you, for your righteous deeds have been revealed.&amp;rdquo; After this I looked, and the sanctuary (that is, the Tent of Witness in heaven) was opened, and out of the sanctuary came the seven angels with the seven plagues. They were dressed in clean bright linen and had gold belts around their chests. One of the four living beings gave to the seven angels seven gold bowls filled with the fury of God, who lives forever and ever. Then the sanctuary was filled with smoke from God&amp;rsquo;s Sh&amp;rsquo;khinah, that is, from his power; and no one could enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels had accomplished their purpose. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-151-2&#34;&gt;Rev 15:1-2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and amazing, seven angels with seven plagues, which are the last, for with them the wrath of God is finished. 2 And I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mingled with fire&amp;mdash;and also those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name, standing beside the sea of glass with harps of God in their hands.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The saints are celebrating their vindication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-153-4&#34;&gt;Rev 15:3-4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, &amp;ldquo;Great and amazing are your deeds, O Lord God the Almighty! Just and true are your ways, O King of the nations! 4 Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify your name? For you alone are holy. All nations will come and worship you, for your righteous acts have been revealed.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is in contrast to chapter 13&amp;rsquo;s, &amp;ldquo;who is like the beast?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It recalls the &amp;ldquo;song of the Sea&amp;rdquo; in Exodus 15&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex 15:1-4: &amp;ldquo;Then Moses and the people of Israel sang this song to the LORD, saying, &amp;ldquo;I will sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea. The LORD is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation; this is my God, and I will praise him, my father&amp;rsquo;s God, and I will exalt him. The LORD is a man of war; the LORD is his name. &amp;ldquo;Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s chariots and his host he cast into the sea, and his chosen officers were sunk in the Red Sea.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex 15:11: &amp;ldquo;Who is like you, O LORD, among the gods? Who is like you, majestic in holiness, awesome in glorious deeds, doing wonders?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fulfillment of Psalms 86:9-10 &amp;ndash; a remnant of the nations will turn to God: &amp;ldquo;9 All the nations you have made shall come and worship before you, O Lord, and shall glorify your name. 10 For you are great and do wondrous things; you alone are God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zec 14:9 And the LORD will be king over all the earth. On that day the LORD will be one and his name one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In looking at our days now, it appears this remnant could be very small. There is definitely a lack of fear of God in our day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-155-6&#34;&gt;Rev 15:5-6&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;After this I looked, and the sanctuary of the tent of witness in heaven was opened, 6 and out of the sanctuary came the seven angels with the seven plagues, clothed in pure, bright linen, with golden sashes around their chests.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this = &lt;em&gt;meta tauta&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; always a sign that the scene has shifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we are back in &amp;ldquo;real time&amp;rdquo; (so to speak). The flash-forward is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are building up to the seven bowls of wrath and back in the Heavenly Tabernacle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-157--8&#34;&gt;Rev 15:7 -8&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God who lives forever and ever, 8 and the sanctuary was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incense bowls were used in the temple service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filling with smoke recalls the tabernacle/temple filled with God&amp;rsquo;s glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-161&#34;&gt;Rev 16:1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Then I heard a loud voice from the temple telling the seven angels, &amp;ldquo;Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next time, we will look at the pouring out of God&amp;rsquo;s judgment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;revelation-16&#34;&gt;Revelation 16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;read-the-portion&#34;&gt;Read the portion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;15-5-8 After this I looked, and the sanctuary (that is, the Tent of Witness in heaven) was opened, and out of the sanctuary came the seven angels with the seven plagues. They were dressed in clean bright linen and had gold belts around their chests. One of the four living beings gave to the seven angels seven gold bowls filled with the fury of God, who lives forever and ever. Then the sanctuary was filled with smoke from God&amp;rsquo;s Sh&amp;rsquo;khinah, that is, from his power; and no one could enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels had accomplished their purpose. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Then I heard a loud voice from the temple telling the seven angels, &amp;ldquo;Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God.&amp;rdquo; So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and harmful and painful sores came upon the people who bore the mark of the beast and worshiped its image. The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became like the blood of a corpse, and every living thing died that was in the sea. The third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood. And I heard the angel in charge of the waters say, &amp;ldquo;Just are you, O Holy One, who is and who was, for you brought these judgments. For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. It is what they deserve!&amp;rdquo; And I heard the altar saying, &amp;ldquo;Yes, Lord God the Almighty, true and just are your judgments!&amp;rdquo; The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was allowed to scorch people with fire. They were scorched by the fierce heat, and they cursed the name of God who had power over these plagues. They did not repent and give him glory. The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in anguish and cursed the God of heaven for their pain and sores. They did not repent of their deeds. The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, to prepare the way for the kings from the east. And I saw, coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs. For they are demonic spirits, performing signs, who go abroad to the kings of the whole world, to assemble them for battle on the great day of God the Almighty. (&amp;ldquo;Behold, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake, keeping his garments on, that he may not go about naked and be seen exposed!&amp;rdquo;) And they assembled them at the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon. The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple, from the throne, saying, &amp;ldquo;It is done!&amp;rdquo; And there were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, and a great earthquake such as there had never been since man was on the earth, so great was that earthquake. The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell, and God remembered Babylon the great, to make her drain the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath. And every island fled away, and no mountains were to be found. And great hailstones, about one hundred pounds each, fell from heaven on people; and they cursed God for the plague of the hail because the plague was so severe. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;graphics&#34;&gt;Graphics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/image1.png&#34; cap=&#34;Graphic #1&#34; /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some overlap between the seven bowls and the ten plagues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also overlap between Revelation 8 (the trumpet judgments) and Revelation 16, suggesting to some that that Revelation should be read in terms of retelling the same events with different focus/intensity versus a linear narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example might be Joseph&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of Pharoah&amp;rsquo;s two dreams in Genesis 41.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first dream was 7 emaciated cows who ate the seven fat cows. The second dream was seven blighted ears of corn that consumed seven plump, full ears of corn. The two visions spoke of the same event: the seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A valid interpretation of Revelation is that the Seals, Trumpets and Bowls are all speaking of the same events, as opposed to 21 different and distinct judgments (seven seal judgments, followed by seven trumpet judgments, followed by seven bowl judgments).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, this would have reminded John&amp;rsquo;s readers that they were protected from God&amp;rsquo;s judgments just like the Israelites of old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their deliverance is drawing near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zechariah 14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have looked at key Old Testament chapters such as Daniel 7. Another one of these is Zechariah 14. Let&amp;rsquo;s become familiar with this important passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behold, a day is coming for the LORD, when the spoil taken from you will be divided in your midst. For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city shall be taken and the houses plundered and the women raped. Half of the city shall go out into exile, but the rest of the people shall not be cut off from the city. &lt;strong&gt;Then the LORD will go out and fight against those nations as when he fights on a day of battle. On that day his feet shall stand on the Mount of Olives that lies before Jerusalem on the east, and the Mount of Olives shall be split in two from east to west by a very wide valley, so that one half of the Mount shall move northward, and the other half southward.&lt;/strong&gt; And you shall flee to the valley of my mountains, for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal. And you shall flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD my God will come, and all the holy ones with him. On that day there shall be no light, cold, or frost. And there shall be a unique day, which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but at evening time there shall be light. On that day living waters shall flow out from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea and half of them to the western sea. It shall continue in summer as in winter. And the LORD will be king over all the earth. On that day the LORD will be one and his name one. The whole land shall be turned into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. But Jerusalem shall remain aloft on its site from the Gate of Benjamin to the place of the former gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king&amp;rsquo;s winepresses. And it shall be inhabited, for there shall never again be a decree of utter destruction. Jerusalem shall dwell in security. &lt;strong&gt;And this shall be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples that wage war against Jerusalem: their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths. And on that day a great panic from the LORD shall fall on them, so that each will seize the hand of another, and the hand of the one will be raised against the hand of the other.&lt;/strong&gt; Even Judah will fight at Jerusalem. And the wealth of all the surrounding nations shall be collected, gold, silver, and garments in great abundance. And a plague like this plague shall fall on the horses, the mules, the camels, the donkeys, and whatever beasts may be in those camps. Then everyone who survives of all the nations that have come against Jerusalem shall go up year after year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Booths. And if any of the families of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them. And if the family of Egypt does not go up and present themselves, then on them there shall be no rain; there shall be the plague with which the LORD afflicts the nations that do not go up to keep the Feast of Booths. This shall be the punishment to Egypt and the punishment to all the nations that do not go up to keep the Feast of Booths. And on that day there shall be inscribed on the bells of the horses, &amp;ldquo;Holy to the LORD.&amp;rdquo; And the pots in the house of the LORD shall be as the bowls before the altar. And every pot in Jerusalem and Judah shall be holy to the LORD of hosts, so that all who sacrifice may come and take of them and boil the meat of the sacrifice in them. And there shall no longer be a trader in the house of the LORD of hosts on that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zechariah 14:12-13 appear to suggest the first and fifth bowl judgments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-161&#34;&gt;Rev 16:1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; Then I heard a loud voice from the temple telling the seven angels, &amp;ldquo;Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-162&#34;&gt;Rev 16:2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and harmful and painful sores came upon the people who bore the mark of the beast and worshiped its image.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sores were the 6th plague of Egypt (Exodus 9:10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like those that afflicted Egypt, these sores afflicted only those who had the mark of the beast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s heart, the hearts of these people remain hard. We will see at the end of the chapter that they will curse God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deu 28:15, 35 &amp;ldquo;But if you will not obey the voice of the LORD your God or be careful to do all his commandments and his statutes that I command you today, then all these curses shall come upon you and overtake you&amp;hellip;. The LORD will strike you on the knees and on the legs with grievous boils of which you cannot be healed, from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 79:1-7 A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the nations have come into your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple; they have laid Jerusalem in ruins. [2] They have given the bodies of your servants to the birds of the heavens for food, the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the earth. [3] They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them. [4] We have become a taunt to our neighbors, mocked and derided by those around us. [5] How long, O LORD? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire? [6] Pour out your anger on the nations that do not know you, and on the kingdoms that do not call upon your name! [7] For they have devoured Jacob and laid waste his habitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zep 3:8 &amp;ldquo;Therefore wait for me,&amp;rdquo; declares the LORD, &amp;ldquo;for the day when I rise up to seize the prey. For my decision is to gather nations, to assemble kingdoms, to pour out upon them my indignation, all my burning anger; for in the fire of my jealousy all the earth shall be consumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-163&#34;&gt;Rev 16:3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became like the blood of a corpse, and every living thing died that was in the sea.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water to blood was the first plague in Exodus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plague upon the seas (salt water) was the 2nd trumpet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-164&#34;&gt;Rev 16:4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;The third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making the fresh waters bitter (Wormwood) was the 3rd trumpet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;rsquo;t told how far apart the bowl judgments are from one another. The lack of fresh water would certainly mean life is not sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might also be a connection with “wine” that we talked about in the last lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water to blood was the first plague and water to wine was the first miracle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water to wine is joyful for believers, but non-believers get the wrath of water to blood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, every single person who lived and who will ever live will drink one of two cups.  Either the miracle of Jesus’ blessing or the miracle of His wrath.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no other option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-165-7&#34;&gt;Rev 16:5-7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;And I heard the angel in charge of the waters say, &amp;ldquo;Just are you, O Holy One, who is and who was, for you brought these judgments. For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. It is what they deserve!&amp;rdquo; And I heard the altar saying, &amp;ldquo;Yes, Lord God the Almighty, true and just are your judgments!&amp;rdquo; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While God is patient and longsuffering, and while life often has the appearance of the wicked prospering, there is a side to Him that carries the sense of, &amp;ldquo;If you mess with My people, then you&amp;rsquo;re messing with Me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flipside, lest we think these punishments are cruel and unusual, we are reminded that God is just.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 49:26: I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh, and they shall be drunk with their own blood as with wine. Then all flesh shall know that I am the LORD your Savior, and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zech 14:12 And this shall be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples that wage war against Jerusalem: their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-168-9&#34;&gt;Rev 16:8-9&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was allowed to scorch people with fire They were scorched by the fierce heat, and they cursed the name of God who had power over these plagues. They did not repent and give him glory.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 19:9 the fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; the rules of the LORD are true, and righteous altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not specifically one of the plagues of Egypt, but hail was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hail mixed with fire was the first trumpet judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They recognize that God is sending the plagues, but they do not repent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, the ancients, including Babylon, worshipped the sun as a deity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1610-11&#34;&gt;Rev 16:10-11&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in anguish and cursed the God of heaven for their pain and sores. They did not repent of their deeds.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we recall the boast in Revelation 13, &amp;ldquo;who is able to make war with the beast?&amp;rdquo; Answer: God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darkness was the 9th plague in Egypt and the fourth trumpet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exodus 10:21 notes the darkness in Egypt could be &amp;ldquo;felt.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1612&#34;&gt;Rev 16:12&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;12 The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, to prepare the way for the kings from the east. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/image4.png&#34; cap=&#34;Graphic #1&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the Nile and the Tigris, the Euphrates is one of the major rivers of antiquity around which the earliest civilizations were founded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre-Flood, the Tigris and Euphrates were two of four rivers that flowed out of Eden (remember, we have no idea what the geography/topography of the earth looked like before the Flood).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God established the Euphrates as the Eastern Boundary of the land promised to Abraham (Genesis 15:18).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David&amp;rsquo;s kingdom extended all the way to the Euphrates (2 Sam 8:3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other mention in the New Testament came back in Revelation 9:14 &amp;ldquo;Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that audience, a reference to the &amp;ldquo;Kings of the East&amp;rdquo; would have been obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Parthians were Rome&amp;rsquo;s archenemy to the east, with the Euphrates serving as the boundary between the Roman and Parthian empires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While swollen rivers delayed the crossing of armies until engineers built floats or bridges, dried rivers had the opposite effect. An advancing army would encounter no delay whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Euphrates is the launching point of the attack. Megiddo is the staging ground (Rev 16:16). Jerusalem is the final battleground (Zechariah 14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1613-14&#34;&gt;Rev 16:13-14&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; And I saw, coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs. For they are demonic spirits, performing signs, who go abroad to the kings of the whole world, to assemble them for battle on the great day of God the Almighty.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Satanic trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we have a brief interlude between #6 and #7, just as we saw with the seals and trumpets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of being a chapter or two, this break is only a few verses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the break is about the famous passage of Armageddon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frogs were the second plague of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the satanic trinity, as demonic as they are, are being compelled to act to bring about God&amp;rsquo;s judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gathering the nations for judgment is a familiar idiom in the Old Testament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eze 30:2-3 &amp;ldquo;Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: &amp;ldquo;Wail, &amp;lsquo;Alas for the day!&amp;rsquo; [3] For the day is near, the day of the LORD is near; it will be a day of clouds, a time of doom for the nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joel 3:2-3 I will gather all the nations and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. And I will enter into judgment with them there, on behalf of my people and my heritage Israel, because they have scattered them among the nations and have divided up my land, [3] and have cast lots for my people, and have traded a boy for a prostitute, and have sold a girl for wine and have drunk it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joel 3:11 Hasten and come, all you surrounding nations, and gather yourselves there. Bring down your warriors, O LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zep 3:8 &amp;ldquo;Therefore wait for me,&amp;rdquo; declares the LORD, &amp;ldquo;for the day when I rise up to seize the prey. For my decision is to gather nations, to assemble kingdoms, to pour out upon them my indignation, all my burning anger; for in the fire of my jealousy all the earth shall be consumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 43:9 All the nations gather together, and the peoples assemble. Who among them can declare this, and show us the former things? Let them bring their witnesses to prove them right, and let them hear and say, It is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1615&#34;&gt;Rev 16:15&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;(&amp;ldquo;Behold, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake, keeping his garments on, that he may not go about naked and be seen exposed!&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This verse is usually displayed as red text signifying the direct words of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discussed the thief at night in the letter to Sardis (Rev 3:3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus frequently uses disagreeable characters in His examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is called a &amp;ldquo;how much more&amp;rdquo; argument, or in Hebrew Kol vhomer, which means &amp;ldquo;light and heavy&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be confusing for us as the punchline is often not stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I come like a thief means If one takes precautions to not be overcome by a thief at night, how much more should one make himself ready for Jesus&amp;rsquo; sudden return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Th 5:4 But you are not in darkness, brothers, for that day to surprise you like a thief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observant Jews were extremely modest and found the open display of nakedness in the Greco-Roman culture revolting. For example, most athletic competitors were naked, and circumcised Jewish males were ridiculed for their &amp;ldquo;differences.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recipients would have recalled Jesus&amp;rsquo; cautions to the church of Sardis to be clothed in white garments by not compromising with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 3:4-5 Yet you have still a few names in Sardis, people who have not soiled their garments, and they will walk with me in white, for they are worthy. [5] The one who conquers will be clothed thus in white garments, and I will never blot his name out of the book of life. I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overarching theme in Revelation is, &amp;ldquo;things may seem bad now, and may get worse; but God is in control. Hold fast.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1616&#34;&gt;Rev 16:16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;And they assembled them at the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image5.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armageddon is a transliteration of Hebrew Har Megiddo &amp;ndash; the Mount of Megiddo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A minority opinion would say it is &amp;ldquo;Ir Megiddo&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; the city of Megiddo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megiddo is about 60 miles north of Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ridge system (The Carmel Range) separates the central coastal plains from the fertile Jezreel Valley and Lower Galilee. The Megiddo Pass was one of three routes through the hills. Megiddo is at the northern edge of this pass and commanded the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travelers from Egypt to Assyria using the Via Maris had to use one of these three passes, so it was an opportune area for taxation and trade in times of peace, and a critical junction to hold in times of war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megiddo was first mentioned by Thutmose III, who boasted, &amp;ldquo;taking Megiddo is like capturing a thousand cities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tel at Megiddo has 26 levels of occupation (meaning the city was built, abandoned, filled in and rebuilt 26 different times dating back to the copper age around the 5th millennium BCE, and through the Persian conquest in the 7th Century common era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a wonderful place to see different ages of ancient history all in one location and remarkably well-preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron Age Gates and other buildings from the time of King Solomon (10th century BCE) and Ahab (9th century BCE)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tripartite buildings from the 11th and 10th centuries BCE (also seen at Hazor, Beersheba, and other locations)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancient water systems in fortified towns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King Solomon had a stronghold here along with Hazor and Gezer (1 kings 9:15) and Josiah was killed by Pharaoh Neco here (2 Kings 23:29-30).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image6.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also has a commanding view of the Jezreel Valley&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many noteworthy events of Biblical History occurred in this region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(separate video?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image7.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Napoleon declared Megiddo as &amp;ldquo;the most natural battleground of the whole earth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of days, there won&amp;rsquo;t actually be a battle here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be an assembly area for the armies of the beast, much like southern England was the gathering point for Allied troops before Sailing or parachuting into Normandy on D-day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the sneak preview; Revelation 14:1 is consistent with Zechariah 12:11 and Zechariah 14, in suggesting the actual battle will take place at Jerusalem. (Also Joel and Isaiah reference this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of action, Armageddon has entered our vocabulary as pertaining to cataclysmic military destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jezreel valley would provide more than enough space for the gathering of the army mentioned in Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They think they are assembling to go fight God but it is actually God who is having them assembled for their own destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nazareth lies directly across from Megiddo. Did Jesus look across the valley and weep at the arrogance and defiance of those He came to save?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1617&#34;&gt;Rev 16:17&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple, from the throne, saying, &amp;ldquo;It is done!&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 66:6 &amp;ldquo;The sound of an uproar from the city! A sound from the temple! The sound of the LORD, rendering recompense to his enemies!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the brief pause to mention Armageddon, we have the 7th angel pouring out his bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reads like a theophany, a visible or audible manifestation of God&amp;rsquo;s glory. I assume this is either the same voice who said &amp;ldquo;this is my Son in whom I am well pleased&amp;rdquo; or the same voice who said &amp;ldquo;It is finished&amp;rdquo; on the Cross&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although we should note this is not the word &lt;em&gt;Tetelestai&lt;/em&gt; that Jesus spoke on the cross. &lt;em&gt;Tetelestai&lt;/em&gt; is an accounting term meaning &amp;ldquo;paid in full.&amp;rdquo; This is &lt;em&gt;gegonen&lt;/em&gt;, which means done, completed, or fulfilled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1618-19&#34;&gt;Rev 16:18-19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;And there were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, and a great earthquake such as there had never been since man was on the earth, so great was that earthquake. The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell, and God remembered Babylon the great, to make her drain the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 14:8-10 Another angel, a second, followed, saying, &amp;ldquo;Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who made all nations drink the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality.&amp;rdquo; [9] And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, [10] he also will drink the wine of God&amp;rsquo;s wrath, poured full strength into the cup of his anger, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exo 19:15-19 And he said to the people, &amp;ldquo;Be ready for the third day; do not go near a woman.&amp;rdquo; [16] On the morning of the third day there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud on the mountain and a very loud trumpet blast, so that all the people in the camp trembled. [17] Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain. [18] Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the LORD had descended on it in fire. The smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain trembled greatly. [19] And as the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in thunder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More noise. We should be used to this but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure we&amp;rsquo;ll ever get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an unusual earthquake, perhaps the same one as the sixth seal or more likely the events in Zechariah 14:4 as we looked at previously:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zec 14:4 On that day his feet shall stand on the Mount of Olives that lies before Jerusalem on the east, and the Mount of Olives shall be split in two from east to west by a very wide valley so that one half of the Mount shall move northward, and the other half southward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We looked at some winepress references last time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also compare: Jer 25:15 Thus the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me: &amp;ldquo;Take from my hand this cup of the wine of wrath, and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;God remembered&amp;rdquo; is a very Hebraic phrase. God &amp;ldquo;remembered&amp;rdquo; Noah, Abraham, and Rachel. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that He forgot; it is that He is intentional about fulfilling a promise or a covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here God is granting the request made back in Chapter 6 when the martyrs cried out for justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good speculation for the &amp;ldquo;three parts&amp;rdquo; would be religious, commercial/economic, and political, the destruction of each will be detailed in chapters 17 and 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1620-21&#34;&gt;Rev 16:20-21&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; And every island fled away, and no mountains were to be found. And great hailstones, about one hundred pounds each, fell from heaven on people; and they cursed God for the plague of the hail, because the plague was so severe.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 6:14 The sky vanished like a scroll that is being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of the world is usually associated with vast terrestrial and cosmic devastation. Apparently, we need to visit the islands of Hawaii and the Bahamas while we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hail was the seventh plague, but this hail is far more severe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people&amp;rsquo;s unrepentance demonstrates how deserving they were of the judgment to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hail is often seen as the equivalent of the Old Testament capital punishment method of stoning. Murder, working on the sabbath, sorcery, kidnapping, sexual perversions, and blasphemy were all capital offenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase reminds me of the terrible advice from Job&amp;rsquo;s wife when Job was being afflicted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Job 2:9 Then his wife said to him, &amp;ldquo;Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exodus 9:34-35 But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned yet again and hardened his heart, he and his servants. {35} So the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people of Israel go, just as the LORD had spoken through Moses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to remember that the narrative flow in Revelation is not necessarily linear. Vss 20, 21 are clearly the &amp;ldquo;end of the world as we know it,&amp;rdquo; but we&amp;rsquo;re going to keep circling in for more detail. Chapters 17-19 are going to fill in the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;revelation-17----the-woman-who-rides-the-beast&#34;&gt;Revelation 17 &amp;ndash; the woman who rides the beast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, &amp;ldquo;Come, I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who is seated on many waters, with whom the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality, and with the wine of whose sexual immorality the dwellers on earth have become drunk.&amp;rdquo; And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was full of blasphemous names, and it had seven heads and ten horns. The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet and adorned with gold and jewels and pearls, holding in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her sexual immorality. And on her forehead was written a name of mystery: &amp;ldquo;Babylon the great, mother of prostitutes and of earth&amp;rsquo;s abominations.&amp;rdquo; And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints, the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I marveled greatly. But the angel said to me, &amp;ldquo;Why do you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her. The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to rise from the bottomless pit and go to destruction. And the dwellers on earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel to see the beast because it was and is not and is to come. This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated; they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he does come he must remain only a little while. As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven, and it goes to destruction. And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power, but they are to receive authority as kings for one hour, together with the beast. These are of one mind, and they hand over their power and authority to the beast. They will make war on the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with him are called and chosen and faithful.&amp;rdquo; And the angel said to me, &amp;ldquo;The waters that you saw, where the prostitute is seated, are peoples and multitudes and nations and languages. And the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast will hate the prostitute. They will make her desolate and naked, devour her flesh and burn her up with fire, for God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by being of one mind and handing over their royal power to the beast until the words of God are fulfilled. And the woman that you saw is the great city that has dominion over the kings of the earth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God refers to idolatry as spiritual adultery. Following false gods is spiritually equivalent to engaging a prostitute. He applies this primarily to his unfaithful people (including Gentile believers, as we saw in the letters to Pergamum and Thyatira) and pagan nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 26 portrays Tyre as a harlot: Isa 23:16 &amp;ldquo;Take a harp; go about the city, O forgotten prostitute! Make sweet melody; sing many songs, that you may be remembered.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nahum also describes Nineveh as a harlot and a sorceress: Nah 3:4-5 And all for the countless whorings of the prostitute, graceful and deadly charms, who betrays nations with her whorings, and peoples with her charms. [5] Behold, I am against you, declares the LORD of hosts, and will lift up your skirts over your face; and I will make nations look at your nakedness and kingdoms at your shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in Revelation, the Harlot symbolism is both literal and figurative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is described as a prostitute and a sorceress (Rev 18:23),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is also an agent of the system to entice others, which is idolatry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a harlot? Imitation love. False affection. Intimacy for hire. Both parties knowingly engage in deceit&amp;mdash;the ultimate symbol of broken fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there anything in your life that fits one or all of those definitions? A job? A habit? A possession? A person?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deu 23:2 &amp;ldquo;No one born of a forbidden union may enter the assembly of the LORD. Even to the tenth generation, none of his descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we enjoin with a harlot (literal or figurative), we &amp;ldquo;father&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;give birth to&amp;rdquo; an illegitimate offspring that interferes in our relationship with God. Just as Jesus makes a way for one who was literally born of a forbidden union, He can cleanse all our forbidden works and make us right with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whom-does-the-woman-represent&#34;&gt;Whom does the woman represent?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairly or unfairly, protestants have equated the woman of Revelation 17 to the Catholic Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Church has a sordid history of blood, is based in Rome, and features scarlet and purple in its pageantry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave Hunt &amp;ndash; a woman rides the beast dives into this &amp;ndash; while it&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating read into the inner workings of the Catholic Church, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure we can conclude that&amp;rsquo;s whom John had in mind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/image1.png&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:left&#34;/&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;images/image2.png&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-   As with the Church at Sardis that had nothing good said about it, Protestants who see the whore of Babylon as the Catholic church might be interested to know that she is also described as the &amp;quot;mother of all harlots.&amp;quot; The protestant church was born directly from the Catholic church.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others see America as we are the world&amp;rsquo;s chief exporter of all that God hates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people even refer to the American system (commercial and political) as &amp;ldquo;Babylon.&amp;rdquo; The epitaph is justified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, such views would not have occurred to John or his audience as neither the Catholic Church nor America existed in the 1st century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is our custom, while we may point out some similarities to our day, we will primarily stick to letting the Bible interpret Revelation instead of current events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God, Himself, may reassign the symbolism of Babylon to America, the Catholic Church, or some other entity when all this goes down; until then, we need to tread lightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first-century audience would have known Babylon was a pseudonym for Rome. Verse 18 tells us that the woman is the city. The beast she rides is the system behind the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter likely used Babylon in the same way. It is more likely that the person he&amp;rsquo;s referring was in Rome and not in the Iraqi desert (although Babylon at that time did have a substantial Jewish population).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Pe 5:13 She who is at Babylon, who is likewise chosen, sends you greetings, and so does Mark, my son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 13, 14 and Jeremiah 50, 51 should be required pre-reading on Babylon before reading Revelation 17, 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah 51:7 is a crucial verse that will run throughout Revelation 17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jer 51:7 Babylon was a golden cup in the LORD&amp;rsquo;s hand, making all the earth drunken; the nations drank of her wine; therefore the nations went mad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;babylon-history&#34;&gt;Babylon History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/image3.png&#34; /&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babylon is mentioned over 300 times in the Bible, often contrasted with Jerusalem &amp;ndash; the city of the harlot versus the city of God (even though Jerusalem is sometimes called a harlot, it is still the city chosen by God).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is mentioned three times in Christ&amp;rsquo;s genealogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the capital of the 1st World Dictator and will also be the capital of the last World Dictator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded by Nimrod, &amp;ldquo;a mighty hunter &lt;em&gt;in defiance of&lt;/em&gt; the Lord (Genesis 10); ill-fated Tower of Bab-el (Gate of God or Gateway to God).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(compare languages scattered at Bab-el to all understanding one language in Acts 2 &amp;ndash; interesting that Georgia Guidestones referenced a single universal language)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Babel was man&amp;rsquo;s vain attempt to reach God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal was a sacred city that could challenge heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast with Jerusalem, a city whose builder and maker is God (Heb 11:10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the tower is gone, the Babylonian religious system is still with us today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our modern horoscope has its roots in ancient Babylon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 1900 BCE, Abraham was called from Ur of the Chaldees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars have postulated two (sometimes three) possible locations for the &amp;ldquo;Ur of the Chaldees&amp;rdquo; from where God called Abram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The northern conjecture would place it in northwest Syria near Haran. Interestingly, most Jewish tradition places Abraham here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The southern conjecture would place it around Babylon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaldea later became known as the general region of southern Mesopotamia, but it is not certain that this is the term&amp;rsquo;s meaning as used in Genesis 11:28, 31.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, Abraham (at the time an idol-worshipping gentile) was called out of Mesopotamia to Israel, setting up the contrast of Israel versus the gentile nations, the capital of which is Ur/Babylon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hammurabi was likely a contemporary of Jacob, and Joseph was a king of the First Babylonian Dynasty. He is known for his famous law code, which parallels the Mosaic law in many respects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the time of the Kings of Judah, Babylon was a minor administrative center of Assyria through the mid-600s when it started aspiring for independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, Assyria to the north and Egypt to the south were the heavy hitters (and keep in mind Israel sandwiched between these giants of the ancient world along the great international highway).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nabopolassar and his son Nebuchadnezzar attacked Nineveh in 612 BCE and destroyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, a remnant of Assyrian forces allied with Egypt and Pharoah Neco II&amp;rsquo;s forces marched northward to come to the aid of their new ally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Along the way, for reasons historians don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand, good king Josiah decided to pick a fight with the Egyptians at Megiddo in 609. This was not a wise move as Judah now became a vassal state to Egypt (albeit for a relatively short period).  We can read about this in  2 Chr 35:20-24&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nebuchadnezzar would ultimately defeat Pharoah Neco at the famous battle of Carchemish in 605.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also laid siege to Jerusalem three times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first was right after the battle of Carchemish. This resulted in King Jehoiakim being forced to pay tribute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second was in 597 BCE, which was the first deportation. This siege occurred because Jehoiakim refused to pay tribute. Jehoiakim was executed, and Jehoiachin took his place. He was also known as Jeconiah or Coniah in the Bible. During the first deportation, the elite was sent to Babylon, including Daniel and his three friends.;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third siege was in 587/586, which destroyed the 1st temple and the 2nd deportation.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The destruction of the temple in 586 was a watershed moment in Judah&amp;rsquo;s history. It seemed God&amp;rsquo;s promises had failed. The people grappled with cognitive dissonance as everything they had been taught about being God&amp;rsquo;s chosen and blessed people was not at odds with reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A third deportation also occurred in 582.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nebuchadnezzar died in 562, and there were three kings with relatively short terms until Nabonidius took over in 553.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historical records show Belshazzar, who was Nebuchadnezzar&amp;rsquo;s grandson, was either a vice-regent or perhaps a co-regent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel chapter 5 tells the story of the fall of Babylon at the hands of Cyrus and the Persians. This is the famous &amp;ldquo;handwriting on the wall&amp;rdquo; episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As Daniel 5 recounts, that night, the Persians diverted the Euphrates and could enter Babylon without much resistance. Belshazzar was also killed that very night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missler says that the residents of Babylon weren&amp;rsquo;t aware they had been conquered for several days. Therefore, this is the FALL of Babylon, not the DESTRUCTION of Babylon that is prophesied in the Bible. The destruction is still in the future. Babylon has never been destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main points of the conquest as told by Daniel are confirmed by the Steele of Cyrus, which is on display in the British Museum today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a testimony to his character, Daniel, by now an elderly man, ascended again to administrative leadership in the Persian empire and was a friend to Darius much the same as he was a friend to Nebuchadnezzar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missler pointed out that only two men (besides Jesus) of whom no sin is recorded in the Bible. Joseph and Daniel. Chuck added, &amp;ldquo;and both were senior executives.&amp;rdquo; He said this with a wink in his eye because Chuck was himself a Fortune 500 CEO/senior executive before transitioning to vocational ministry!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;comparisons-of-babylon-to-rome&#34;&gt;Comparisons of Babylon to Rome&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are some reasons why Babylon would make a good &amp;ldquo;code name&amp;rdquo; for Rome:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both empires are the opposite (and opposed to) the Kingdom of Heaven, an &amp;ldquo;anti-kingdom&amp;rdquo; to go along with the &amp;ldquo;anti-Christ.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both empires destroyed Jerusalem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both empires destroyed the Jewish Temple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both empires carried the Jewish people into exile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if one wanted to refer to Rome in an environment where speaking out against Rome directly was illegal, Babylon would have been an easily understood substitute..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One last preliminary comment: several outlines consider chapter 17 to begin the final section of Revelation. 17/18 &amp;ndash; Mystery Babylon; 19- The return of the King, 20, the Millenium, 21-Eternity, 22-Conclusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-171-2&#34;&gt;Rev 17:1-2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;1 Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, &amp;ldquo;Come, I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who is seated on many waters, with whom the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality, and with the wine of whose sexual immorality the dwellers on earth have become drunk.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 1:21 How the faithful city has become a whore, she who was full of justice! Righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rome dominated the lands around the Mediterranean sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Waters&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;sea&amp;rdquo; often equals &amp;ldquo;nations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 14:8 Another angel, a second, followed, saying, &amp;ldquo;Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who made all nations drink the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any local ruler or magistrate could have been called a &amp;ldquo;king&amp;rdquo; in the roman empire even though they were subservient to Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah 51:7 Babylon was a golden cup in the LORD&amp;rsquo;s hand, making all the earth drunken; the nations drank of her wine; therefore the nations went mad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although referenced here, the actual judgment occurs in our Chapter 18&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter breaks are man&amp;rsquo;s insertions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If time were no object, we would study chapters 16-19, along with Isaiah 13-14 and Jeremiah 50-51, in one sitting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-173&#34;&gt;Rev 17:3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;3 And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was full of blasphemous names, and it had seven heads and ten horns.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan 7:24 As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom, ten kings shall arise, and another shall arise after them; he shall be different from the former ones and shall put down three kings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John is &amp;ldquo;in the Spirit,&amp;rdquo; as in Chapter 1. We contrast John&amp;rsquo;s being carried to heaven previously but to a wilderness here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For God&amp;rsquo;s people, a biblical wilderness is a place of tempting, testing, and, ultimately, God&amp;rsquo;s provision (Revelation 12:14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, John appears to be saying that the harlot thinks she is ruler over many waters but is in a barren, desolate wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A beast, the she-wolf, is said to have sustained the twins Romulus and Remus in their infancy before the founding of Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blasphemous names might have referred to the Roman Emperor&amp;rsquo;s desire to be worshipped, as in, &amp;ldquo;my Lord, my God, Domitian.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first-century audience might have associated the seven heads with the first seven emperors (Julius Caesar through Vespasian, excluding the three short-term leaders in 68-69), but more likely with the four beasts of Daniel 7 that have a total of seven heads and ten horns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This imagery is repeated from Rev 12:3-4 and Rev 13:1-8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 13:1 And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads, with ten diadems on its horns and blasphemous names on its heads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many see the woman as symbolic of the beast&amp;rsquo;s false religious system (we will view the false commercial system in Chapter 18). If so, this is a state-run religion. We would be wrong if we think we don&amp;rsquo;t have this in America. We are now reaping the results of 40 years of enforced paganism in our public schools and are now at a place where our 1st and second graders are being educated on sexually explicit matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-174&#34;&gt;Rev 17:4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;4 The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet and adorned with gold and jewels and pearls, holding in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her sexual immorality.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Golden cup&amp;rdquo; is an overt allusion to Jer 51:6-8 &amp;ldquo;Flee from the midst of Babylon; let every one save his life! Be not cut off in her punishment, for this is the time of the LORD&amp;rsquo;s vengeance, the repayment he is rendering her. Babylon was a golden cup in the LORD&amp;rsquo;s hand, making all the earth drunken; the nations drank of her wine; therefore the nations went mad. Suddenly Babylon has fallen and been broken; wail for her! Take balm for her pain; perhaps she may be healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 18:3 For all nations have drunk the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality, and the kings of the earth have committed immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the power of her luxurious living.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scarlet probably has multiple meanings, including the blood of the martyrs (as we shall see in verse 6) and the color red&amp;rsquo;s long-standing association with prostitutes who wore red and purple to attract attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purple and scarlet required expensive dyes and communicated the wealth and &amp;ldquo;importance&amp;rdquo; of the person who wore them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purple was the predominant color of Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also contrast the woman clothed in earthly splendor with the woman of chapter 12, the heavenly woman clothed in white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the possibility that in chapters 17-18, we are &amp;ldquo;circling back&amp;rdquo; on chapters 13-16 for a different viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 18:6 Pay her back as she herself has paid back others, and repay her double for her deeds; mix a double portion for her in the cup she mixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seven bowls were cups of wrath. Revelation 14:10 and Revelation 16:9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verse 18, we are told that the woman is a literal city (presumably Rome). At the same time, the beast on which she rides is the imperial power of Rome &amp;ndash; the religious, political, and economic system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rome was very wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler sees literal Babylon on the banks of the Euphrates as rising again; others see a revised Rome/Roman Empire. The fictional Left Behind series imagined a blending of these two, with the Revived Roman empire having a significant administrative center in literal Babylon in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As neither Rome nor Babylon is of much global significance today, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to visualize either being the center of a world empire; but things can change quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll have to watch and see!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-175&#34;&gt;Rev 17:5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;5 And on her forehead was written a name of mystery: &amp;ldquo;Babylon the great, mother of prostitutes and of earth&amp;rsquo;s abominations.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 14:8 Another angel, a second, followed, saying, &amp;ldquo;Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who made all nations drink the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mother of&amp;rdquo; has been used throughout the ages to denote an exponential extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just a bomb, but the mother of all bombs. Not just a prostitute but the mother of all prostitutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the harlots that have ever been, Babylon is the most terrible of them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ancient cultures, a modest woman&amp;rsquo;s head would have been covered, so the fact that the harlot&amp;rsquo;s forehead is visible at all is offensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have the &amp;ldquo;forehead&amp;rdquo; theme continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mark of the beast is on the forehead or the right hand, as is the seal of the redeemed,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Deuteronomy 6:8, we are commanded to bind God&amp;rsquo;s words to our hands and to let His words be as &amp;ldquo;frontlets to our eyes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 22:4 They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immediate application is presumed that John used the term &amp;ldquo;Babylon&amp;rdquo; to avoid Roman censors, just as Peter did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-176&#34;&gt;Rev 17:6&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;6 And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints, the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I marveled greatly.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the major ancient empires, Rome had a peculiar thirst for blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roman entertainment and forms of punishment were notoriously violent (and often, the two were mixed with criminals and slaves slaughtered as sport for the masses).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Christians were criminals under Nero and Domitian, they provided an ample supply of victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Daniel before him, John wondered what the significance was of what he saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-177-8&#34;&gt;Rev 17:7-8&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;7 But the angel said to me, &amp;ldquo;Why do you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her. 8 The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to rise from the bottomless pit and go to destruction. And the dwellers on earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel to see the beast because it was and is not and is to come.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was, is not, and is to come&amp;rdquo; is a parody of the eternal God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 1:4 John to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possible application from Dr. Stern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beast who was: Antiochus IV, who outlawed Judaism, enforced paganism, and desecrated the temple by sacrificing a pig to Zeus in the Holy of Holies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beast who is not: as evil as Domitian is, he&amp;rsquo;s not the anti-Christ, but he and Nero come from the same source as the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beast is to come &amp;ndash; the actual anti-Christ who will be worse than Antiochus IV but ultimately be destroyed (in Rev 20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven heads and ten horns is a combination of the four beasts of Daniel 7 we looked at previously. The end-times revived empire will be worse than all the previous empires combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John may have marveled, but those not written in the book of life (the &amp;ldquo;earth dwellers&amp;rdquo;) will marvel more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-179-11&#34;&gt;Rev 17:9-11&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;9 This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated; they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he does come he must remain only a little while. As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but belongs to the seven and goes to destruction.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a key to apocalyptic literature &amp;ndash; the symbols don&amp;rsquo;t have to refer to just one thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seven crowns are the seven hills of Rome and the kings at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rome celebrated the fact that it stood on seven hills &amp;ndash; there was even a pagan festival called Septimontium for the seven mountains/hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecting the Roman emperors to the seven kings is not as straightforward as it might seem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “other has not yet come” statement rules out Nero and Domitian because they had come.  There have been bad dudes on the scene but none so bad as Antiochus until we get to Hitler, and we can look in the rear-view mirror and conclude that Hitler was not the one who had not yet come.  We assume that the original audience understood the verses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hallmark of apocalyptic literature is that it is flexible in application &amp;ndash; often, we do not know what the prophecy referred to until AFTER the thing has come to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is just as plausible (given the 2000 years since Revelation was written) that all seven kings plus one are yet future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountains, in biblical symbolism, represent power and governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another view: seven kings &amp;ndash; five are fallen (Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece), one is (the ancient Roman Empire), one is not yet (the revived Roman empire (or related one-world government)). The 8th of the 7th is potentially when Satan takes direct control over the 7th empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t want to tell you what to think; we want to get you TO think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1712-13----ten-horns&#34;&gt;Rev 17:12-13 &amp;ndash; Ten Horns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;12 And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power, but they are to receive authority as kings for one hour, together with the beast. 13 These are of one mind, and they hand over their power and authority to the beast.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;they have not yet received royal power&amp;rdquo; in other words, speculation will be futile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This refers to Daniel 7:24. As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom, ten kings shall arise, and another shall arise after them; he shall be different from the former ones and put down three kings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 14 tells us that these are the kings of the east that cross the Euphrates on dry land and come to make war against God and gather at Megiddo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one sense, the identities of these kings are irrelevant. Their conspiracy against God is short-lived and will come to nothing, as we saw in Chapter 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1714&#34;&gt;Rev 17:14&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;14 They will make war on the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with him are called and chosen and faithful.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener notes that the Parthian King in that day referred to himself as &amp;ldquo;king of kings&amp;rdquo;; however, Christian and Jewish audiences rightfully applied these titles to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deut 10:17 For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who is not partial and takes no bribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1715-16&#34;&gt;Rev 17:15-16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;15 And the angel said to me, &amp;ldquo;The waters that you saw, where the prostitute is seated, are peoples and multitudes and nations and languages. 16 And the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast will hate the prostitute. They will make her desolate and naked, and devour her flesh and burn her up with fire,&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jer 51:11-14 &amp;ldquo;Sharpen the arrows! Take up the shields! The LORD has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes because his purpose concerning Babylon is to destroy it, for that is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance for his temple.[12] &amp;ldquo;Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon; make the watch strong; set up watchmen; prepare the ambushes; for the LORD has both planned and done what he spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon. [13] O you who dwell by many waters, rich in treasures, your end has come; the thread of your life is cut. [14] The LORD of hosts has sworn by himself: Surely I will fill you with men, as many as locusts, and they shall raise the shout of victory over you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eze 16:37 therefore, behold, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved and all those you hated. I will gather them against you from every side and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eze 23:35 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have forgotten me and cast me behind your back, you yourself must bear the consequences of your lewdness and whoring.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 8:5-8 The LORD spoke to me again: [6] &amp;ldquo;Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that flow gently, and rejoice over Rezin and the son of Remaliah, [7] therefore, behold, the Lord is bringing up against them the waters of the River, mighty and many, the king of Assyria and all his glory. And it will rise over all its channels and go over all its banks, [8] and it will sweep on into Judah, it will overflow and pass on, reaching even to the neck, and its outspread wings will fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we looked at before, the Medes &amp;amp; Persians conquered Babylon in Daniel 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say conquered, but they were more guilty of letting their guard down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rome wasn&amp;rsquo;t conquered by an external threat so much as it disintegrated from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weakness allowed the Vandals, Goths, etc., to move in and take over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nero himself is rumored to have burned Rome as a false flag to blame on Christians. Thus the Romans should have been smarter than to embrace a second Nero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After their defeat at the Valley of Jehoshaphat, these survivors of the armies of Gog and Magog will turn their fury against Babylon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death by fire is rarely mentioned as a punishment in the Torah; however, where it is mentioned is curious as it references a daughter of a priest who plays the harlot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lev 21:9 And the daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by whoring, profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burned by fire is also referenced in Rev 18:8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1717&#34;&gt;Rev 17:17&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;17 for God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by being of one mind and handing over their royal power to the beast until the words of God are fulfilled.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This becomes a thorny theological issue of whether God entices people to sin. To do so would seem out of character since He is not willing that any should perish, but all come to repentance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Kings 22:23 says the &amp;ldquo;Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets.&amp;rdquo;; if we read the passage carefully, we see that God has convened a council where an apparent angel suggests that he, the angel, go out and be the lying spirit. God isn&amp;rsquo;t the lying spirit Himself, but he permits it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 1 says that God &amp;ldquo;gives people over&amp;rdquo; to their sin, meaning He lets people continue along their path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that is what is in view here. These people were bent on rebellion, so God gave them over to follow the beast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In so doing, they will unwittingly contribute to the destruction of the Beast, which God has prophesied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is sovereign and can use the wicked to accomplish His purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1718&#34;&gt;Rev 17:18&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;18 And the woman that you saw is the great city that has dominion over the kings of the earth.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Great City often means Jerusalem; however, it is undoubtedly Rome in this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerusalem is hilly but not known as the city that sits on seven hills, and no one ruling in the world was subservient to Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rome, however, had both aspects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;City on seven hills&amp;rdquo; usually refers to Rome; however, a surprising number of notable world cities that might bear some semblance to a figurative Babylon make that claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They include Washington, D.C. (built on Capitol Hill, Meridian Hill, Floral Hills, Forest Hills, Hillbrook, Hillcrest, and Knox Hill), Mecca, Tehran, San Francisco, Seattle, and Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;woman-comparison&#34;&gt;Woman Comparison&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/image4.png&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the harlot is not the beast itself, but it rides upon the beast. In other words, it is yoked to the beast. She initially exploits the beast but is eventually destroyed by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll look at chapter 18 and the ultimate fall of Babylon next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;revelation-18----babylon-has-fallen&#34;&gt;Revelation 18 &amp;ndash; Babylon has Fallen!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;After these things, I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, the earth was lit up by his splendor. He cried out in a strong voice, &amp;ldquo;She has fallen! She has fallen! Bavel the Great! She has become a home for demons, a prison for every unclean spirit, a prison for every unclean, hated bird. &amp;ldquo;For all the nations have drunk of the wine of God&amp;rsquo;s fury caused by her whoring&amp;mdash;yes, the kings of the earth went whoring with her, and from her unrestrained love of luxury the world&amp;rsquo;s businessmen have grown rich.&amp;rdquo; Then I heard another voice out of heaven say: &amp;ldquo;My people, come out of her! so that you will not share in her sins, so that you will not be infected by her plagues, for her sins are a sticky mass piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes. &amp;ldquo;Render to her as she rendered to others! Pay her back double for what she has done! Use the cup in which she has brewed to brew her a double-sized drink! &amp;ldquo;Give her as much torment and sorrow as the glory and luxury she gave herself! For in her heart she says, &amp;lsquo;I sit a queen&amp;mdash;I am not a widow, I will never see sorrow.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Therefore, her plagues will come in a single day&amp;mdash;death, sorrow and famine; and she will be burned with fire, because Adonai, God, her Judge, is mighty&amp;rdquo; The kings of the earth who went whoring with her and shared her luxury will sob and wail over her when they see the smoke as she burns. Standing at a distance, for fear of her torment, they will say, &amp;ldquo;Oh no! The great city! Bavel, the mighty city! In a single hour your judgment has come!&amp;rdquo; The world&amp;rsquo;s businessmen weep and mourn over her, because no one is buying their merchandise any more&amp;mdash; stocks of gold and silver, gems and pearls, fine linen and purple, silk and scarlet, all rare woods, all ivory goods, all kinds of things made of scented wood, brass, iron and marble; cinnamon, cardamom, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, oil, flour, grain, cattle, sheep, horses, chariots&amp;mdash;and bodies&amp;mdash;and people&amp;rsquo;s souls. The fruits you lusted for with all your heart have gone! All the luxury and flashiness have been destroyed, never to return! The sellers of these things, who got rich from her, will stand at a distance, for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning, and saying, &amp;ldquo;Oh no! The great city used to wear fine linen, purple and scarlet! She glittered with gold, precious stones and pearls! Such great wealth&amp;mdash;in a single hour, ruined!&amp;rdquo; All the ship masters, passengers, sailors and everyone making his living from the sea stood at a distance and cried out when they saw the smoke as she burned, &amp;ldquo;What city was like the great city?&amp;rdquo; And they threw dust on their heads as they wept and mourned, saying, &amp;ldquo;Oh no! The great city! The abundance of her wealth made all the ship owners rich! In a single hour she is ruined!&amp;rdquo; Rejoice over her, heaven! Rejoice, people of God, emissaries and prophets! For in judging her, God has vindicated you. Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a great millstone, and hurled it into the sea, saying, &amp;ldquo;With violence like this will the great city Bavel be hurled down, never to be found again! &amp;ldquo;The sound of harpists and musicians, flute-players and trumpeters will never again be heard in you. No worker of any trade will ever again be found in you, the sound of a mill will never again be heard in you, the light of a lamp will never again shine in you, the voice of bridegroom and bride will never again be heard in you. &amp;ldquo;For your businessmen were the most powerful on earth, all the nations were deceived by your magic spell. &amp;ldquo;In her was found the blood of prophets and of God&amp;rsquo;s people, indeed, of all who have ever been slaughtered on earth!&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have mentioned, we need to view chapters 17 and 18 as a single unit. Babylon is here portrayed as a harlot, enticing the people. Babylon is distinct from the Beast or its heads. We will see that God is going to directly intervene to destroy the commercial system of Babylon; whereas, in chapter 17, He used the men who had used and abused the harlot but then turned on her to destroy the religious or political system (Rev 17:16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a recap, many see the seven heads and 10 horns as the 1st century Roman emperors, but this is problematic. We are told the 7th head &amp;ldquo;is not yet come&amp;rdquo; (Rev 17:10). Of the 10 horns, Rev 17:14 says they have not yet received authority. This makes speculation on the horns somewhat futile, except to say they come in the spirit of the horns of Daniel 8 and 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since kingdoms are often spoken of as &amp;ldquo;mountains&amp;rdquo;, it is possible that the seven heads are distinct empires, versus leaders of the same empire. Thus, one possible fit might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five that are fallen &amp;ndash; Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixth that is: Ancient Rome&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventh that is not yet: Revived Rome, or a dreadful combination of all former ancient empires (In Dan 7, no single beast has seven heads/10 horns but when you add up all the heads + horns we get 7/10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several nations/empires over the last 1500 years attempted to carry the mantle of Rome forward, including presently the world&amp;rsquo;s major superpower, which coincidently has an Eagle as its national symbol just as Rome did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the west, we sometimes forget that all of these ancient empires ruled the middle east. As we focus on Europe, we forget one of the longest, most dominating empires in all of history was the Islamic Ottoman Empire, which ruled from 1300 &amp;ndash; 1922.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &amp;ldquo;revived Roman Empire&amp;rdquo; will likely include the historic Turkish, Arabic, and Persian lands, while it may or may not include Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we tend to read &amp;ldquo;Babylon&amp;rdquo; as symbolic, an empire in this part of the world could very likely make its capital in literal Babylon, on the banks of the Euphrates in modern-day Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight that is of the seventh &amp;ndash; when the antichrist himself assumes control over the 7th empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cities-represent-satan&#34;&gt;Cities represent Satan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chapter resembles the lamentations over Tyre in Ezekiel 28 and Babylon is Isaiah 14. What is interesting about those two chapters, is that each morph into something that goes beyond the literal cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 14:12-15 &amp;ldquo;How you are fallen from heaven, O Day Star, son of Dawn! How you are cut down to the ground, you who laid the nations low! [13] You said in your heart, &amp;lsquo;I will ascend to heaven; above the stars of God I will set my throne on high; I will sit on the mount of assembly in the far reaches of the north; [14] I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.&amp;rsquo; [15] But you are brought down to Sheol, to the far reaches of the pit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eze 28:12-15 &amp;ldquo;Son of man, raise a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus says the Lord GOD: &amp;ldquo;You were the signet of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. [13] You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering, sardius, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, emerald, and carbuncle; and crafted in gold were your settings and your engravings. On the day that you were created they were prepared. [14] You were an anointed guardian cherub. I placed you; you were on the holy mountain of God; in the midst of the stones of fire you walked. [15] You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created, till unrighteousness was found in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The destruction of Babylon in Revelation 18 is really the destruction of the satan&amp;rsquo;s kingdom (leading up to the destruction of the satan himself in chapter 20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chapter follows the tradition of numerous laments, dirges, and oracles of woe against the enemies of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-181&#34;&gt;Rev 18:1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;After these things, I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his glory.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan 10:6 His body was like beryl, his face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta touta = a scene change. Like Joseph interpreted the dreams of the 14 cows and 14 stalks of grain and said they were the same, so too are chapters 17 and 18 separate views of two different aspects of Babylon. They are the same yet distinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very powerful angel and is likely one of the seven angels who poured out the bowls of wrath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-182&#34;&gt;Rev 18:2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;He cried out with a mighty voice, saying: &amp;ldquo;Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! She has become a den for demons, a haunt for every unclean spirit and for every unclean bird and for every unclean and detestable beast.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prophetic past tense &amp;ndash; the event is completed even though it has yet to occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 21:9 Look! Here comes a chariot of men, with a pair of horsemen.&amp;rdquo; Then one answered and said, &amp;ldquo;Fallen, fallen is Babylon! All the images of her gods are broken on the ground.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jer 51:8 Suddenly Babylon has fallen and been broken; wail for her! Take balm for her pain; perhaps she may be healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the unclean birds and beasts, compare Isaiah 13 and 34:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 13:19-22 And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the splendor and pomp of the Chaldeans, will be like Sodom and Gomorrah when God overthrew them. [20] It will never be inhabited or lived in for all generations; no Arab will pitch his tent there; no shepherds will make their flocks lie down there. [21] But wild animals will lie down there, and their houses will be full of howling creatures; there ostriches will dwell, and there wild goats will dance. [22] Hyenas will cry in its towers, and jackals in the pleasant palaces; its time is close at hand and its days will not be prolonged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 34:8-11 For the LORD has a day of vengeance, a year of recompense for the cause of Zion. [9] And the streams of Edom shall be turned into pitch, and her soil into sulfur; her land shall become burning pitch. [10] Night and day it shall not be quenched; its smoke shall go up forever. From generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it forever and ever. [11] But the hawk and the porcupine shall possess it, the owl and the raven shall dwell in it. He shall stretch the line of confusion over it, and the plumb line of emptiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, there are no people there anymore. This will be reiterated in verses 22-23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-183&#34;&gt;Rev 18:3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the fury of her immorality. The kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich off the power of her self-indulgence.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-184&#34;&gt;Rev 18:4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Then I heard another voice from heaven saying, &amp;ldquo;Come out of her, my people, lest you participate in her sins and receive her plagues!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a double entendre of sorts. &amp;ldquo;Come out of her&amp;rdquo; has an obvious sexual reference, since the people are described as fornicating with her (the Bible is VERY graphic like this in many places, surprisingly enough. It pulls no punches). It is also a call to flee to safety because there&amp;rsquo;s about to be a major artillery barrage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler sees seven connected verses related to fleeing Babylon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 48:20 &amp;ldquo;Get out of Babylon, flee from Chaldea! With a shout of joy, proclaim this, send it out to the end of the earth, say: &amp;lsquo;Adonai has redeemed His servant Jacob!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 52:11 Leave, leave! Get out of there! Touch no unclean thing. Go out of her midst. Purify yourselves, you who carry the vessels of Adonai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jer 50:8-9 &amp;ldquo;Flee from within Babylon, get out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be like he-goats before the flock. [9] For I will soon stir up and bring against Babylon an alliance of great nations from the north. They will form battle lines against her, from there she will be captured. Their arrows will be like a warrior who bereaves, not returning empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jer 51:6-8 Flee from within Babylon! Each one, escape with his soul! Be not silenced in her iniquity! For it is a time of vengeance for Adonai. He will repay her recompense. [7] Babylon has been a golden cup in Adonai&amp;rsquo;s hand, intoxicating the whole earth. The nations drunk her wine&amp;mdash;so the nations are going crazy. [8] Suddenly Babylon is fallen! Shattered! Howl over her! Bring balm for her wound. Perhaps she may be healed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zec 2:10-11 Oy, oy! Flee from the land of the north&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;it is a declaration of Adonai&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;because I scattered you like the four winds of heaven&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;it is a declaration of Adonai. [11] &amp;ldquo;Oy, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Co 6:17-18 Therefore, come out from among them, and be separate, says Adonai. Touch no unclean thing. Then I will take you in. [18] I will be a father to you, and you shall be My sons and daughters, says Adonai-Tzva&amp;rsquo;ot.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 18:4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recalls Jesus warning His people to flee when destruction is coming:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luk 21:20-22 &amp;ldquo;But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near. [21] Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are inside the city depart, and let not those who are out in the country enter it, [22] for these are days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early Christian historians Eusebius and Epiphanes both attested Christians in Jerusalem in 66 CE escaped to cities beyond Jordan as Jerusalem was being surrounded by the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-185&#34;&gt;Rev 18:5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;For her sins have piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;God remembered&amp;rdquo; is an interesting phrase in the Bible. It speaks of fulfilling a promise or a covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God&amp;rsquo;s justice is delayed (from our perspective) but his patience is not infinite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Genesis 15 when God promised Abraham the land and offspring, there was a problem. The land God promised was at present, occupied by pagans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God had to clarify the terms. It was promised to Abraham but Abraham would not be the one to inherit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, God predicted that they would be sent into slavery and be delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15:16 &amp;ldquo;And they shall come back here in the fourth generation, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidently, God has a finite limit on national sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another interesting story recorded in 2 Kings when Hilkiah finds the book of the law in the Temple where it has presumably been forgotten and disregarded. (it&amp;rsquo;s long but a good story):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Ki 22:11-20 When the king (Josiah) heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his clothes. [12] And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the secretary, and Asaiah the king&amp;rsquo;s servant, saying, [13] &amp;ldquo;Go, inquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found. For great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.&amp;rdquo; [14] So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter), and they talked with her. [15] And she said to them, &amp;ldquo;Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: &amp;lsquo;Tell the man who sent you to me, [16] Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will bring disaster upon this place and upon its inhabitants, all the words of the book that the king of Judah has read. [17] Because they have forsaken me and have made offerings to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath will be kindled against this place, and it will not be quenched. [18] But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall you say to him, Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Regarding the words that you have heard, [19] because your heart was penitent, and you humbled yourself before the LORD, when you heard how I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and you have torn your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you, declares the LORD. [20] Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not see all the disaster that I will bring upon this place.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; And they brought back word to the king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the punishment was already set in motion. It was too late to stop, BUT the judgment (by the way, at the hands of Babylon) won&amp;rsquo;t happen in Josiah&amp;rsquo;s lifetime. It would be delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same thing is happening with Babylon. Judgment is inevitable &amp;ndash; get out while you can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-186&#34;&gt;Rev 18:6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Pay her back just as she has paid out, and give her back double for her deeds! In the cup she has mixed&amp;mdash;mix a double dose for her!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jer 50:29 &amp;ldquo;Summon archers against Babylon, all those who bend the bow. Encamp around her; let no one escape. Repay her according to her deeds; do to her according to all that she has done. For she has proudly defied the LORD, the Holy One of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obadiah 15 For the day of the LORD is near upon all the nations. As you have done, it shall be done to you; your deeds shall return on your own head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 137:1-9 By the waters of Babylon, there we sat down and wept, when we remembered Zion. [2] On the willows there we hung up our lyres. [3] For there our captors required of us songs, and our tormentors, mirth, saying, &amp;ldquo;Sing us one of the songs of Zion!&amp;rdquo; [4] How shall we sing the LORD&amp;rsquo;s song in a foreign land? [5] If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill! [6] Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth, if I do not remember you, if I do not set Jerusalem above my highest joy! [7] Remember, O LORD, against the Edomites the day of Jerusalem, how they said, &amp;ldquo;Lay it bare, lay it bare, down to its foundations!&amp;rdquo; [8] O daughter of Babylon, doomed to be destroyed, blessed shall he be who repays you with what you have done to us! [9] Blessed shall he be who takes your little ones and dashes them against the rock!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measure for measure &amp;ndash; pay her back for how she has treated God&amp;rsquo;s people, God&amp;rsquo;s city, and God&amp;rsquo;s temple. Remember all these apply to both ancient Babylon and ancient Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-187&#34;&gt;Rev 18:7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;As she has exalted herself and indulged herself in luxury, so give her the same measure of torment and grief! For in her heart she says, &amp;lsquo;I sit as a queen&amp;mdash;I am no widow; I shall never see grief.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting choice of words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stands in contrast to Jerusalem in Lamentations 1:1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lam 1:1 How lonely sits the city that was full of people! How like a widow has she become, she who was great among the nations! She who was a princess among the provinces has become a slave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, Jerusalem&amp;rsquo;s widowhood came at the hands of the Babylonians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 47:5-9 Sit in silence, and go into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans (i.e. Babylon); for you shall no more be called the mistress of kingdoms. [6] I was angry with my people; I profaned my heritage; I gave them into your hand; you showed them no mercy; on the aged you made your yoke exceedingly heavy. [7] You said, &amp;ldquo;I shall be mistress forever,&amp;rdquo; so that you did not lay these things to heart or remember their end. [8] Now therefore hear this, you lover of pleasures, who sit securely, who say in your heart, &amp;ldquo;I am, and there is no one besides me; I shall not sit as a widow or know the loss of children&amp;rdquo;: [9] These two things shall come to you in a moment, in one day; the loss of children and widowhood shall come upon you in full measure, in spite of your many sorceries and the great power of your enchantments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God used Babylon as an instrument of punishment for Israel, but then they turned around and mistreated His people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps like Satan with Job, God placed limits on the affliction Babylon was allowed to impose. When they exceeded those limits all bets were off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Daniel 4, the Bible portrays Nebuchadnezzar as relatively friendly to Daniel and presumably the Jews at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Daniel 5, Nebuchadnezzar&amp;rsquo;s grandson, Belshazzar blasphemed the holy implements of the Temple; that night his kingdom was taken from him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, Rome&amp;rsquo;s luxury came at the expense of its heavily taxed subjects. For example, the peasant farmers in Egypt fed the masses of Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-188-10&#34;&gt;Rev 18:8-10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;For this reason her plagues will arrive in a single day&amp;mdash;death and grief and famine&amp;mdash;and she shall be burned down with fire. For mighty is Adonai Elohim who judges her! Then the kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality and indulged in luxury with her shall weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning&amp;mdash;standing far off because of the terror of her torment, saying: &amp;ldquo;Alas, alas, O great city&amp;mdash;O Babylon, the mighty city! For in a single hour your judgment has come!&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We noted last time that ancient Babylon fell relatively peacefully to the Persians in a single night (Dan 5:30).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revived Babylon is going to have a much more spectacular ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke last time about how burning with fire was the punishment for the daughter of a priest who played the harlot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 17:16 And the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast will hate the prostitute. They will make her desolate and naked, and devour her flesh and burn her up with fire,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-1811&#34;&gt;Rev 18:11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;11 And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her, because no one buys their merchandise anymore&amp;mdash;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 23 and Ezekiel 27 go into detail about the luxury trade of Tyre (the other city besides Babylon that represented the Satan) followed by the collapse of said trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verses 12-16 tend to focus more on Babylon&amp;rsquo;s luxury items and less on essentials like flour and wheat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-1812&#34;&gt;Rev 18:12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;12 shipments of gold, silver, precious stones, and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk, and scarlet; all kinds of citron wood; all kinds of ivory products; all kinds of products made of costly wood, bronze, iron, and marble, cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, and frankincense; wine, oil, fine flour, and wheat; cattle, sheep, horses, and chariots; and slaves&amp;mdash;that is, human souls.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;28 items (7 x 4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These items came primarily from northern Africa, Phoenicia, China, and Arabia &amp;ndash; as it is today with most of the goods we consume (phones for example), the locals overseas who do the bulk of the work are paid pennies, while the middlemen make huge margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;rsquo;s one aspect that is clear and consistent about God is that He is concerned for the rights of the poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-1814-15&#34;&gt;Rev 18:14-15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;14 The fruit of your soul&amp;rsquo;s desire has gone from you, and all the expensive and beautiful things are lost to you&amp;mdash;never again will people find them. 15 The merchants of these things, who became rich from her, shall stand far off for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eze 26:17-18 And they will raise a lamentation over you (Tyre) and say to you, &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;How you have perished, you who were inhabited from the seas, O city renowned, who was mighty on the sea; she and her inhabitants imposed their terror on all her inhabitants! [18] Now the coastlands tremble on the day of your fall, and the coastlands that are on the sea are dismayed at your passing.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-1816-18&#34;&gt;Rev 18:16-18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;16 saying, &amp;ldquo;Alas, alas, O great city&amp;mdash;clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls! 17 For in a single hour so much wealth has been ruined!&amp;rdquo; And every ship captain and passenger, sailors and all who make their living at sea, stood at a distance 18 and were crying out, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, &amp;lsquo;What city is like the great city?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rome was the most powerful city the world had ever seen; arguably until London and New York in the industrial revolution, the world had never seen such a city since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a total market collapse without any trading halt safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an example of &amp;ldquo;hitting them where it hurts&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; in the wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-1819&#34;&gt;Rev 18:19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;19 And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, weeping and mourning, &amp;ldquo;Alas, alas, O great city&amp;mdash;in her all who had ships at sea grew rich from her wealth! For in a single hour has she been ruined!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merchants in that day were highly leveraged, as most companies are today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They now have massive debt with no income &amp;ndash; they would have lost everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-1820&#34;&gt;Rev 18:20&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;20 Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you kedoshim, emissaries and prophets! For God has judged her condemnation of you!&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first mention of rejoicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judgment of the wicked is vindication for the righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a turnabout of Rome&amp;rsquo;s judgment on the Christians and Jews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-1821&#34;&gt;Rev 18:21&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;21 Then a mighty angel picked up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying: &amp;ldquo;So shall Babylon, the great city, be thrown down with violence, never to be found again!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jer 51:63-64 When you finish reading this book, tie a stone to it and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates, [64] and say, &amp;lsquo;Thus shall Babylon sink, to rise no more, because of the disaster that I am bringing upon her, and they shall become exhausted.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus used similar imagery in Matthew 18:6:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An olive press (by the way, the name for an olive press is gat-Sh&amp;rsquo;manim&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Gethsemane&amp;rdquo;) was a stone mill for grinding olives into pulp to extract the oil. Millstones were large circular stones with a hole in the middle. One would stick a pole in the stone and typically attach the other end to a donkey. The donkey would walk around in a circle as the stone would crush the olives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average diameter of a normal millstone was about five feet (the one in the picture is actually small by comparison). In any case, one would sink very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that Jesus was not making an idle threat in the Gospels. In Revelation, the Babylon world system that causes little ones who believe in him to sin will receive the prescribed punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-1822&#34;&gt;Rev 18:22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;And the sound of harpists and musicians, flautists and trumpeters, shall never be heard in you again! And the craftsman of any craft shall never be found in you again! And the sound of a mill shall never be heard in you again!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the city is without any people living in it at all, much less those enjoying life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beasts and other unclean creatures (verse 2) have moved in as described in Isaiah 13 and 34.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an interesting parallel with the millstone never to be found again and the sound of a mill never to be heard again;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the phrase &amp;ldquo;never&amp;hellip;again&amp;rdquo; occurs six times in this chapter. Man&amp;rsquo;s hour is passing away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is in contrast with the actual fall of ancient Babylon in 539 BCE, which was without a battle. Babylon was eventually one of Alexander the Great&amp;rsquo;s capitals (a far cry from never heard from again).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-1823&#34;&gt;Rev 18:23&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;23 And the light of a lamp shall never shine in you again! And the voice of the bridegroom and bride shall never be heard in you again! For your businessmen were the tycoons of the world, for all the nations were deceived by your sorcery!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jer 7:34&lt;/strong&gt;  And I will silence in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, for the land shall become a waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idioms are interesting. As illustrations to make the point that life as usual is coming to an end, we have marriage and business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus used those exact two illustrations to say it will be life as usual when the Son of Man comes and things will change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luk 17:26-29 Just as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of Man. [27] They were eating and drinking and &lt;strong&gt;marrying and being given in marriage&lt;/strong&gt;, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. [28] Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lot&amp;mdash;they were eating and drinking, &lt;strong&gt;buying and selling, planting and building&lt;/strong&gt;, [29] but on the day when Lot went out from Sodom, fire and sulfur rained from heaven and destroyed them all&amp;mdash;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-1824&#34;&gt;Rev 18:24&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;24 And in her was found the blood of the prophets and kedoshim and all those slaughtered on the earth.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can trace the path of the blood of the saints throughout Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 6:10 They cried out with a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before you will judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 16:6 For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. It is what they deserve!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 17:6 And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints, the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I marveled greatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 18:24&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 19:2 for his judgments are true and just; for he has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her immorality, and has avenged on her the blood of his servants.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all righteous were killed in the city of Rome but God assigned the responsibility of their slaughter to Rome by virtue of being an oppressive empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From J. Vernon McGee: &amp;ldquo;The Babylon of chapter 17 is ecclesiastical &amp;ndash; the apostate church. The Babylon of chapter 18 is economic. While the religious system is hated by the kings, the commercial center is LOVED by the kings of the earth.&amp;rdquo; As is the general theme of the book, the call for believers is to hold fast and remain pure. We need to look for areas in our lives where we might have compromised and get right before Jesus comes back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;people-get-ready-jesus-is-coming&#34;&gt;People get ready; Jesus is coming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Luk 1:30-33 And the angel said to her, &amp;ldquo;Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. [31] And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. [32] He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, [33] and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a section we read every Christmas, but we may not give it much thought beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we really take this promise seriously? After all, the throne of David did not exist in Jesus&amp;rsquo; time and it hasn&amp;rsquo;t since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to see it fulfilled in Chapter 19 (remember the prophetic past tense: something so sure that we can say it is done even though it hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll see you next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_2d43nLIImg&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;revelation-19&#34;&gt;Revelation 19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;After these things, I heard what sounded like the roar of a huge crowd in heaven, shouting, &amp;ldquo;Hallelujah! The victory, the glory, the power of our God! For his judgments are true and just. He has judged the great whore who corrupted the earth with her whoring. He has taken vengeance on her who has the blood of his servants on her hands.&amp;rdquo; And a second time, they said, &amp;ldquo;Hallelujah! Her smoke goes up forever and ever!&amp;rdquo; The twenty-four elders and the four living beings fell down and worshipped God, sitting on the throne, and said, &amp;ldquo;Amen! Hallelujah!&amp;rdquo; A voice went out from the throne, saying, &amp;ldquo;Praise our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, small and great!&amp;rdquo; Then I heard what sounded like the roar of a huge crowd, like the sound of rushing waters, like loud peals of thunder, saying, &amp;ldquo;halleluiah! Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, has begun his reign! &amp;ldquo;Let us rejoice and be glad! Let us give him the glory! For the time has come for the wedding of the Lamb, and his Bride has prepared herself&amp;mdash; fine linen, bright and clean, has been given her to wear.&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;Fine linen&amp;rdquo; means the righteous deeds of God&amp;rsquo;s people.) The angel said to me, &amp;ldquo;Write: &amp;lsquo;How blessed are those who have been invited to the wedding feast of the Lamb!&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; Then he added, &amp;ldquo;These are God&amp;rsquo;s very words.&amp;rdquo; I fell at his feet to worship him, but he said, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t do that! I&amp;rsquo;m only a fellow servant with you and your brothers who have the testimony of Yeshua. Worship God! For the testimony of Yeshua is the Spirit of prophecy.&amp;rdquo; Next, I saw heaven opened, and there before me was a white horse. Sitting on it was the one called Faithful and True, and it is in righteousness that he passes judgment and goes to battle. His eyes were like a fiery flame, and on his head were many royal crowns. And he had a name written which no one knew but himself. He was wearing a robe that had been soaked in blood, and the name by which he is called is, &amp;ldquo;THE WORD OF GOD.&amp;rdquo; The armies of heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and pure, were following him on white horses. And out of his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down nations&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;He will rule them with a staff of iron.&amp;rdquo; It is he who treads the winepress from which flows the wine of the furious rage of Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies. And on his robe and on his thigh, he has a name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS. Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out in a loud voice to all the birds that fly about in mid-heaven, &amp;ldquo;Come, gather together for the great feast God is giving, to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of generals, the flesh of important men, the flesh of horses and their riders and the flesh of all kinds of people, free and slave, small and great!&amp;rdquo; I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to do battle with the rider of the horse and his army. But the beast was taken captive and with it the false prophet who, in its presence, had done the miracles which he had used to deceive those who had received the mark of the beast and those who had worshipped his image. The beast and the false prophet were both thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur. The rest were killed with the sword that goes out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;parable-of-the-wedding-feast-and-wedding-clothes----matthew-221-14&#34;&gt;Parable of the wedding feast and wedding clothes &amp;ndash; Matthew 22:1-14&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mat 22:1-14 And again Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying, [2] &amp;ldquo;The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son, [3] and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come. [4] Again he sent other servants, saying, &amp;lsquo;Tell those who are invited, &amp;ldquo;See, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo; [5] But they paid no attention and went off, one to his farm, another to his business, [6] while the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them. [7] The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. [8] Then he said to his servants, &amp;lsquo;The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy. [9] Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.&amp;rsquo; [10] And those servants went out into the roads and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests. [11] &amp;ldquo;But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding garment. [12] And he said to him, &amp;lsquo;Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?&amp;rsquo; And he was speechless. [13] Then the king said to the attendants, &amp;lsquo;Bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness. In that place, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&amp;rsquo; [14] For many are called, but few are chosen.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a parable within a parable; we have the overall wedding banquet and then a parable of the wrong clothes nested inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parable of the dinner invitation (Mt 22:1-14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King = God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wedding banquet = the messianic banquet in Revelation 19&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Servants calling = the prophets and Yeshua issuing a call to repent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those invited = those who heard the call (but did not necessarily respond to it)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excuses = deceits of wealth and materialism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Killing the servants = murdering the prophets and Yeshua&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burned their city = the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad and Good = sinners, tax collectors, prostitutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning: those who do not repent will face punishment in this world and lose their place in the messianic banquet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parable of the wrong clothes (Mt 22:2, 10-14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this parable parallels the Talmud attributed to Yochanan ben Zakkai, a contemporary of Jesus. Could Zakkai have been in the crowd when Jesus gave the teaching?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King = God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wedding banquet = messianic banquet in Revelation 19&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guests &amp;ndash; those who enter the kingdom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garments = righteous deeds, including repentance and keeping Jesus&amp;rsquo; commands (so &amp;ldquo;no garments&amp;rdquo; is a lack of repentance and deeds)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outer darkness = Gehenna&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning: an invitation to the banquet does not guarantee a place at the table. We must respond to the invitation with repentance and righteous deeds done in His power, not our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rejoicing-in-heaven&#34;&gt;Rejoicing in Heaven&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-191-commanded-to-praise&#34;&gt;Rev 19:1 Commanded to Praise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;After this, I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, crying out, &amp;ldquo;Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God,&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 104:35 Let sinners be consumed from the earth, and let the wicked be no more! Bless the LORD, O my soul! Praise the LORD!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is another Meta Tauta &amp;ndash; a scene shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verses 1-5 could be placed with Chapter 18 &amp;ndash; while there is mourning on earth, there is rejoicing in heaven. The martyrs have been vindicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallelujah is a Hebrew word Hallel &amp;ndash; Praise; u &amp;ndash; you plural; yah &amp;ndash; short for YHWH &amp;ndash; Adonai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grammatically it&amp;rsquo;s an imperative in the Hebrew piel form &amp;ndash; intensive, emphatic command to praise and worship God for his magnificent acts!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears four times in the first six verses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The massive crowd in heaven praises God for taking down Babylon and assuming control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-192-redeemer-of-blood&#34;&gt;Rev 19:2 Redeemer of Blood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;for his judgments are true and just; for he has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her immorality and has avenged on her the blood of his servants.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 19:9 the fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; the rules of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deu 32:43 &amp;ldquo;Rejoice with him, O heavens; bow down to him, all gods, for he avenges the blood of his children and takes vengeance on his adversaries. He repays those who hate him and cleanses his people&amp;rsquo;s land.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Ki 9:7 And you shall strike down the house of Ahab, your master, so that I may avenge on Jezebel the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Num 35:19 The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death; when he meets him, he shall put him to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In capital cases, the design was for the guilt/innocence to be judged in an orderly trial; if guilty, it fell to the avenger of blood to execute the guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, the phrase is &amp;ldquo;goel Haddam.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;goel is the same word for a redeemer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is our Goel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a real sense, the seals, trumpets, and bowls were God&amp;rsquo;s trial for the earth-dwellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were guilty and Jesus our Goel, our redeemer, did precisely what the Law required Him to do. Remember, He came not to abolish but to fulfill the Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fulfills prophecy: Jer 51:48-49 Then the heavens and the earth, and all that is in them, shall sing for joy over Babylon, for the destroyers shall come against them out of the north, declares the LORD. [49] Babylon must fall for the slain of Israel, just as for Babylon have fallen the slain of all the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, a response to Revelation 18:20 &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Rejoice over her&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are forbidden to take revenge ourselves (Romans 12:19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would recommend we generally not gloat over the downfall of our enemies, but if God commands it, go for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the definitive reference to the blood of the saints, a recurring motif throughout the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 6:10 They cried out with a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before you will judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 16:6 For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. It is what they deserve!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 17:6 And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints, the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I marveled greatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 18:24 And in her was found the blood of the prophets and kedoshim and all those slaughtered on the earth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 19:2 for his judgments are true and just; for he has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her immorality, and has avenged on her the blood of his servants.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-193-smoke-forever&#34;&gt;Rev 19:3 Smoke forever&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Once more, they cried out, &amp;ldquo;Hallelujah! The smoke from her goes up forever and ever.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 34:10 Night and day it shall not be quenched; its smoke shall go up forever. From generation to generation, it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it forever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This speaks of Edom but applies to all cities that practice wickedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imagery recalls the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis 19&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-194-5-praising-from-the-heavenly-throne&#34;&gt;Rev 19:4-5 Praising from the Heavenly Throne.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who was seated on the throne, saying, &amp;ldquo;Amen. Hallelujah!&amp;rdquo; And from the throne came a voice saying, &amp;ldquo;Praise our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, small and great.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 106:48 Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! And let all the people say, &amp;ldquo;Amen!&amp;rdquo; Praise the LORD!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 115:12-13 The LORD has remembered us; he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron; [13] he will bless those who fear the LORD, both the small and the great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavenly throne room imagery as we looked at in Isaiah 6 and Ezekiel 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Heiser&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;ldquo;The Unseen Realm&amp;rdquo; is an excellent resource on God&amp;rsquo;s divine council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-196-our-god-reigns&#34;&gt;Rev 19:6 Our God Reigns!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;6 Then I heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude, like the roar of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, crying out, &amp;ldquo;Hallelujah! For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ps 97:1 The LORD reigns, let the earth rejoice; let the many coastlands be glad!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exodus 15:18 The LORD will reign forever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 52:7 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace, who brings good news of happiness, who publishes salvation, who says to Zion, &amp;ldquo;Your God reigns.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eze 1:24 And when they went, I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of many waters, like the sound of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of an army. When they stood still, they let down their wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eze 43:2 And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east. And the sound of his coming was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone with his glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I first became a Christian, I saw Amy Grant at the L.A. Forum in 1989 &amp;ndash; before the concert, one side of the building chanted, &amp;ldquo;We love Jesus, yes we do, we love Jesus, how &amp;lsquo;bout you?&amp;rdquo; and then the other side would respond in kind. I imagine something like that is going on here. The Martyrs give praise, which causes the elders to praise, which causes the throne, and then the great multitude to praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of music, Handel&amp;rsquo;s famous Hallelujah Chorus comes from Revelation 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-197-well-aged-wine&#34;&gt;Rev 19:7 Well-aged Wine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;7 Let us rejoice and exult and give him the glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his Bride has made herself ready; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jewish tradition, the messianic age was often portrayed as a wedding banquet, with God as the Groom and His called-out people as the bride. See Isa 54:1-8, Isa 62:4-5; Jer 31:31-32.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exo 19:14-15 So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and consecrated the people; and they washed their garments. [15] And he said to the people, &amp;ldquo;Be ready for the third day; do not go near a woman.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 25:6-9 On this mountain, the LORD of hosts will make for all peoples a feast of rich food, a feast of well-aged wine, of rich food full of marrow, of aged wine well refined. [7] And he will swallow up on this mountain the covering that is cast over all peoples, the veil that is spread over all nations. [8] He will swallow up death forever, and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from all faces, and the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for the LORD has spoken. [9] It will be said on that day, &amp;ldquo;Behold, this is our God; we have waited for him, that he might save us. This is the LORD; we have waited for him; let us be glad and rejoice in his salvation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us rejoice in our salvation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us also remain a pure, spotless bride, undefiled by and separated from the things of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar Apostolic imagery of the Messiah as the bridegroom and the inauguration of the Kingdom as a wedding is also found in Mat 22:1-14, Mat 25:1-13; Mar 2:18-20; Joh 3:28-30; Rom 7:1-4; 1 Co 6:13-20; 2 Co 11:2 and Eph 5:25-33.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-198----righteous-deeds&#34;&gt;Rev 19:8 &amp;ndash; Righteous Deeds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;it was granted her to clothe herself with fine linen, bright and pure&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash; for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White fine linen evokes the High Priest&amp;rsquo;s garments for entering the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a definite contrast with the elegant dress of the harlot in Revelation 17:4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lev 16:4 He shall put on the holy linen coat and shall have the linen undergarment on his body, and he shall tie the linen sash around his waist, and wear the linen turban; these are the holy garments. He shall bathe his body in water and then put them on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note what the fine linen represents here &amp;ndash; the righteous deeds of the saints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, I thought &amp;ldquo;all my righteous deeds were as filthy rags&amp;rdquo; (Isaiah 64:6)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This verse has been overused, likely pollution from the Enemy, to keep us from being the most effective for God&amp;rsquo;s service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific context of Isaiah 64 is using deeds specifically with the intent &lt;em&gt;to motivate God to move in our favor&lt;/em&gt;. Unlike the pagan gods, our God does not need to be bribed or coerced into action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a far cry from saying every good deed is filthy, with the often unspoken assumption that we should not even bother to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In direct contrast to this misteaching is the Bible, which commands us to uphold the highest ethical standards of good deeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some might say the linen is not our deeds but God&amp;rsquo;s righteousness imputed (transferred) to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes and no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, because that&amp;rsquo;s not what the verse says. The linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But indirectly, yes, because we know we can only come to the Father through faith in Jesus by trusting in his death and resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This saving faith MUST necessarily translate into righteous deeds. This is what the book of James is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jas 1:25 But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t do righteous deeds to get saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do righteous deeds BECAUSE we ARE saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, in some sense, we earn &amp;ldquo;spiritual points&amp;rdquo; in heaven for our good deeds as long as our motivation is from selfless love for others and not a selfish &amp;ldquo;look at me&amp;rdquo; standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 6:1-4 &amp;ldquo;Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. [2] &amp;ldquo;Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that others may praise them. Truly, I say to you; they have received their reward. [3] But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, [4] so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus doesn&amp;rsquo;t say, &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t give to the needy because your righteous deeds are as filthy rags.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says WHEN you give to the needy, do so humbly and without expectation of praise by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-199-you-must-be-invited-to-the-feast&#34;&gt;Rev 19:9 You must be invited to the feast.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;9 And the angel said to me, &amp;ldquo;Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.&amp;rdquo; And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;These are the true words of God.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continues theme of Isaiah 25:6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a more profound theological truth is at play here &amp;ndash; you can&amp;rsquo;t invite yourself to the feast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible, notably Romans, says we are dead in our sins. A dead person can&amp;rsquo;t wake up on his own. So to be saved means God has to save you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible supports this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible also clearly supports those who will be at the great supper in Rev 19:17, where the birds of the air feast on the flesh of all men who choose to be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a contradiction from our perspective. If you&amp;rsquo;re saved, it&amp;rsquo;s only by His grace; if you&amp;rsquo;re not saved, it&amp;rsquo;s because you chose to reject God&amp;rsquo;s way. (Be a Berean and test this theory against the Bible).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1910-only-one-angel-allowed-himself-to-be-worshipped&#34;&gt;Rev 19:10 Only one angel allowed himself to be worshipped.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;10 Then I fell at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, &amp;ldquo;You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God.&amp;rdquo; For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 2:18 Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, going on in detail about visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We worship &lt;strong&gt;with&lt;/strong&gt; the angels, not the angels themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another stamp of authentication &amp;ndash; if you and I were writing a book, we might be tempted to omit the times when we worshipped other beings besides God. There has been a fine line between the angel as the mouthpiece of the Messiah and the Messiah Himself. Here we are reminded that there is a distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one angel insisted on being worshipped, and, by the end of the chapter, he&amp;rsquo;ll be in much trouble. Today&amp;rsquo;s faith healers would do well to take notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interpretation of the last sentence is that all prophecy centers around the person of Jesus. Even the prophecies of the nations in Daniel 7 relate to Jesus&amp;rsquo; returning to reclaim His rightful throne. Trying to discern what will happen next week or next year is not prophecy; it&amp;rsquo;s fortune-telling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-rider-on-a-white-horse&#34;&gt;The Rider on a White Horse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1911-faithful-true-and-righteous&#34;&gt;Rev 19:11 Faithful, True, and Righteous&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;11 Then I saw &lt;strong&gt;heaven opened&lt;/strong&gt;, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness, he judges and makes war.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eze 1:1 In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the exiles by the Chebar canal, &lt;strong&gt;the heavens were opened&lt;/strong&gt;, and I saw visions of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second coming! Titus 2:13 waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeshua has been given the authority to judge: John 5:22 For the Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faithful and true&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 3:14 &amp;ldquo;And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write: &amp;lsquo;The words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of God&amp;rsquo;s creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jer 42:5 Then they said to Jeremiah, &amp;ldquo;May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act according to all the word with which the LORD your God sends you to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re reminded that while the preceding judgments are severe, the punishments are from a wholly (with a w) just God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 42:13 The LORD goes out like a mighty man, like a man of war he stirs up his zeal; he cries out, he shouts aloud, he shows himself mighty against his foes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keener &amp;ldquo;The image may allude to God going forth as a warrior on behalf of his people (e.g., Isa 31:4; Isa 42:13; Isa 59:16-18; Hab 3:11-13; Zec 14:3; cf. Exo 15:3). This is the ultimate &amp;ldquo;holy war,&amp;rdquo; anticipated in the Old Testament, in the Dead Sea Scrolls, by the Zealots, and by other Jewish people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talmud 98a: Rabbi Alexandri says: Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi raises a contradiction between two depictions of the coming Messiah. It is written: &amp;ldquo;There came with the clouds of heaven, one like unto a son of man&amp;hellip;and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom&amp;hellip;his dominion is an everlasting dominion&amp;rdquo; (Daniel 7:13&amp;ndash;14). And it is written: &amp;ldquo;Behold, your king will come to you; he is just and victorious; lowly and riding upon a donkey and upon a colt, the foal of a donkey&amp;rdquo; (Zechariah 9:9). Rabbi Alexandri explains: If the Jewish people merit redemption, the Messiah will come miraculously with the clouds of heaven. If they do not merit redemption, the Messiah will come lowly and riding upon a donkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1912-a-name-no-one-knows&#34;&gt;Rev 19:12 A name no one knows.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems, and he has a name written that no one knows but himself.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several references to Revelation 1-2, including Rev 2:17 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers, I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, with a new name written on the stone that no one knows except the one who receives it.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;name no one knows&amp;rdquo; could be a stylistic way of saying no one has any power over Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we saw with the demoniac at Gadera, the ancients believed that if you could name the demon, you then had the power to exorcise it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancient pagan magicians claimed they could coerce spirits once they knew their names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eyes like a fiery flame references Rev 1:14 and Dan 10:6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1913-14-robe-dipped-in-blood&#34;&gt;Rev 19:13-14 Robe dipped in blood.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;13 He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is The Word of God. And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, were following him on white horses.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 63:2-3 Why is Your apparel red and your garments like his who treads in the winepress? [3] &amp;ldquo;I have trodden the winepress alone, and from the peoples, no one was with me; I trod them in my anger and trampled them in my wrath; their lifeblood spattered on my garments and stained all my apparel. [4] For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and my year of redemption had come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jud 1:14-15 It was also about these that Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, &amp;ldquo;Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his holy ones, [15] to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all their deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare also Revelation 14:17:20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is fair to interpret this as the blood of Jesus&amp;rsquo; enemies, but Lancaster has a different theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 5:6 And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders I saw a Lamb standing, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;as though it had been slain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, with seven horns and with seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if the blood on His robe is HIS OWN BLOOD, by which He is able to remove the stain from our clothing and make our deeds righteous?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on that for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are with Jesus, somehow, we will be conscious that He suffered a brutal death on a hill outside Jerusalem about 2000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll have an eternity to reflect on that your sin and my sin caused His suffering &amp;ndash; though it likely will not be from a position of shame but eternal gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to interpret this as the blood of the Martyrs. Most commentators opt for believing it is the blood of Jesus&amp;rsquo; enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1915-strike-with-a-rod-of-iron&#34;&gt;Rev 19:15 strike with a rod of Iron&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 49:2 He made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand he hid me; he made me a polished arrow; in his quiver, he hid me away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosea 6:5 Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth, and my judgment goes forth as the light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 11:4 but with righteousness, he shall judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth; and he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sword was Rome&amp;rsquo;s symbol of absolute authority over life and death (as it is for Islam today); in the Bible, the sword is an image of God&amp;rsquo;s judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1916-king-of-kings-lord-of-lords-forever-and-ever&#34;&gt;Rev 19:16 King of Kings, Lord of Lords, forever and ever.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;16 On his robe and on his thigh, he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deu 10:17 For the LORD, your God, is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who is not partial and takes no bribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Sam 24:4 And the men of David said to him, &amp;ldquo;Here is the day of which the LORD said to you, &amp;lsquo;Behold, I will give your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; Then David arose and stealthily cut off a corner (hem) of Saul&amp;rsquo;s robe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is unlikely to speak of a tattoo, as marring the body in such a fashion is forbidden by Jewish law. People are not to be branded as cattle - Lev 19:28 You shall not make any cuts on your body for the dead or tattoo yourselves: I am the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could refer to the robe&amp;rsquo;s hem, which was often the location of military rank and insignia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hem symbolized authority, which is why David&amp;rsquo;s cutting off Saul&amp;rsquo;s hem is significant on several levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus has ultimate authority over all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, we could ask whether He is the King and Lord over your life; or have you accepted the free gift but not truly submitted it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-birds-feast&#34;&gt;The Birds&amp;rsquo; Feast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1917-18-which-lords-supper-will-you-be-attending&#34;&gt;Rev 19:17-18 Which &amp;ldquo;Lord&amp;rsquo;s Supper&amp;rdquo; will you be attending?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice, he called to all the birds that fly directly overhead, &amp;ldquo;Come, gather for the great supper of God, to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, both small and great.&amp;quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the actual battle of Armageddon referenced in Chapter 16. It may be in the Jezreel valley, but other passages reference the &amp;ldquo;Valley of Jehoshaphat,&amp;rdquo; which is generally considered in Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a symbol, birds (other than the Eagle) are almost always bad news in the Bible. They are the ministers of Satan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eze 39:17 &amp;ldquo;As for you, son of man, thus says the Lord GOD: Speak to the birds of every sort and to all beasts of the field: &amp;lsquo;Assemble and come, gather from all around to the sacrificial feast that I am preparing for you, a great sacrificial feast on the mountains of Israel, and you shall eat flesh and drink blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The imagery of Revelation 19 is taken from Ezekiel 39, commonly known as the Magog Invasion. There is a bit of textual tension as we are at the beginning of the 1000 years; Revelation does not mention Gog and Magog until Revelation 20:8 after the millennium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen 15:11 And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 13:4 And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them. Mat 13:19 When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, &lt;strong&gt;the evil one&lt;/strong&gt; comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s curious that for fish and land animals, God provided categories of clean and unclean. Fish had fins and scales; animals had to chew the cud and part the hoof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birds, however, get a specific list by the name of those the Israelites are to consider detestable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unclean birds all have in common that they are flesh-eaters/scavengers/birds of prey. These are the birds circling in Rev 19:17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seed or insect eaters such as fowl (ducks, quail, chicken, turkey, pheasant, etc.) are not listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recall the general mission of the book we learned at the beginning of our study: &amp;ldquo;although things are bad now, hold fast. The LORD sees all and will vindicate the suffering of His saints.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate symbol of being vanquished is not being given a proper burial but instead letting the bodies be food for scavenger birds. Such words would have been a powerful encouragement to the persecuted Christians reading and hearing Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earlier in the book, Jesus mentioned Jezebel, who suffered a similar disgraceful (yet deserved) death by scavenger animals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Clean and unclean food&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about the Jewish dietary laws, it&amp;rsquo;s good to remember there are three categories, not two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;unclean animals (not food);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;clean animals that are slaughtered or prepared improperly (unclean food); and,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;clean animals prepared properly (clean food).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To an orthodox Jew, pork is not food at all, beef that is slaughtered by gunshot or found dead on the road is unclean food, not to be eaten; a cow that has its carotid artery severed with a super sharp knife and is allowed to bleed out painlessly is clean food and can be eaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Peter&amp;rsquo;s own admission, the vision of the unclean animals in Acts 10 has nothing to do with food or removing dietary laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Acts 11:12, Peter says the spirit told him to make no distinction between Jews and Gentiles. The vision meant that Peter could now meet with Gentiles to preach and teach the gospel (far more significant than whether one should or should not eat pork).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cornelius and the others were &amp;ldquo;God-fearers&amp;rdquo; (Acts 10:2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A God-fearer was a particular class of Gentile who attached to the God of Israel but did not formally convert to Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God-fearers such as Cornelius &lt;em&gt;ate according to the Jewish dietary laws&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man-made tradition had arisen that Jews were not to eat with gentiles, even God-fearing Gentiles. Although, in some sense, it is an understandable conclusion, it is nowhere in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus previously forbid the disciples to teach the gentiles (Matthew 10:5-7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel was for Israel first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the resurrection, the door was opened to the Gentiles (Matthew 28:18-20), but both Peter and Paul needed this to be supernaturally explained to them a little more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1919-the-nations-rage&#34;&gt;Rev 19:19 The nations rage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;19 And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against him who was sitting on the horse and against his army.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine the arrogance? &amp;ldquo;Hey, let&amp;rsquo;s go fight God!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, they are being controlled by spiritual instigators (see verse 20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must read Psalm 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 2:1-12 Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain? [2] The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and against his Anointed, saying, [3] &amp;ldquo;Let us burst their bonds apart and cast away their cords from us.&amp;rdquo; [4] He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord holds them in derision. [5] Then he will speak to them in his wrath and terrify them in his fury, saying, [6] &amp;ldquo;As for me, I have set my King on Zion, my holy hill.&amp;rdquo; [7] I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, &amp;ldquo;You are my Son; today I have begotten you. [8] Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage and the ends of the earth your possession. [9] You shall break them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces like a potter&amp;rsquo;s vessel.&amp;rdquo; [10] Now therefore, O kings, be wise; be warned, O rulers of the earth. [11] Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. [12] Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Joel 3:9-17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1920-go-to-the-lake-of-fire-and-fry&#34;&gt;Rev 19:20 Go to the lake of fire and fry.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;20 And the beast was captured and with it the false prophet who in its presence had done the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 25:41 &amp;ldquo;Then he will say to those on his left, &amp;lsquo;Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezekiel 38:22 With pestilence and bloodshed I will enter into judgment with him, and I will rain upon him and his hordes and the many peoples who are with him torrential rains and hailstones, fire and sulfur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 30:33 For a burning place has long been prepared; indeed, for the king, it is made ready, its pyre made deep and wide, with fire and wood in abundance; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of sulfur, kindles it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan 7:11 &amp;ldquo;I looked then because of the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking. And as I looked, the beast was killed, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judgments by fire are standard in Jewish accounts of the end times, though being thrown in alive is unique to John&amp;rsquo;s account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does Satan continue his attacks if he knows the end? He&amp;rsquo;s a madman with nothing to lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fire and sulfur are cited as God&amp;rsquo;s means of punishment and destruction in the days of Sodom (Genesis 19).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relevant other passages on Gehenna and judgment: Mat 3:10-12; Mat 5:22, Mat 5:29-30; Mat 10:28; Luke 12:4-5; Mat 13:40-43; Mat 18:8-9; Mat 23:15, Mat 23:33; Mat 25:46; Mark 9:43; Mark 9:48; Luke 16:23-24; Luke 17:29-30; 2 Th 1:8, Heb 12:29, 2Pe 3:7, Jude 1:7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rev-1921-birds-gorge-on-the-flesh&#34;&gt;Rev 19:21 Birds gorge on the flesh.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;And the rest were slain by the sword from the mouth of him sitting on the horse, and all the birds were gorged with their flesh.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the &amp;ldquo;rest,&amp;rdquo; see verse 18. Although it might seem that only the armies are slaughtered, the people/nations cheering on the armies are also invited for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are given relatively few verses on the exact nature of the millennium and then the new heavens/new earth. It is difficult to piece together a comprehensive picture of what is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that we live in this age (literally in Hebrew Olam HaZeh, this age); we are promised the age to come (Olam Habah) but aren&amp;rsquo;t told much about it except that it will be wonderful. We defer to God&amp;rsquo;s perfect editing and anxiously await to see what will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the sword from His mouth &amp;ndash; one option could be that as the armies are lined up to face each other, Messiah will step forward and speak &amp;ldquo;Death.&amp;rdquo; The power of this word obliterates the opposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fi5_dppqfcE&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;revelation-20&#34;&gt;Revelation 20&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I saw an angel coming down from heaven, who had the key to the Abyss and a great chain in his hand. He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan [the Adversary], and chained him up for a thousand years. He threw him into the Abyss, locked it, and sealed it over him; so that he could not deceive the nations anymore until the thousand years were over. After that, he has to be set free for a little while. Then I saw thrones, and those seated there received authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for testifying about Yeshua and proclaiming the Word of God, also those who had not worshipped the beast or its image and had not received the mark on their foreheads and on their hands. They came to life and ruled with the Messiah for a thousand years. (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were over.) This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is anyone who has a part in the first resurrection; over him, the second death has no power. On the contrary, they will be cohanim of God and of the Messiah, and they will rule with him for the thousand years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the thousand years are over, the Adversary will be set free from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for the battle. Their number is countless as the sand on the seashore, and they came up over the breadth of the Land and surrounded the camp of God&amp;rsquo;s people and the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and consumed them. The Adversary who had deceived them was hurled into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I saw a great white throne and the One sitting on it. Earth and heaven fled from his presence, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, both great and small, standing in front of the throne. Books were opened, and another book was opened, the Book of Life, and the dead were judged from what was written in the books, according to what they had done. The sea gave up the dead in it, and Death and Sh&amp;rsquo;ol gave up the dead in them, and they were judged, each according to what he had done. Then Death and Sh&amp;rsquo;ol were hurled into the lake of fire. This is the second death&amp;mdash;the lake of fire. Anyone whose name was not found written in the Book of Life was hurled into the lake of fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-millennium-eschatology-review&#34;&gt;The Millennium: Eschatology Review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here we encounter the Millennium, the thousand-year reign of Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scholars over the centuries have debated whether this is literal or figurative. This debate results in the fundamental division in eschatology (the study of end times).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amillennialism
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Augustine (mid 4th Century) held that the Millennium was symbolic of the present age, not a literal time period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amillennial is the term we give to this body of thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general, this view says that Jesus isn&amp;rsquo;t literally coming back to earth; He&amp;rsquo;s going to rule in our hearts as the church makes the world a better and better place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amillennialism sees chapter 20 as summarizing all the events in the preceding chapters versus describing a distinct chronological period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cynically, we can trace this belief to the fact that he lived during the time of Constantine when the church was married to the world (see our discussion on the letter to Pergamos).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the church was the ruling and governing authority, it sure would have been politically incorrect to say that Jesus is coming back to rid the world of its evil rulers!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missler believes the two most significant shortcomings of the Protestant reformation are that first, they did not reassess the Church&amp;rsquo;s position concerning Israel (as discussed in Romans 9-11), and second, they did not reassess the Church&amp;rsquo;s position on Amillennialism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a result, Calvin and Luther were staunch Amillennialists, and most protestants and Catholics hold an Amillennial theology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a result, most denominations have very little use for the Book of Revelation, which is generally viewed as a protracted fable of good vs. evil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To them, the warnings in Rev 22:18-19 about not adding or removing anything from the book of &lt;em&gt;prophecy&lt;/em&gt; might be especially chilling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A literal millennium
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In contrast, men who lived before Constantine, during times of persecution, such as Irenaeus and Justin Martyr, viewed Revelation as prophetic of events that will occur in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, there will be a literal reign of Jesus, albeit with some debate over whether the &amp;ldquo;1000 years&amp;rdquo; is literal or figurative for &amp;ldquo;a long time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could call these &amp;ldquo;Millenialists&amp;rdquo; as opposed to Amillennialists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were groups divided into whether Jesus was coming before the Millennium (i.e., premillennialists) or after (i.e., postmillennialists).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postmillennialists are rare these days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This view tends to be a hybrid of premillennialism and amillennialism, with the millennium as the present historical age, which gets better and better until Jesus returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By contrast, most conservative scholars are premillennial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Premillennials are further divided on when they believe the rapture will occur.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See the summary chart below from Chuck Missler.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, while one&amp;rsquo;s belief in the end-times may seem like a non-essential matter &amp;ndash; after all, we can live our life here, and God will take care of the details after we pass &amp;ndash; there is a connection between one&amp;rsquo;s eschatology and one&amp;rsquo;s hermeneutics (how one interprets the Bible.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We closed lesson 18 with Luke 1:32-33 and the promise to Mary that Jesus would sit on the throne of his father David forever. This throne did not exist during Mary&amp;rsquo;s day and does not exist today. If one is Amillennial, he or she is asserting the throne will never exist because Jesus doesn&amp;rsquo;t literally reign. If we take the Bible seriously, we realize that the Davidic covenant was promised to David in 2 Sam 7:11-16 and Isaiah 7:13. It was continuously reaffirmed, promised to Mary, and recognized by the First Church Council in Acts 15:15-18. Act 15:15-18&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;And with this, the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written, [16] &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;After this I will return, and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen; I will rebuild its ruins, and I will restore it, [17] that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles who are called by my name, says the Lord, who makes these things [18] known from of old.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evidence for Premilliannialism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are 1845 references to a future Messianic Ruler in the Hebrew Bible and 318 references in the New Testament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For every prophecy of Jesus&amp;rsquo; 1st Coming, there are eight of His 2nd Coming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Prayer, we pray &amp;ldquo;Thy Kingdom Come&amp;rdquo;; are we serious when we pray this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many Jewish texts describe a period that bridges the present age with the age to come. Most view this as a period of messianic peace.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few early traditions view the millennium as the last of seven 1000-year periods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, 6000 years of man&amp;rsquo;s rule followed by 1000 years of Messiah&amp;rsquo;s rule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this sense, it is a Sabbath rest: 6000 years shall we toil; 1000 years shall we rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amillennial theology would deny all of these.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;connection-with-ezekiel&#34;&gt;Connection with Ezekiel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapters 20 and 21 seem to correlate with the final chapters of Ezekiel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel&amp;rsquo;s resurrection; David ruling &amp;ndash; Ezekiel 36-37 &amp;ndash; Rev 20:1-6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The war with Gog and Magog &amp;ndash; Ezekiel 38-39 &amp;ndash; Rev 20:7-10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Jerusalem&amp;rsquo;s temple &amp;ndash; Ezekiel 40-48 &amp;ndash; Rev 21-22&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some see this temple as being the Millennial Temple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;warning-and-encouragement-from-peter-on-the-last-days&#34;&gt;Warning and encouragement from Peter on the Last Days&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear Peter was Amillennial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;2Pe 3:3-13 knowing this first of all, that scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing, following their own sinful desires. [4] They will say, &amp;ldquo;Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation.&amp;rdquo; [5] For they deliberately overlook this fact, that the heavens existed long ago, and the earth was formed out of water and through water by the word of God, [6] and that by means of these, the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished. [7] But by the same word, the heavens and earth that now exist are stored up for fire, being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly. [8] But do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord, one day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day. [9] The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish but that all should reach repentance. [10] But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed. [11] Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of people ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness, [12] waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set on fire and dissolved, and the heavenly bodies will melt as they burn! [13] But according to his promise, we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-201&#34;&gt;Rev 20:1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Next, I saw an angel coming down from heaven, who had the key to the Abyss and a great chain in his hand.&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 9:1-3 And the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star fallen from heaven to earth, and he was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit. [2] He opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and from the shaft rose smoke like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the shaft. [3] Then from the smoke came locusts on the earth, and they were given power like the power of scorpions of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luk 8:30-32 Jesus then asked him, &amp;ldquo;What is your name?&amp;rdquo; And he said, &amp;ldquo;Legion,&amp;rdquo; for many demons had entered him. [31] And they begged him not to command them to depart into the abyss. [32] Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and they begged him to let them enter these. So he permitted them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jude 1:6 And the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In chapter 9, demonic locusts were released. Here Satan is going to be bound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-202-3&#34;&gt;Rev 20:2-3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan [the Adversary], and chained him up for a thousand years. He threw him into the Abyss, locked it, and sealed it over him; so that he could not deceive the nations anymore until the thousand years were over. After that, he has to be set free for a little while.&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 24:21-22 On that day, the LORD will punish the host of heaven, in heaven, and the kings of the earth, on the earth. [22] They will be gathered together as prisoners in a pit; they will be shut up in a prison, and after many days they will be punished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the dragon/serpent from Chapter 12.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Peter 5:8 Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary, the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antichrist and false prophet were dealt with in chapter 19; now Messiah deals with Satan himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish texts speak of fallen angels being bound until the day of their judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck Missler, a premillennialist, liked to quip, &amp;ldquo;if we&amp;rsquo;re presently in the Millennium (as Amillennialists and postmillennialists say we are), then Satan&amp;rsquo;s chain is way too long.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, the different views, which hold that things are getting better and better, are difficult to reconcile with the reality of evil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verses 8-9, Satan escapes protective custody and has free reign once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;rsquo;t told much more than that and are not told why this happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-204&#34;&gt;Rev 20:4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Then I saw thrones, and those seated on them received authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for testifying about Yeshua and proclaiming the Word of God, also those who had not worshipped the beast or its image and had not received the mark on their foreheads and on their hands. They came to life and ruled with the Messiah for a thousand years.&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 19:28 Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Cor 6:2 Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you incompetent to try trivial cases?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 8:17 and if children, then heirs&amp;mdash;heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan 7:22 until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High, and the time came when the saints possessed the kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that John sees only Tribulation-era believers does not necessarily preclude all believers or even those martyred by some other form besides beheading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Roman Empire, beheading was the method of execution for &lt;em&gt;Roman Citizens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-citizens suffered a much more painful ending, including death by crucifixion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McGee sees the Raptured believers in heaven, while the tribulation believers, along with the Old Testament saints reigning on earth from Jerusalem, with Jesus &amp;ldquo;commuting&amp;rdquo; back and forth. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;d go that far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler sees four classes: the OT saints, the raptured church, the Tribulation Martyrs, and the Tribulation saints. The final group is those who did not die during the tribulation and did not worship the beast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However it works out, I&amp;rsquo;m sure we&amp;rsquo;ll be happy with our position as long as we are found written in the book of life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-205&#34;&gt;Rev 20:5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;(The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were over.) This is the first resurrection.&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stern inserts &amp;ldquo;the rest of the dead&amp;rdquo; as a parenthetical phrase to refer to the wicked who are not part of the first resurrection. Keener also interprets the passage this way. Otherwise, we are left with a third group of believers who miss out on the Millennium, contradicting verse 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-206&#34;&gt;Rev 20:6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Blessed and holy is anyone who has a part in the first resurrection; over him, the second death has no power. On the contrary, they will be cohanim of God and of the Messiah, and they will rule with him for the thousand years.&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In putting it all together, everyone involved with the first resurrection reigns with Him for 1000 years; therefore, the &amp;ldquo;rest of the dead&amp;rdquo; who are not raised until after the 1000 years (in verse 5) can&amp;rsquo;t be part of the first resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 1:6 and made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in chapter one, we examined the seven beatitudes in Revelation. This one is number six. The last one is in Rev 22:7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-207-8&#34;&gt;Rev 20:7-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;When the thousand years are over, the Adversary will be set free from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for the battle. Their number is countless as the sand on the seashore;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eze 7:2 &amp;ldquo;And you, O son of man, thus says the Lord GOD to the land of Israel: An end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eze 38:2-3 &amp;ldquo;Son of man, set your face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him [3] and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;rsquo;t told why Satan is released. From our perspective, his list of charges should be adequate to secure a conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps like in Job 1, Satan argues, &amp;ldquo;of course, people follow you in the Millennium because you don&amp;rsquo;t give them a choice not to.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To phrase the above slightly differently, those who are alive (not resurrected) during the Millennium do not have the opportunity to accrue merit when Satan is bound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it appears that all flesh would be wiped out in the tribulation, some commentators contend there will be folks living at that time who will make it into the Millennium. These are the people who end up being deceived in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish sages write of mass conversions of Pagans in the messianic time to be followed by mass apostasy in the time of Gog and Magog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gog is the final enemy of Israel in Ezekiel 38-39. Much of the battle appears to align with the gathering of the nations against God in Revelation 16 and 19 more than it does in Revelation 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many see Gog and Magog as symbolic of all nations who assemble for war against the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gematria value is 70, which is the number of the nations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 2:1 Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-209&#34;&gt;Rev 20:9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;and they came up over the breadth of the Land and surrounded the camp of God&amp;rsquo;s people and the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and consumed them.&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 87:2 the LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwelling places of Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eze 39:6 I will send fire on Magog and on those who dwell securely in the coastlands, and they shall know that I am the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 30:33 For a burning place has long been prepared; indeed, for the king, it is made ready, its pyre made deep and wide, with fire and wood in abundance; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of sulfur, kindles it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-2010&#34;&gt;Rev 20:10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;The Adversary who had deceived them was hurled into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satan is ultimately judged and defeated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-2011-the-great-white-throne-judgment&#34;&gt;Rev 20:11 The Great White Throne Judgment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Next, I saw a great white throne and the One sitting on it. Earth and heaven fled from his presence, and no place was found for them.&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is judgment day just before the New Heaven and New Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 14:10 Why do you pass judgment on your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Cor 5:10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 2:16 on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-2012&#34;&gt;Rev 20:12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;And I saw the dead, both great and small, standing in front of the throne. Books were opened, and another book was opened, the Book of Life, and the dead were judged from what was written in the books, according to what they had done.&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mal 3:18 Then once more you shall see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Books were opened implies this will be a very public ceremony; the wicked will have nowhere to hide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exo 32:31-33 So Moses returned to the LORD and said, &amp;ldquo;Alas, these people have sinned a great sin. They have made for themselves gods of gold. [32] But now, if you will forgive their sin&amp;mdash;but if not, please blot me out of your book that you have written.&amp;rdquo; [33] But the LORD said to Moses, &amp;ldquo;Whoever has sinned against me, I will blot out of my book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan 12:2 And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joh 5:27-29 And he has given him authority to execute judgment because he is the Son of Man. [28] Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice [29] and come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eze 18:20-23 The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself. [21] &amp;ldquo;But if a wicked person turns away from all his sins that he has committed and keeps all my statutes and does what is just and right, he shall surely live; he shall not die. [22] None of the transgressions that he has committed shall be remembered against him; for the righteousness that he has done, he shall live. [23] Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked, declares the Lord GOD, and not rather that he should turn from his way and live?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 69:27-29 Add to them punishment upon punishment; may they have no acquittal from you. [28] Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; let them not be enrolled among the righteous. [29] But I am afflicted and in pain; let your salvation, O God, set me on high!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish thought holds that all will be judged according to their works (Psa 62:12; Pro 24:12; Jer 17:10; Jer 32:19; Eze 18:30), but former sinful works are canceled by true repentance would not count against the righteous (Eze 18:21-22).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-2013&#34;&gt;Rev 20:13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;The sea gave up the dead in it; and Death and Sh&amp;rsquo;ol gave up the dead in them, and they were judged, each according to what he had done.&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mt 25:46 And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the sheep and goat judgment in Matthew 25:31-46.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hos 13:14 I shall ransom them from the power of Sheol; I shall redeem them from Death. O Death, where are your plagues? O Sheol, where is your sting? Compassion is hidden from my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended&amp;rdquo; clause in verse 5 appears to go here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-2014-15&#34;&gt;Rev 20:14-15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Then Death and Sh&amp;rsquo;ol were hurled into the lake of fire. This is the second death&amp;mdash;the lake of fire. Anyone whose name was not found written in the Book of Life was hurled into the lake of fire.&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 25:8 He will swallow up death forever, and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from all faces, and the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for the LORD has spoken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 21:8 But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 2:11 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who conquers will not be hurt by the second death.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Born once, die twice; born twice, die once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death and Sheol have served their purposes; now, they are no longer needed. Sin is now banished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rev 21:1, we&amp;rsquo;ll see that the sea also disappears. The sea in the Bible is a symbol of death, destruction, fear, and tribulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some maintain that the Lake of Fire symbolizes a world without and eternally separated from God. Either way, it&amp;rsquo;s not a good place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text makes it clear that it is not God who has determined their fate but the people themselves by their deeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those deeds specifically include a failure to trust in the salvation of Yeshua, the messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A contradiction from our perspective&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The righteous can only become so by a miracle of God. We were dead in our sins. A dead person cannot resurrect or save himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unrighteous has only himself to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark 9:43-48 And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than with two hands to go to hell, to the unquenchable fire. 45 And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell. 47 And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell, 48 &amp;lsquo;where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two deaths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical death: separation of the body from the soul&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiritual death: separation of the soul from God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time, we&amp;rsquo;ll get a peek into eternity with the new heaven and new earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;revelation-21----the-age-to-come&#34;&gt;Revelation 21 &amp;ndash; the Age to Come&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the old heaven and the old earth had passed away, and the sea was no longer there. Also, I saw the holy city, New Yerushalayim, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared like a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. I heard a loud voice from the throne say, &amp;ldquo;See! God&amp;rsquo;s Sh&amp;rsquo;khinah is with mankind, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and he himself, God-with-them, will be their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. There will no longer be any death, and there will no longer be any mourning, crying, or pain; because the old order has passed away.&amp;rdquo; Then the One sitting on the throne said, &amp;ldquo;Look! I am making everything new!&amp;rdquo; Also, he said, &amp;ldquo;Write, &amp;lsquo;These words are true and trustworthy!&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;It is done! I am the &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;Z,&amp;rsquo; the Beginning and the End. To anyone thirsty, I will give water free of charge from the Fountain of Life. He who wins the victory will receive these things, and I will be his God, and he will be my son. But as for the cowardly, the untrustworthy, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those involved with the occult and with drugs, idol-worshippers, and all liars&amp;mdash;their destiny is the lake burning with fire and sulfur, the second death.&amp;rdquo; One of the seven angels having the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues approached me and said, &amp;ldquo;Come! I will show you the Bride, the Wife of the Lamb.&amp;rdquo; He carried me off in the Spirit to the top of a great, high mountain and showed me the holy city, Yerushalayim, coming down out of heaven from God. It had the Sh&amp;rsquo;khinah of God so that its brilliance was like that of a priceless jewel, like a crystal-clear diamond. It had a great, high wall with twelve gates; at the gates were twelve angels and inscribed on the gates were the names of the twelve tribes of Isra&amp;rsquo;el. There were three gates to the east, three gates to the north, three gates to the south, and three gates to the west. The wall of the city was built on twelve foundation stones, and on these were the twelve names of the twelve emissaries of the Lamb. The angel speaking with me had a gold measuring rod with which to measure the city, its gates, and its wall. The city is laid out in a square, its length equal to its width. With his rod, he measured the city at 1,500 miles, with length, width, and height the same. He measured its wall at 216 feet by human standards of measurement, which the angel was using. The wall was made of diamond, and the city was of pure gold resembling pure glass. The foundations of the city wall were decorated with all kinds of precious stones&amp;mdash;the first foundation stone was diamond, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh turquoise, and the twelfth amethyst. The twelve gates were twelve pearls, with each gate made of a single pearl. The city&amp;rsquo;s main street was pure gold, transparent as glass. I saw no Temple in the city, for Adonai, God of heaven&amp;rsquo;s armies, is its Temple, as is the Lamb. The city has no need for the sun or the moon to shine on it because God&amp;rsquo;s Sh&amp;rsquo;khinah gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb. The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it. Its gates will never close; they stay open all day because night will not exist there, and the honor and splendor of the nations will be brought into it. Nothing impure may enter it, nor anyone who does shameful things or lies; the only ones who may enter are those whose names are written in the Lamb&amp;rsquo;s Book of Life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Old Testament and the Gospels, the messianic age (millennium, Kingdom of/from Heaven) and the age to come (new heaven/earth, eternity) are often blurred.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Jewish Sages have consistently interpreted Isaiah 64:4 as referring to the age to come.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isa 64:4&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;From of old no one has heard or perceived by the ear, no eye has seen a God besides you, who acts for those who wait for him&amp;rdquo; (Isa 64:4).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the age to come like?  We can&amp;rsquo;t tell you! No eye has seen it! It&amp;rsquo;s indescribable!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That distinction is more noticeable in the apostolic writings, where it becomes clear that they are two distinct eras.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Cor 2:9-10 But, as it is written, &amp;ldquo;What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man imagined, what God has prepared for those who love him&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash; [10] these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul is saying what formerly was hidden is now partially revealed through the spirit.
*The distinction is most noticeable in Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Chapters 19 and 20 we learned about the thousand-year reign of King Messiah. Then there was a great resurrection and judgment of the wicked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here in Chapter 21, we are looking at the world to come.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The world to come (olam habah in Hebrew) is not quite the same as our concept of heaven if our concept of heaven is that we are bodiless souls floating around in bliss.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation teaches us that by this time in the world to come, we have physical bodies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the same time, the world to come will not share the same physical characteristics of our planet today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is some type of physical spirituality that is beyond our capacity to comprehend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It might be helpful to think of it as not an entirely new earth but as a recycled, repurposed, or even restored earth,  redesigned the way God originally intended it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-211-john-sees-a-new-heaven-and-a-new-earth&#34;&gt;Rev 21:1 John sees a New Heaven and a New Earth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 65:17-19 &amp;ldquo;For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth, and the former things shall not be remembered or come into mind. [18] But be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for behold, I create Jerusalem to be a joy, and her people to be a gladness. [19] I will rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in my people; no more shall be heard in it the sound of weeping and the cry of distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With death gone, conditions are set for the restoration of Eden as God intended. If it were up to us, we would mess it up again. This time, we have a Messiah to shepherd us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah also reminds us that a restored Eden could not be possible without the judgment of chapter 20 and the preceding chapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isa 66:22-24 &amp;ldquo;For as the new heavens and the new earth that I make shall remain before me, says the LORD, so shall your offspring and your name remain. [23] From new moon to new moon, and from Sabbath to Sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, declares the LORD. [24] &amp;ldquo;And they shall go out and look on the dead bodies of the men who have rebelled against me. For their worm shall not die, their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the &amp;ldquo;creation being set free.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rom 8:19-21 For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. [20] For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope [21] that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster sees the sea as symbolic of chaos, and the chaos is now gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern sees the &amp;ldquo;sea&amp;rdquo; as referring to Israel&amp;rsquo;s western border of the Mediterranean Sea no longer there. The entire earth is now Messiah&amp;rsquo;s Kingdom. In his view, there will still be oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster also noted that in the ancient Canaanite religion, the god Mot lived in the desert/wilderness and is the Hebrew word for death. The god Yam lived in the sea and is the Hebrew word for sea. Here we are told Yam is no more and in verse four we will be told Mot is no more. This type of symbolism is throughout the prophets and the Psalms, so possibly John picked up on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler notes that the sea provides antiseptic salinity that purges, cleanses, and preserves our planet. There is no need for such cleansing action any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-212-the-new-jerusalem&#34;&gt;Rev 21:2 The New Jerusalem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capital city of the age to come is heavenly Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 11:16&lt;/strong&gt; But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrew has a dual form in addition to singular and plural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yerushalayim - יְרוּשָׁלַיִם - is in the dual form,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a subtle hint that there are and were always two Jerusalems, one earthly and one heavenly or sometimes called the one above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gal 4:26&lt;/strong&gt; But the Jerusalem &lt;em&gt;above&lt;/em&gt; is free, and she is our mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have talked about how the church, the bride of Christ, is to remain pure and undefiled for her marriage to the Son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, the city of Jerusalem is depicted as a bride, pure and beautifully dressed for her Husband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isa 62:5-7&lt;/strong&gt; For as a young man marries a young woman, so shall your sons marry you, and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you. [6] On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have set watchmen; all the day and all the night they shall never be silent. You who put the LORD in remembrance, take no rest, [7] and give him no rest until he establishes Jerusalem and makes it a praise in the earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mystically, Jerusalem and God&amp;rsquo;s people are the same, as we shall see when we get to verse 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerusalem is contrasted with Babylon, the great whore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-213-the-word-tabernacled-among-us&#34;&gt;Rev 21:3 the Word tabernacled among us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, &amp;ldquo;Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the final fulfillment of God&amp;rsquo;s promise to Abraham and Moses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 17:7&lt;/strong&gt; And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ex 6:7&lt;/strong&gt; I will take you to be my people, and I will be your God, and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who has brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word Shekinah means &amp;ldquo;dwelling&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;tabernacle.&amp;rdquo;  Another name for the wilderness tabernacle was &amp;ldquo;the Tent of Meeting.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lev 26:11-12&lt;/strong&gt; I will make my dwelling among you, and my soul shall not abhor you. [12] And I will walk among you and will be your God, and you shall be my people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zec 2:10&lt;/strong&gt; Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for behold, I come, and I will dwell in your midst, declares the LORD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Chronicles 6:18&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;But will God indeed dwell with man on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you, how much less this house that I have built!&amp;rdquo; (the answer is &amp;ldquo;Yes!&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John 1:14&lt;/strong&gt; And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the Messiah&amp;rsquo;s names is &amp;ldquo;Immanuel,&amp;rdquo; God with us. Isaiah 7:14 has a double-fulfillment: once at Jesus&amp;rsquo; first coming and once here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isa 7:14&lt;/strong&gt; Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-214-former-things-passed-away&#34;&gt;Rev 21:4 Former things passed away&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tears, death, mourning, crying, and pain are the &amp;ldquo;former things&amp;rdquo; Isaiah spoke about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isa 25:8&lt;/strong&gt; He will swallow up death forever, and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from all faces, and the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for the LORD has spoken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isa 65:17&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth, and the &lt;strong&gt;former things&lt;/strong&gt; shall not be remembered or come into mind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The age to come is a correction of man&amp;rsquo;s mortal condition caused by sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-215-6-all-things-new&#34;&gt;Rev 21:5-6 All things new&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And he who was seated on the throne said, &amp;ldquo;Behold, I am making all things new.&amp;rdquo; Also he said, &amp;ldquo;Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.&amp;rdquo; And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IT IS DONE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the seventh angel who said &amp;ldquo;it is done&amp;rdquo; (Rev 16:17), this is not the same Greek word for &amp;ldquo;it is finished&amp;rdquo; that Jesus used on the cross, but it is the same word He used in Matthew 5:18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mat 5:17-18 &amp;ldquo;Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. [18] For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is &lt;strong&gt;accomplished&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without sin, there is no need for a behavior code. Heaven and earth have passed away and the Torah is fulfilled, completed, and accomplished&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To say that the Torah is &amp;ldquo;finished&amp;rdquo; probably isn&amp;rsquo;t the best English translation; we will be LIVING OUT TORAH every day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jer 31:33&lt;/strong&gt; For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: I will put my Torah within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has accomplished Torah within us&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living water without payment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a reference to Isaiah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isa 55:1-2&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;Come, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; and he who has no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. [2] Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread, and your labor for that which does not satisfy? Listen diligently to me, and eat what is good, and delight yourselves in rich food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirst represents spiritual need; living water is spiritual satisfaction in the form of the Holy Spirit. There is only one source of living water, and that&amp;rsquo;s Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rev 7:17&lt;/strong&gt; For the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd, and he will guide them to springs of living water, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joh 7:37-39&lt;/strong&gt; On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, &amp;ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. [38] Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, &amp;lsquo;Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; [39] Now, this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive, for as yet the Spirit had not been given because Jesus was not yet glorified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation (and indeed the entire Bible) is very clear that there are only two choices for each of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drink the cup of blessing or the cup of wrath&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dine at the Lamb&amp;rsquo;s marriage supper or be a feast for the birds of the air&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose life or choose death (Deu 30:19 I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Therefore choose life, that you and your offspring may live)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro 14:27&lt;/strong&gt; The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life that one may turn away from the snares of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Straddling the fence is not an option we have, though many live their lives only partially committed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-217-promise-to-the-overcomer&#34;&gt;Rev 21:7 Promise to the overcomer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The one who conquers will have this heritage, and I will be his God and he will be my son.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This heritage: the Jewish sages talk about being &amp;ldquo;granted a portion in the world to come.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We attain this portion by overcoming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Jn 5:4&lt;/strong&gt; For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world&amp;mdash;our faith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 12:11 tells us how to be an overcomer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rev 12:11&lt;/strong&gt; And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would read this as we don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have to be martyred but we have to be prepared to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a certain sense, we should live our lives not caring that we may be martyred one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the word for &amp;ldquo;martyr&amp;rdquo; is the same as &amp;ldquo;witness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-218-promise-to-the-non-overcomers&#34;&gt;Rev 21:8 Promise to the non-overcomers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This group has not overcome, but hasbeen overtaken by this world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This class of people has no portion in the world to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to staunch unbelievers, these could also be the non-overcomers who were in the church. As soon as tough times hit, they abandoned the faith. They chose the other path rather than suffer for and with Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some translations say &amp;ldquo;fearful&amp;rdquo; whereas the ESV says &amp;ldquo;cowardly. Fear is not from God (except for Fear of the LORD). Do you worry a lot? I do and that&amp;rsquo;s not good. (I&amp;rsquo;m not saying that worrying will send you into the lake of fire; but it&amp;rsquo;s not God&amp;rsquo;s will for us to worry).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last lesson we looked at a passage from Ezekiel which says if one repents of former sin, that person is welcomed as righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 9:21, nor did they &lt;strong&gt;repent&lt;/strong&gt; of their murders or their sorceries or their sexual immorality or their thefts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is repenting and not remaining in these sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-219-11-jerusalem-is-the-bride-of-christ&#34;&gt;Rev 21:9-11 Jerusalem is the Bride of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues and spoke to me, saying, &amp;ldquo;Come, I will show you the Bride, the wife of the Lamb.&amp;rdquo; And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great, high mountain, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God, having the glory of God, its radiance like a most rare jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We typically think of the Bride as the Church; but here it is Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a deeper meaning?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jerusalem was established by God to be a city set apart; it even has shalom (peace) as part of it&amp;rsquo;s name,  yet today it is anything but set apart and anything but peaceful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The church was established by God to be a people set apart and holy to Him.  We are to be vessels for the Light of the World while not being ensnared in the world&amp;rsquo;s systems of idolatry and adultery.  How well are we doing on those things?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imagery of being shown a great city is from Ezekiel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eze 40:2&lt;/strong&gt; In visions of God he brought me to the land of Israel, and set me down on a very high mountain, on which was a structure like a city to the south.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-2112-13-twelve-gatestribes&#34;&gt;Rev 21:12-13 Twelve gates/tribes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It had a great, high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel were inscribed&amp;mdash;on the east three gates, on the north three gates, on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recalls the camp in the wilderness as well as Ezekiel&amp;rsquo;s vision&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Num 2:2&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;The people of Israel shall camp each by his own standard, with the banners of their fathers&amp;rsquo; houses. They shall camp facing the tent of meeting on every side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eze 48:30-34&lt;/strong&gt; On the north side, three gates, the gate of Reuben, the gate of Judah, and the gate of Levi, the gates of the city being named after the tribes of Israel. On the east side, which is to be 4,500 cubits, three gates (etc. for the remaining tribes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a conjecture by an early church father that relates to the camp of Israel. We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss this more at the end of the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-2114-twelve-foundationsapostles&#34;&gt;Rev 21:14 Twelve foundations/apostles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access to the city is through Israel. Paul stated this a number of times, yet most of the gentile church sees itself divorced from Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 12 tribes are the walls, the 12 apostles are the foundation and Jesus is the chief cornerstone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eph 2:19-20&lt;/strong&gt; So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, [20] built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Strangers and aliens&amp;rdquo; are terms for gentiles who attached themselves to the Israelites but had to remain outside the camp. We are no longer outside Israel but &amp;ldquo;grafted in.&amp;rdquo; See Romans 9-11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take note of the word &amp;ldquo;foundation.&amp;rdquo; We&amp;rsquo;re going to come back to this at the end of the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-2115-taking-measurements&#34;&gt;Rev 21:15 Taking measurements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15 And the one who spoke with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city and its gates and walls.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In chapter 11, John was told to measure the tribulation temple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rev 11:1-2&lt;/strong&gt; Then I was given a measuring rod like a staff, and I was told, &amp;ldquo;Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship there, [2] but do not measure the court outside the temple; leave that out, for it is given over to the nations, and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is like Ezekiel&amp;rsquo;s vision&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eze 40:3&lt;/strong&gt; When he brought me there, behold, there was a man whose appearance was like bronze, with a linen cord and a measuring reed in his hand. And he was standing in the gateway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here John is measuring the city, not the temple; in fact, there is no Temple building because God dwells in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-2116-17-12000-stadia-144-cubits&#34;&gt;Rev 21:16-17 12,000 stadia 144 cubits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16 The city lies foursquare, its length the same as its width. And he measured the city with his rod, 12,000 stadia. Its length and width and height are equal. He also measured its wall, 144 cubits by human measurement, which is also an angel&amp;rsquo;s measurement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t really know what a stadia is in &amp;ldquo;age to come&amp;rdquo; terms but in earthly terms, this is about 1500 miles on a side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the same way, we don&amp;rsquo;t know what an &amp;ldquo;angel&amp;rsquo;s cubit&amp;rdquo; is. 144 human cubits is approximately 216 feet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that there is a &amp;ldquo;height&amp;rdquo; measurement in addition to a wall height measurement - don&amp;rsquo;t assume this heavenly city is limited to three earthly dimensions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The many &amp;ldquo;12&amp;quot;s in this section are probably more significant than the actual measurements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using only the length and width, the surface area is 12,000 * 12,000 or 144,000,000 square stadia.  The volume would be 12,000 cubed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-2118-20-wall-of-precious-stones&#34;&gt;Rev 21:18-20 Wall of precious stones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18 The wall was built of jasper, while the city was pure gold, like clear glass. The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every kind of jewel. The first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fulfills the prophecy by Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isa 54:12&lt;/strong&gt; I will make your pinnacles of agate, your gates of carbuncles, and &lt;strong&gt;all your wall of precious stones.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The High Priest&amp;rsquo;s chest plate (called an Ephod) had 12 stones representing the 12 tribes of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The High Priest was to bear the tribes on his heart before the LORD continuously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exo 28:17-20&lt;/strong&gt; You shall set in it four rows of stones. A row of sardius, topaz, and carbuncle shall be the first row; [18] and the second row an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond; [19] and the third row a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; [20] and the fourth row a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. They shall be set in gold filigree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will see at the beginning of Chapter 22 that the New Jerusalem is a restored Eden, and our relationship with God is restored to how He originally designed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezekiel uses similar precious stone imagery to describe Lucifer&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;clothing&amp;rdquo; in Eden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eze 28:13 You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering, sardius, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, emerald, and carbuncle; and crafted in gold were your settings and your engravings. On the day that you were created they were prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-2121-22-pearly-gates-and-streets-of-gold&#34;&gt;Rev 21:21-22 Pearly gates and streets of gold&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates made of a single pearl, and the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the famous pearly gates, but I don&amp;rsquo;t see Peter anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pearls are an interesting item in the Bible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An oyster is an unclean sea creature because it has neither fins nor scales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While observant Jews will shun shellfish, people don&amp;rsquo;t typically eat pearls.  Therefore Jews don&amp;rsquo;t generally have any issues with them and treat them as a precious gem along with their geological counterparts.  I&amp;rsquo;ve heard it taught by Christians that pearls themselves are unclean - this simply isn&amp;rsquo;t true.  As a side note, along these lines, the blue dye required for the Tzitzit in Numbers 15:38 comes from a snail (unclean to eat but no problem in handling the dye).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pearls generally represent wisdom and knowledge in the Bible, but are often used in what we might call a &amp;ldquo;backhanded&amp;rdquo; way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proverbs 8:11 and Job 28:18 Wisdom is better than pearls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proverbs 20:16 There are gold and pearls; but the dearest jewels are lips that speak knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mt 7:6 Do not give to dogs what is holy, and do not throw your pearls before swine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation 17:4, the whore of Babylon was adorned in pearls (and 1 Ti 2:9 Paul says respectable women should not be adorned with pearls!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev 18:12, and 18:16 the merchants of Babylon mourned the loss of pearls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temple would be redundant in the age to come because God is present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-2123-25-i-am-the-light-of-the-world&#34;&gt;Rev 21:23-25 &amp;ldquo;I am the light of the World&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb. By its light will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it, and its gates will never be shut by day&amp;mdash;and there will be no night there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-explanatory as to why there is no need of the sun or the moon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fulfillment of Isaiah 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isa 60:19-20&lt;/strong&gt; The sun shall be no more your light by day, nor for brightness shall the moon give you light; but the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory. [20] Your sun shall no more go down, nor your moon withdraw itself; for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your days of mourning shall be ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Genesis, light was created first. The sun and moon were not created until the fourth day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 1:3-4&lt;/strong&gt; And God said, &amp;ldquo;Let there be light,&amp;rdquo; and there was light. And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let there be light&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; were also the first words spoken by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-2126-the-nations-will-be-there&#34;&gt;Rev 21:26 The nations will be there&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the very beginning, nations who glorify God are rewarded; those who do not are cursed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 12:1-3&lt;/strong&gt; Now the LORD said to Abram, &amp;ldquo;Go from your country and your kindred and your father&amp;rsquo;s house to the land that I will show you. [2] And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. [3] I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nations, often portrayed negatively in Scripture, are now purified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be no unregenerate goyim in the New Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also appears that gentiles will not lose their national identity (at least not entirely).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-2127-nothing-unclean-will-be-present&#34;&gt;Rev 21:27 Nothing unclean will be present&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those who are written in the Lamb&amp;rsquo;s book of life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not saying that there are unclean people present who can&amp;rsquo;t enter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is saying that there will not be any unclean present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment has passed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gates never close; there is no one on the New Earth who is not welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-221-3----restored-eden&#34;&gt;Rev 22:1-3 &amp;ndash; Restored Eden&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb [2] through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. [3] No longer will there be anything accursed, but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is describing what appears to be a restored Garden of Eden, in the middle of which is the throne of God and of the Lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll unpack this more next lesson, but we needed to reference the passage prior to discussing the ancient conjecture below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the river flows out from the Throne and through the middle of the city. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t encompass the entire New Jerusalem but is only a portion of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;irenaeus-conjecture----three-levels-of-the-new-jerusalem&#34;&gt;Irenaeus Conjecture &amp;ndash; three levels of the New Jerusalem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is adapted from an article, &amp;ldquo;What No Eye Has Seen: Heaven, Paradise, and the City in Irenaeus&amp;rsquo; Against Heresies 5:36&amp;rdquo; by D. Thomas Lancaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his extensive work, &lt;em&gt;Against Heresies,&lt;/em&gt; the early church father Irenaeus (130-202) claimed to be passing on teaching about the New Jerusalem from &amp;ldquo;the Elders, the disciples of the apostles,&amp;rdquo; in other words the Elders were men in direct contact with the apostles. 2000 years after the fact, we have no way of proving or disproving these assertions, but we have no reason to believe Irenaeus was not being genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the comparison to the camp of Israel in Numbers 2-5, as well as referencing some of Jesus&amp;rsquo; teachings, Irenaeus taught that believers will be assigned to one of three levels in the New Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at the image below, you&amp;rsquo;ll see there are three separate areas. 1) The Tabernacle (Camp of God), 2) The Levites (Camp of the Levites), 3) The 12 Tribes (Camp of Israel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irenaeus then noted three distinct areas of the New Jerusalem: 1) the Throne/Temple (not a building but the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb- Rev 21:22), 2) the restored Garden of Eden (Rev 22:1-3), and the city extending to the four walls, with the gates of three tribes within each wall (Rev 21:12-21).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irenaeus then connected passages in Matthew 13:23, Luke 14, and 1 Corinthians 3:10-15&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mt 13:23&lt;/strong&gt; As for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it. He indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luke 14:7-11&lt;/strong&gt; Now he told a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the places of honor, saying to them, [8] &amp;ldquo;When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in a place of honor, lest someone more distinguished than you be invited by him, [9] and he who invited you both will come and say to you, &amp;lsquo;Give your place to this person,&amp;rsquo; and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place. [10] But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when your host comes he may say to you, &amp;lsquo;Friend, move up higher.&amp;rsquo; Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you. [11] For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Co 3:10-15&lt;/strong&gt; According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation, and someone else is building upon it. Let each one take care how he builds upon it. [11] For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. [12] Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw&amp;mdash; [13] each one&amp;rsquo;s work will become manifest, for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done. [14] If the work that anyone has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward. [15] If anyone&amp;rsquo;s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only through fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Jesus did not explain the significance of the 100/60/30, the teaching of the Apostles was apparently that there will be three different levels of reward&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all a believer had was wood, hay, and stubble, maybe representing only a 30-fold or less increase of the gifts God gave to him, that person would get the third, outermost level correlating to the Camp of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is within the city walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, he is still in a dwelling place in the Presence of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is still saved but only through fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second believer might be in the 60-fold increase category. This person would be in the second circle, the restored Eden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this person had a little bit of gold and silver left over after his wood, hay, and stubble burned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He fared better than most, but perhaps he wasted too much time watching TV or surfing the internet when he could have focused his efforts on using God&amp;rsquo;s gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;rsquo;s the person who was All-in for Jesus during his time on earth. This person, according to this teaching, receives the highest level in the temple/throne district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This person is still a sinner and made some mistakes, but overall he or she used their gifts to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe instead of watching sports, they helped with the food pantry or the church nursery every week and never complained;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe instead of taking family vacations to Disneyworld, they took their family on mission trips to help others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they quietly gave 20% of their income away anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They did these things without expecting any reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, they would tell you that they enjoyed serving others and never once considered what they did a sacrifice or a trade-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people received a 100-fold return and will be rewarded with a dwelling place in the town closest to the Throne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Irenaeus quoted the Elders as saying, &amp;ldquo;Then those who are deemed worthy of an abode in the (center) will go there, others shall enjoy the delights of Paradise/Eden, and others shall possess the splendor of the City; for everywhere the Savior shall be seen to the degree that they who see Him shall be worthy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not at all saying this is precisely how our heavenly rewards will be doled out, but given that it&amp;rsquo;s a second-century tradition, it is worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do know that Scripture is clear that the way we spend our lives today somehow, someway affects our standing in the next life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus had several parables where the King went away and left his servants in charge. He then returned one day unexpectedly and demanded an accounting of how the servants grew the business while the king was away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who were profitable were rewarded;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who squandered or did nothing with the master&amp;rsquo;s gifts were punished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has given us gifts; one day, He will demand to know what we did with those gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did we put them to work, or did we waste them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus&amp;rsquo; instruction to take the lowest seat at the wedding banquet, also reminds us to never assume a place of honor and prestige. In the teaching, the individual took his seat at the lower station and waited to be invited to a higher station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must never assume we have arrived and must never do work to get a reward. Paul expressed it this way in Philippians:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Php 3:12-15&lt;/strong&gt; Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own because Christ Jesus has made me his own. [13] Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, [14] I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. [15] Let those of us who are mature think this way, and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal that also to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a few more miles on your tires like me, you may look back on your Christian life and regret of all the missed opportunities and wasted time spent on non-kingdom tasks. I would remind us of Roman 8:1 that there is no condemnation for those in Christ. Our story is not yet over. With every breath left in us, we can decide to live for God and not ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a younger believer, I encourage you to use the coming days, months, and years for His glory, not yours. The world and the Enemy will do all they can to get you comfortable. Perhaps let this message serve as a wake-up alarm that the righteous deeds that we do for God have eternal value. Jesus told us to store up our treasure in heaven. We do this to serve Him and honor Him with our time and resources while we are on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May each of us live our lives here and now in such a way that on Judgment Day, Jesus says to us, &amp;ldquo;well done good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master&amp;rdquo; (Mt 25:21). Then in that day may we be surprised to hear Jesus say to us, &amp;ldquo;Friend, move up higher&amp;rdquo; (Luke 14:10).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;revelation-22&#34;&gt;Revelation 22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next the angel showed me the river of the water of life, sparkling like crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb. Between the main street and the river was the Tree of Life producing twelve kinds of fruit, a different kind every month; and the leaves of the tree were for healing the nations— no longer will there be any curses. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his servants will worship him; they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. Night will no longer exist, so they will need neither the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun, because Adonai, God, will shine upon them. And they will reign as kings forever and ever. Then he said to me, &amp;ldquo;These words are true and trustworthy: Adonai, God of the spirits of the prophets, sent his angel to show his servants the things that must happen soon.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Look! I am coming very soon. Blessed is the person who obeys the words of the prophecy written in this book!&amp;rdquo; Then I, Yochanan, the one hearing and seeing these things, when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel showing them to me. But he said to me, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t do that! I am only a fellow-servant with you and your brothers, the prophets and the people who obey the words in this book. Worship God!&amp;rdquo; Then he said to me, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t seal up the words of the prophecy in this book, because the time of their fulfillment is near. &amp;ldquo;Whoever keeps acting wickedly, let him go on acting wickedly; whoever is filthy, let him go on being made filthy. &amp;ldquo;Also, whoever is righteous, let him go on doing what is righteous; and whoever is holy, let him go on being made holy.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Pay attention!&amp;rdquo; [says Yeshua,] &amp;ldquo;I am coming soon, and my rewards are with me to give to each person according to what he has done. I am the &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;Z,&amp;rsquo; the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.&amp;rdquo; How blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they have the right to eat from the Tree of Life and go through the gates into the city! Outside are the homosexuals, those involved with the occult and with drugs, the sexually immoral, murderers, idol-worshippers, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood. &amp;ldquo;I, Yeshua, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the Messianic communities. I am the Root and Offspring of David, the bright Morning Star. The Spirit and the Bride say, &amp;lsquo;Come!&amp;rsquo; Let anyone who hears say, &amp;lsquo;Come!&amp;rsquo; And let anyone who is thirsty come—let anyone who wishes, take the water of life free of charge.&amp;rdquo; I warn everyone hearing the words of the prophecy in this book that if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues written in this book. And if anyone takes anything away from the words in the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the Tree of Life and the holy city, as described in this book. &amp;ldquo;The one who is testifying to these things says, &amp;lsquo;Yes, I am coming soon!&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; Amen! Come, Lord Yeshua! May the grace of the Lord Yeshua be with all!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-221&#34;&gt;Rev 22:1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our tour of the New Jerusalem continues from chapter 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This river actually started flowing at the other end of the Bible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gen 2:10 A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a river flowing out of Jerusalem as seen by Ezekiel in the Messianic Temple. Notice the trees on one side and on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eze 47:1-8 Then he brought me back to the door of the temple, and behold, water was issuing from below the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east). The water was flowing down from below the south end of the threshold of the temple, south of the altar. [2] Then he brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around on the outside to the outer gate that faces toward the east; and behold, the water was trickling out on the south side. [3] Going on eastward with a measuring line in his hand, the man measured a thousand cubits, and then led me through the water, and it was ankle-deep. [4] Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water, and it was knee-deep. Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water, and it was waist-deep. [5] Again he measured a thousand, and it was a river that I could not pass through, for the water had risen. It was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be passed through. [6] And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;Son of man, have you seen this?&amp;rdquo; Then he led me back to the bank of the river. [7] As I went back, I saw on the bank of the river very many trees on the one side and on the other. [8] And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah, and enters the (Dead) sea; when the water flows into the sea, the water will become fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe 3:18 &amp;ldquo;And in that day the mountains shall drip sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the streambeds of Judah shall flow with water; and a fountain shall come forth from the house of the LORD and water the Valley of Shittim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zec 14:8 On that day living waters shall flow out from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea and half of them to the western sea. It shall continue in summer as in winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Israel, the rivers don&amp;rsquo;t flow in the summer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 46:4 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy habitation of the Most High.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 36:8 They feast on the abundance of your house, and you give them drink from the river of your delights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The word for &amp;ldquo;your delights&amp;rdquo; is עֲדָנֶ֣יךָ (edanecha) &amp;ldquo;your Eden&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus makes a direct reference to this river flowing out of the Throne in the age to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joh 7:38 Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, &amp;lsquo;Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no other Hebrew scripture verses that say anything a river of living water besides the ones above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-222&#34;&gt;Rev 22:2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a clear reference back to the same Ezekiel 47 passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eze 47:12 And on the banks, on both sides of the river, there will grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither, nor their fruit fail, but they will bear fresh fruit every month, because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation is alluding to Ezekiel 47. As it turns out, Ezekiel is alluding to Psalm 1, which has the exact same symbolism of a tree by a stream, plentiful fruit, and a strong leaf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 1:1-3 Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; [2] but his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night. [3] He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This river flowing out from the throne in the New Jerusalem represents the righteous among us who delight in the Torah of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last lesson we quoted Jeremiah 31:33 and the New Covenant. The hallmark of a new covenant believer is that &amp;ldquo;I will put my Torah within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God and they shall be my people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we see there is a connection between the Etz Chaim that gives eternal life and the Word of God.  Therefore it should come as no surprise when Peter says to jesus “You have the words of eternal life.” in John 6:68.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/torah.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    -  interestingly, the word etz can also mean wood (since wood comes from a tree).  The wooden handle on each end of a Torah scroll is called an Etz Chaim, signifying the connection of the Torah with the Tree of Life.  Even if the handle is silver, it is still called an Etz Chaim.  The word of God is the etz Chaim that gives eternal life.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you still think the Torah has no meaning or relevance for us as Christians? I hope not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humanity is stored back to the original relationship between God and Man in Genesis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen 2:9 And out of the ground the LORD God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, our position will be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tree of Life represents the resurrection. It symbolizes the attainment of immortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam and Eve were not permitted to partake of the Tree of Life, because they were not (yet) resurrected. (Gen 3:22-24. This is the reason they were banished from the Garden of Eden and God had to put a cherubim with a flaming sword to guard the way, let they eat and become immortal in their fallen state.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be permitted! In fact, Jesus promises it to the Church in Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 2:7 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now all clear to eat from the tree of life and will get a different fruit each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, we won&amp;rsquo;t entirely be outside of time boundaries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will still be a mechanism for marking time and seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healing here might be in the sense of &amp;ldquo;making whole.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-223-4&#34;&gt;Rev 22:3-4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No longer will there be anything accursed, but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him. They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The curse from Genesis 3 is lifted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fulfillment of Zec 14:11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And it shall be inhabited, for there shall never again be a decree of utter destruction. Jerusalem shall dwell in security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of a Temple, God and the Lamb will have a throne directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we worship we&amp;rsquo;re going to be fully dialed in and completely satisfied (hopefully without people on a stage jumping around like cheerleaders, light shows, or smoke machines).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See His face&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our world, God is concealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exo 33:20 But,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;you cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1Co 13:12-13 For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known. [13] So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the messianic Era, everyone will know the Lord that He is real, but He won&amp;rsquo;t be fully visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the World to Come everyone will stand in His presence. We will know Him face to face in unhindered and unimpeded fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreheads &amp;ndash; we&amp;rsquo;ve worked with this earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beast branded his name and number on his followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God marks His followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this likely refers to God&amp;rsquo;s word being at the forefront in our hearts and minds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deu 6:8 You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-225&#34;&gt;Rev 22:5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And night will be no more. They will need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discussed this in the last lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original light, before the sun, moon, and the stars, will illuminate once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 60:19 The sun shall be no more your light by day, nor for brightness shall the moon give you light; but the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literal and spiritual darkness is lifted. Messiah is the source of our literal and spiritual illumination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-226----the-conclusion&#34;&gt;Rev 22:6 &amp;ndash; The conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;These words are trustworthy and true. And the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his servants what must soon take place.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John appears to be back on Patmos at this point, still in the presence of his angelic tour guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the parallels between this last section and Chapter 1 over the next couple of verses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 1:1-2 The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his servants the things that must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John, [2] who bore witness to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a literary style called inclusio. Repeating or restating something said at the beginning of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew does this as well with the meaning of the word Immanuel at 1:23 and 28:20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 1:23 “Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel” (which means, &lt;strong&gt;God with us&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 28:20 teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, &lt;strong&gt;I am with you&lt;/strong&gt; always, to the end of the age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-227&#34;&gt;Rev 22:7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;And behold, I am coming soon. Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 1:3 Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear, and who keep what is written in it, for the time is near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Soon&amp;rdquo; appears four times in this passage. The repetition adds to the sense of urgency and builds anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-228-9&#34;&gt;Rev 22:8-9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to me, but he said to me, &amp;ldquo;You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 1:17 When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he laid his right hand on me, saying, &amp;ldquo;Fear not, I am the first and the last,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See discussion at Rev 19:10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that John repeats worshipping angels suggests to some scholars that he may have been trying to indirectly address a problem of angel worship that had crept into the Asia Minor congregations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-2210-11&#34;&gt;Rev 22:10-11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near. Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy, and the righteous still do right, and the holy still be holy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel was instructed to seal up his words, possibly until Jesus &amp;ldquo;unlocked&amp;rdquo; them in Matthew 24:15 and John unlocked them in Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mat 24:15 &amp;ldquo;So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation is meant to be read and understood by his own generation and all subsequent generations of believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the evildoer still do evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thought is that God knows who the wicked are and who the righteous are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truly wicked are past the point of being able to repent from God&amp;rsquo;s perspective&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From our perspective, we don&amp;rsquo;t know that a &amp;ldquo;wicked&amp;rdquo; person we may encounter doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to receive an invitation from us to repent to move over to the &amp;ldquo;righteous&amp;rdquo; category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After studying the judgments and what will happen to non-believers, our hearts should be heavy for those who are perishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a veiled invitation here &amp;ndash;as if to say, after reading all of this, if you still wish to be wicked and filthy, you bear full responsibility for what happens next. If not, then be righteous and do right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 17 is a direct invitation for all who read these words and acknowledge that they are spiritually thirsty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to recall the sheep and goat judgment of Matthew 25, which we will look at below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-2212&#34;&gt;Rev 22:12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Behold, I am coming soon, bringing my recompense with me, to repay each one for what he has done.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 40:10-11 Behold, the Lord GOD comes with might, and his arm rules for him; behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him. [11] He will tend his flock like a shepherd; he will gather the lambs in his arms; he will carry them in his bosom, and gently lead those that are with young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 62:11-12 Behold, the LORD has proclaimed to the end of the earth: Say to the daughter of Zion, &amp;ldquo;Behold, your salvation comes; behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.&amp;rdquo; [12] And they shall be called The Holy People, The Redeemed of the LORD; and you shall be called Sought Out, A City Not Forsaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 25:29 For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-2213&#34;&gt;Rev 22:13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 1:17-18 When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he laid his right hand on me, saying, &amp;ldquo;Fear not, I am the first and the last, [18] and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 44:6 Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: &amp;ldquo;I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are distinctions in the roles and responsibilities between the Father and the Son, Jesus unquestionably identifies Himself as &lt;em&gt;Adonai&lt;/em&gt;, the I AM, the Aleph and the Tav.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-2214&#34;&gt;Rev 22:14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life and that they may enter the city by the gates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some scholarly debate as to whether verses 14 and 15 are from Jesus or John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who wash their robes will attain the resurrection of the dead and attain life in the age to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we see a special blessing poured out on martyrs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 7:14 I said to him, &amp;ldquo;Sir, you know.&amp;rdquo; And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that life in the age to come is only for martyrs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus makes us all white as snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is written to those facing persecution as an encouragement to stand fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t have to be martyred to live a life as a sold-out disciple of Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we saw back in the seven letters, to eat from the Tree of Life means to enjoy eternal fellowship with Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-2215&#34;&gt;Rev 22:15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and the sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love dogs, but in the Bible dogs are often a pejorative term for gentiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly not the God-fearing, believing gentiles representing the righteous among the nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Mounce (author of the Greek textbooks used in conservative seminaries) says &amp;ldquo;dog&amp;rdquo; has the connotation of &amp;ldquo;religious corruptor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharmakos = sorcery. As Dr. Stern translates, &amp;ldquo;those who misuse drugs in connection with the occult.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are on the outside of the world to come; meaning they aren&amp;rsquo;t there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are not outside the gates trying to get in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wicked have already been dealt with and have no share of the world to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently not many from Washington DC will be in the age to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-2216&#34;&gt;Rev 22:16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify to you about these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An angel is speaking on behalf of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John received the entire testimony from an Angel not directly from Jesus (we saw that in Rev 1:1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the angel is quoting Jesus and talking about himself in the 3rd person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Root of David - Isa 11:1 There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Descendant of David - Jer 23:5 &amp;ldquo;Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-2217&#34;&gt;Rev 22:17&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Spirit and the Bride say, &amp;ldquo;Come.&amp;rdquo; And let the one who hears say, &amp;ldquo;Come.&amp;rdquo; And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires take the water of life without price.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 55:1 &amp;ldquo;Come, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; and he who has no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See discussion at Revelation 21:2-6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-2218-19&#34;&gt;Rev 22:18-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s curious given this warning that Revelation has the most textual variants of any book of the Bible. You think they would have been more cautious when copying!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike any other New Testament book, Revelation is given the same weight as the Torah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deu 4:2 You shall not add to the word that I command you, nor take from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God that I command you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I believe the warning is aptly applied to the entire Bible and one which we must keep in mind at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern Christian interpretation is prone to reading in things that the text does not say, and simultaneously ignoring things the text plainly says much more often than we may realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to pick at these little by little with the goal to bring people closer to God and his Son Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start every study with Acts 17:11 not to be cute, but to stress the authority of the Word of God over the words of any human teacher, myself included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal has been neither to add nor detract but to extract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the study we said there were over 800 cross-reference verses. I haven&amp;rsquo;t counted but my suspicion is that we ended up with well over that amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a partial list at Talmidimway.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all the death and destruction, Revelation is a book of hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is coming back quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quickly is the word where we get tachometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it happens, it will happen fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maranata is a good Aramaic word to know. It means &amp;ldquo;come lord&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;our Lord has come&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is one of the most ancient Christian prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you&amp;rsquo;re down or doubting or feeling squeezed by the world, I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll remember this study, and you might want to pray Maranata to remind yourself that you belong to Him, not the world. He is faithful and His words and promises are true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;matthew-25&#34;&gt;Matthew 25&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 25:31-46 &amp;ldquo;When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. [32] Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. [33] And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. [34] Then the King will say to those on his right, &amp;lsquo;Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. [35] For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, [36] I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.&amp;rsquo; [37] Then the righteous will answer him, saying, &amp;lsquo;Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? [38] And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? [39] And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?&amp;rsquo; [40] And the King will answer them, &amp;lsquo;Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.&amp;rsquo; [41] &amp;ldquo;Then he will say to those on his left, &amp;lsquo;Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. [42] For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, [43] I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.&amp;rsquo; [44] Then they also will answer, saying, &amp;lsquo;Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?&amp;rsquo; [45] Then he will answer them, saying, &amp;lsquo;Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.&amp;rsquo; [46] And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we claim to be His disciples, we need to follow His commands. Let us all continue to grow in deliberate discipleship so we are prepared for the day when we meet Him face to face!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rev-2220-21&#34;&gt;Rev 22:20-21&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He who testifies to these things says, &amp;ldquo;Surely I am coming soon.&amp;rdquo; Amen. Come, Lord Jesus! The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amen!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus receives a question from a group of Pharisees regarding divorce.  There were two groups of thought in the early 1st Century.  The prevailing view was that divorce was permissible for any justification the husband had. The minority view was that it was only permissible for matters of sexual indiscretion.  Jesus responds, generally agreeing with the minority view.  His response startles the disciples who exclaim &amp;ldquo;it is better not to marry&amp;rdquo;.  Jesus responds that in the absence of some physical malformation, one could elect to remain celibate for the sake of the kingdom.  The section concludes with the disciples trying keep Jesus safe from crowds, which resulted in preventing little children from accessing Jesus.  Jesus corrects the disciples&amp;rsquo; thinking and says &amp;ldquo;let the children come to Me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, A rich, young ruler asks Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life. Jesus says to keep the commandments, sell everything, and follow Him. The man went away sad for he had great wealth. Jesus says it is only through God that a rich man can enter the Kingdom. He then tells His disciples that their sacrifices for the Kingdom will be rewarded.  Jesus then tells the parable of the hired workers where the owner pays workers who only worked about an hour the same as those who worked all day, causing the later group to grumble.  Jesus again predicts his demise at Jerusalem and says the disciples will also drink his Cup of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Videos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part II: Matthew 19:16-20:28 | Mark 10:17-45 | Luke 18:18-34&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACTS 17:11 (The Bereans) received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this episode, we&amp;rsquo;re going to see that as a society, that culture had strayed a bit from God&amp;rsquo;s original intent.  Moreover, they fully believed they were interpreting the Bible faithfully regarding permissible situations for divorce.  Jesus is not just going to redirect them back to the Hebrew Bible, not just the Torah, not just Genesis, but Genesis chapter 1 shows God&amp;rsquo;s intent for marriage.  This is why Acts 17:11 must be first and foremost in our study.  It&amp;rsquo;s what Jesus did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the topics are probably familiar to us (divorce, and the man who is told to sell everything).  Let&amp;rsquo;s not let our familiarity be an excuse to not ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck Missler used to say that the greatest obstacle to truth was the assumption you already have it.  Missler also used to say, &amp;ldquo;where two people agree one is redundant.&amp;rdquo; these are familiar passages with familiar Protestant interpretations that tend to be repeated from one commentator to the next.  As usual, the commentators I am using for this series bring added clarity based on their study of the first century legal and cultural backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is value in legitimate academic inquiry and applying Acts 17:11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No condemnation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, of course, this is a sensitive topic, as many families are affected by divorce or are single parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps some of us realize we haven&amp;rsquo;t acted according to the Biblical model for marriage. Or we were a relatively innocent victim of a partner who acted unbiblically.  Or maybe there was a legitimate reason for our predicament other than our own sexual misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another good memory verse is Romans 8:1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is now, therefore, no condemnation for those who are in Jesus the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these words on divorce may pinch and the practical effects of divorce can&amp;rsquo;t be minimized, because of who Jesus is and everything he has done on behalf of sinners, you should not feel condemned as long as you are living in unison with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/map.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus has now left the fertile Jezreel and Harod valleys and has most likely crossed the Jordan to make His way down the East Bank towards Jericho.  This area, south of the cities of the Decapolis, was Jewish.  The terrain is such that water is more plentiful from the numerous brooks on the east side that feed the Jordan.  This area is the ancient Gilead, where the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and ½ of Manasseh settled.  And we use settled literally and figuratively.  They literally settled here (in the sense of settlers) because the land was pleasing to the eye and excellent for raising livestock (which is true).  They settled figuratively (in the sense of compromising; settling for less) because God wanted them to Enter and possess the land on the WEST side of the Jordan in the Land of Israel.  The &amp;ldquo;Eastsiders,&amp;rdquo; as my friend Dan Stolebarger, calls them were usually the first people picked off by armies invading from the North.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/tb010703126.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:left&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s return to our narrative.  At this stage, there is most likely a caravan forming of pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem for the Passover.  Says Schlegel, &amp;ldquo;One cannot overstate both the excitement and tension that accompanied Jesus on His way to Jerusalem for the Passover festival.  Every question, every word was loaded.&amp;rdquo; Many other events happened in this region.  At Sukkoth, right above where Box 8 is, Jacob built a house and made booths for his cattle.  This is where we get the name &amp;ldquo;sukkot&amp;rdquo; for the feast of booths, what we might know as the feast of Tabernacles in the fall.  Gideon was also in this area in Judges 8 after the rout of the Midinettes.  The most notable event was when Joshua led the Israelites across the Jordan on dry ground.  When the Israelites crossed the Jordan near Jericho, we are told the waters dried up all the way to Adam (Joshua 3:16), which you can see just below Box 8.  God commanded them to set up stones of remembrance in Joshua 4:3.   Some scholars speculate that it was those very stones John the Baptist was referring to when he said, &amp;ldquo;And do not presume to say to yourselves, &amp;lsquo;We have Abraham as our father,&amp;rsquo; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.&amp;rdquo; (Matthew 3 and Luke 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 20 likely takes place somewhere near Jericho.
&lt;img src=&#34;images/map.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Map of Judea and Perea&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they passed through Jericho, there would have been agricultural fields and one of Herod the Great&amp;rsquo;s palaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Matthew 19, Jesus tells his talmidim that those who left their fields will receive their rewards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Matthew 20, Jesus tells a parable about a man who owned a vineyard and needed workers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later, he will tell His talmidim that once they get to Jerusalem, He will be turned over to the gentiles and the leaders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not too much of a stretch to envision Jesus telling these stories as he passes near and references these geographic markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pharisees-ask-about-divorce&#34;&gt;Pharisees ask about divorce&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 19:1-3 / Mark 10:1-3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 19&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1 Now when Jesus had finished these sayings, he went away from Galilee and entered the region of &lt;mark&gt;Judea beyond the Jordan&lt;/mark&gt;. 2 And large crowds followed him, and he healed them there. 3 And Pharisees came up to him and tested him by asking, “Is it lawful to divorce one&amp;rsquo;s wife for any cause?”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1 And he left there and went to the &lt;mark&gt;region of Judea and beyond the Jordan&lt;/mark&gt;, and crowds gathered to him again. And again, as was his custom, he taught them. 2 And Pharisees came up and in order to test him asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?” 3 He answered them, &lt;mark&gt;“What did Moses command you?”&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish travelers in the first century AD usually traveled on the eastern side of the Jordan River because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this allowed them to travel in Jewish territory instead of Samaritan, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;freshwater springs are found on this side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schlegel also notes that these crowds probably provided Jesus a certain degree of anonymity from those who meant Him harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we&amp;rsquo;re told that the Pharisees wanted to &lt;mark&gt;test&lt;/mark&gt; him on the matter of divorce.  Here, the traditional Christian viewpoint is that the Pharisees are setting a trap for him.  As they were now back in Antipas&amp;rsquo; territory of Perea, perhaps they saw an opportunity for history to repeat itself.  After all, John the Baptist was arrested and ultimately beheaded when he spoke against the Divorce of Herod Antipas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;m never opposed to a good conspiracy theory, let&amp;rsquo;s look at what we are and are not told by the text.  Matthew and Mark indeed say they said this to &amp;ldquo;test&amp;rdquo; him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John 6:6, Jesus uses the same Greek word when he &amp;ldquo;tested&amp;rdquo; one of the disciples.  G3985 Pieradzo.  Do we honestly think Jesus wanted to set a trap for his disciples?  Actually, the word is used positively (legitimate inquiry, due diligence) and negatively (tempt to sin).  Paul encourages us to Pieradzo ourselves to see whether we are in the faith (2 Cor 13:5).  Abraham was Pieradzo&amp;rsquo;ed to offer Isaac (Heb 11:17).  In other words, without added context, the word itself is as neutral as our word &amp;ldquo;test&amp;rdquo; is.  We are simply not given enough context to conclude the Pharisees are up to no good, so I suggest we give them the benefit of the doubt.  I believe this is what God would have us do in any circumstance where we don&amp;rsquo;t have enough information.   As a side note, entangle, or snare is a different Greek word.  Keener points out that testing an extraordinary person&amp;rsquo;s wisdom was a common theme in the Old Testament.  He cited how the Queen of Sheba sought to &amp;ldquo;prove Solomon with hard questions&amp;rdquo; (1st Kings 10:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;rsquo;s a nearly automatic reaction for us to see the Pharisees as evil - I think some commentators seem to be as obsessed with taking out the Pharisees as bad as poor Elmer Fudd is with Buggs Bunny, which is why I jokingly sometimes say, &amp;ldquo;wascawwy Phawisees&amp;rdquo; to remind us not to take these overly negative views on the Pharisees too seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I repeat this a lot, but as I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through this study, now at lesson 37 of 54, one thing God has revealed to me is that I need to have a more charitable spirit and give others the benefit of the doubt if I don&amp;rsquo;t have all the facts.  That is a good lesson for everyone – especially currently where civil discourse is hard to come by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pharisees may indeed have been up to no good in this circumstance; in my view, though, it would be better to be wrong on the side of giving another grace and mercy than wrong on the side of incorrect and premature judgment and condemnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, there is an entirely plausible explanation for their question that doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve a sinister plot.  maybe they just wanted to know the answer to this critically important and controversial spiritual and societal question?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, note Jesus&amp;rsquo; Acts 17:11 response: in Marks version, he asks, &amp;ldquo;what did Moses write&amp;rdquo;; in Matthew&amp;rsquo;s version, He says &amp;ldquo;Have you not read…&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-responds-citing-moses&#34;&gt;Jesus responds citing Moses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 19&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;4  He answered, “Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, 5  and said, ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? 6  So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.” 7  They said to him, “Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?” 8  He said to them, “Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;3  He answered them, “What did Moses command you?” 4  They said, “Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and to send her away.” 5  And Jesus said to them, “Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment. 6  But from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’ 7  ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, 8  and the two shall become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two but one flesh. 9  What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteronomy 24:11 &amp;ldquo;When a man takes a wife and marries her, if then she finds no favor in his eyes because he has found SOME INDECENCY in her, and he writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends her out of his house, and she departs out of his house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener notes that historically, other ancient societies held that there must be clear grounds for the divorce.  He writes &amp;ldquo;a bill of divorcement is drawn up specifying these particulars, which if it follows the manner of other legal proceedings, would be reviewed by a body of elders and testimony would be given.&amp;rdquo; In other words, the original intent was NEVER any random or petty dissatisfaction.  A court had to decide whether the divorce would be granted. This high standard had eroded as the generations passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big question is &amp;ldquo;what does the Torah mean by &amp;ldquo;he has found some &amp;ldquo;indecency&amp;rdquo; in her&amp;rdquo; – traditionally and logically this refers to sexual impurity.  Keep in mind that Adultery was a capital offense.  When the death penalty could not be delivered, the Jewish law compelled a husband to divorce his wife – this was the underlying tension between Joseph and Mary when Joseph had resolved to put Mary away quietly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hillel and Shammai differ on divorce&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember we have mentioned that there were two primary Pharisaic schools of thought.  One was the House of Hillel, and the other was the house of Shammai.  They usually agree but when they don’t, they fought to the death.  It&amp;rsquo;s sort of like two different Baptist denominations.  Maybe one is Calvinist, and the other is Armenian.  They agree on everything else, but if you bring up fate versus free-will, there could be bloodshed.   It was sort of like that with Hillel and Shammai.  Hillel was generally more permissive (in good ways usually) while Shammai was narrower and more restrictive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shammai held that &amp;ldquo;unseemingly thing&amp;rdquo; should be interpreted no further than sexual impropriety.  &amp;ldquo;Hillel interpreted the &amp;ldquo;indecency &amp;ldquo;of Deuteronomy 24:1 as just about anything that the husband found disagreeable about his wife&amp;rdquo; including being a bad cook or even finding another woman more attractive.&lt;br&gt;
Even within the Hillel camp, Stern writes that there was a Rabbi Elazar who said, &amp;ldquo;When a man divorces his first wife, even the altar sheds tears, &amp;ldquo;So they were not unanimous even within one camp or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the permissiveness of Hillel sounds absurd by our standards but pretty much isn&amp;rsquo;t that the way it is today.  Anyone can serve papers at any time.  As I say often, we are not one to point fingers at their ability to compromise and justify our sin as something that is &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo;.  We are no different.  Just compare a TV show from the 60s to one from the 80s to one from today and you&amp;rsquo;ll see what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I&amp;rsquo;m inclined to give these Pharisees here some credit for pressing the issue.  I like to think that the reason they asked the question was because perhaps after a few decades of Hillel&amp;rsquo;s interpretation, they were starting to see the damaging effect a liberal position divorce was having.  If they knew anything about Jesus, they knew He was highly likely to take a strict and narrow interpretation.  Maybe they wanted him to say this &amp;ldquo;on the record&amp;rdquo;, which He did.  This is pure speculation on my part but it&amp;rsquo;s not outside the realm of possibility&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the Beginning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of the creation, He made them male and female (Mat 19:4)
And God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them&amp;rdquo; (Gen 1:27).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew or Aramaic, Jesus would have said something like מֵרֵאשִׁית  from the beginning&amp;rdquo; which is related to בראשִׁית &amp;ldquo;in the beginning&amp;rdquo; which is also the Hebrew name of the book we call Genesis.  So, Jesus could just as well have said &amp;ldquo;as it is written in Genesis, He created them male and female.  From this the sages came to an understanding that God&amp;rsquo;s design for a marriage was one man and one woman, inseparable (the two shall become one flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses never commanded divorce.  The Bible PERMITS divorce because it makes provisions and to a certain extent concessions for man&amp;rsquo;s fall and propensity to sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardness of heart certainly recalls God&amp;rsquo;s description of Pharoah during the 10 plagues and the exodus.  The Torah allows it, but it does not Will it any more than the creation of cities of refuge is intended to command and sanction manslaughter.   Divorce is contrary to God&amp;rsquo;s plan; however, when it happens, God&amp;rsquo;s law is prepared to direct us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener notes that &amp;ldquo;concession&amp;rdquo; was a legal category among Jewish teachers.  It is something that was permitted only because it was better to regulate the sin than to relinquish control over it altogether.&amp;rdquo; Divorce is going to happen even though it is contrary to God&amp;rsquo;s will.  We can&amp;rsquo;t pretend it won&amp;rsquo;t ever happen, so we need to make provisions when it does is the thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it has happened to you or someone close to you; God&amp;rsquo;s mercy and forgiveness is similarly available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a related and often problematic note, the same logic can be used for polygamy.  The Bible tacitly permits a man to have more than one wife (as was more common in ancient cultures), but from the beginning it should not be this way.  The standard for male believers today is one single lifetime wife.  The Torah creates certain parameters as a concession, but God never once says Polygamy is a good thing just like He never calls divorce good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-a-2nd-marriage-adulterous&#34;&gt;Is a 2nd marriage adulterous?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 19&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;9  And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;10  And in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter. 11  And he said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her, 12  and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Mark leaves out &amp;ldquo;except for sexual immorality&amp;rdquo; creates a curiosity.  Lancaster presents a couple of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One possibility is that Mark understood sexual immorality as a marriage failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, maybe Matthew was more interested in the Hillel Shammai distinction, but by the time Mark wrote, this was no longer an issue.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, Lancaster reports that attitudes on divorce began to shift in the mid-first century, likely as a result of the Master&amp;rsquo;s pronouncement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps Jesus is implying that divorce without remarriage is allowable for lesser reasons.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul supplies one of these reasons in 1 Corinthians 7:15 &amp;ldquo;if an unbelieving partner separates, let it be so&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Divorce &amp;ldquo;with the intent of&amp;rdquo; marrying another?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the thought we looked at in Luke a few lessons ago, where the Greek could be translated as &amp;ldquo;whoever divorces another for the sole purpose of marrying another commits adultery&amp;rdquo;.  Whereas today, a divorced partner may choose to remain single, that possibility was less likely in the ancient world.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, Jesus ultimate message seems to be that an illegitimate divorce (for whatever reason) meant that the divorce paper was not worth the paper it was written on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectively in the eyes of God if not man, the couple is still married.  Therefore, any sexual contact outside of that marriage would be inappropriate.  On the other hand, as Lancaster writes, &amp;ldquo;if the divorce had been issued for a legitimate reason, the divorce was then valid, and remarriage permitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adultery against her&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster considers the statement &amp;ldquo;adultery against her&amp;rdquo; one of the most radical Halachic statements Jesus made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First century Jewish women had little say in divorce and specifically did not have the prerogative to divorce their husbands.  With this said, most Jewish courts forced men to issue their wives a certificate of divorce if she had a legitimate grievance against him (and women were sometimes able to seek relief from roman courts to obtain a divorce).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless – Jesus is here holding husbands up to the same standards of marital fidelity.   Jesus is breaking with the common thought but not with the Torah.  The Torah &amp;ldquo;from the beginning&amp;rdquo; always held mutual fidelity as the Will of God.    Just like with the sermon on the mount, he is holding us all to a higher standard of behavior.  Keener agrees and says, &amp;ldquo;Because men could divorce women unilaterally, but women could demand a divorce only under certain very narrow conditions (and then needed the court&amp;rsquo;s help), Jesus&amp;rsquo; opposition to this sort of divorce is a defense of married women.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we&amp;rsquo;ve often said, it may be tempting to blame the Jews of Jesus&amp;rsquo; day for their legalism and bending rules to fit their circumstances.  I submit to you that we are no different in our ability to rationalize our personal choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;it-is-better-not-to-marry&#34;&gt;It is better not to marry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 19&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;10  The disciples said to him, “If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.” 11  But he said to them, “Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given. 12  For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the male-dominated society the disciples grew up in, Jesus words were shocking.  In their minds Jesus was potentially condemning these men to a lifetime of misery should they find some displeasure in their wives that fell short of sexual impropriety.   Many of us forget the covenantal nature of a marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This clearly made the disciples nervous.  Keener explains why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Jewish men took the right to divorce for granted.  To marry without an escape clause in case it did not work—parents arranged the marriages and partners did not always turn out as expected—made the prospect of marriage itself frightening.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A covenant is not supposed to be easy to break so conversely, one should not enter a covenant lightly.  The Hebrew word for making a covenant is literally the word &amp;ldquo;cut&amp;rdquo; (ka-Raht).  This is because in the Old Testament days, as the contract or covenant was being executed, they would typically sacrifice an animal.  The parties would essentially communicate to each other &amp;ldquo;if I fail to keep my terms of this covenant, let me be hacked to pieces like this animal.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disciples&amp;rsquo; reaction and Jesus’ response reminds me of Jesus&amp;rsquo; words on discipleship.  Marriage, like discipleship should not be taken lightly.  Maybe you need to go tend to your fields or bury your father first if you aren&amp;rsquo;t ready to join me.  You better count the cost because in a sense it can cost you everything.  Not everyone can receive this saying, but if you can receive it, you have no idea what tremendous rewards await you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eunuchs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These words regarding being a eunuch are a little troubling.  Jesus appears to be saying celibacy is a higher calling than marriage and if you can&amp;rsquo;t be a eunuch than you should get married.  There are several problems with this interpretation.  First, the Torah prohibits physical mutilation.  While many pagan societies castrated slaves both as a protection for the families they served and as a sign of loyalty on the part of the slave, this was never the case in Jewish society.  The Bible teaches that &amp;ldquo;it is not good for man to be alone&amp;rdquo; and God&amp;rsquo;s plan was one man and one woman from the Beginning.  He commands his people to &amp;ldquo;be fruitful and multiply.  “Rabbis were almost always married, and a good Jewish Rabbi would never espouse celibacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re about to read of Jesus&amp;rsquo; position on Children; how basically since He had no children of his own, ALL OF US are his children.  It would be difficult to place such a high value on children if he was commanding his followers to be celibate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern has an excellent summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Judaism has always considered marriage both normal and desirable-&amp;ldquo;The unmarried person lives without joy, without blessing and without good&amp;hellip;.  An unmarried man is not fully a man&amp;rdquo; (Talmud: Yevamot 62b-63a).  On the other hand, some branches of Christianity came to grant abnormally high status to celibacy (on this phenomenon see 1Co_7:1-40).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the calling and preferences of the individual, Yeshua allows that either the married or the single life can be one of service to God and humanity; and he takes care to minimize needless guilt on the part of those making the choice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also historically, the fact that segments of Christianity require celibacy, both in the past and currently, can trace its roots in the gnostic movement, which generally held that anything physical or material was sinful.  This is rightfully called a gnostic heresy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an exception, Jesus appears to be saying that the celibate path may be right for a very few individuals.  Lancaster guesses that Jesus avoided marriage for the sake of maintaining a constant state of ritual purity.  This is consistent with Paul, who recommends short-term abstinence, with mutual consent of husband and wife for the purposes of prayer.  On that note, I had a pastor (married of course) who liked to say &amp;ldquo;well…I can&amp;rsquo;t say I&amp;rsquo;ve never been called to that particular kind of fast.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disciples-rebuke-children&#34;&gt;Disciples rebuke children&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 19&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Luke 18&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;13  Then children were brought to him that he might lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked the people,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;13  And they were bringing children to him that he might touch them, and the disciples rebuked them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;15  Now they were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them. And when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disciple&amp;rsquo;s initial instinct is understandable.  With the throng of people that surrounded Jesus at times, we can see how they sometimes had to be bodyguards.  Also bestowing blessings may have seemed frivolous.  To Jesus, nothing like this is frivolous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;14  but Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.” 15  And he laid his hands on them and went away.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;14  But when Jesus saw it, he was indignant and said to them, “Let the children come to me; do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. 15  Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.” 16  And he took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands on them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;16  But Jesus called them to him, saying, “Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. 17  Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.”&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being the shortest Gospel, Mark includes many details the other writers don&amp;rsquo;t.  Here in verse 14, it says that Jesus was not just correcting the disciples, but he was actually ANGRY with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In part two when we get to the rich young ruler, Mark will also note that Jesus looked at the ruler and &amp;ldquo;loved him&amp;rdquo;.  No other gospel writer adds that detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be forthright; as I&amp;rsquo;m typing this and looking at this picture with my two sons now grown and away at college, I&amp;rsquo;m regretting the missed opportunities where I could have received my kids like Jesus does here.  But perhaps I can take solace in Jacob.  While he was pretty much a train wreck as a person and as a father, he was ultimately able to lay his hands on his grandsons, Ephraim and Manasseh and bless them.  Lancaster writes &amp;ldquo;similar to Jacob, when Jesus laid his hands on the children and blessed them, He demonstrated that although He remained unmarried and had no natural children, he nonetheless had MANY children&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode recalls an earlier time in Peter&amp;rsquo;s home where Jesus uttered nearly identical words about letting the children come to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener makes another interesting observation that I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen anywhere else, he&amp;rsquo;s good at that.  He writes, &amp;ldquo;Insensitive disciples trying to keep from the master those seeking his help might remind Jewish hearers of Gehazi, a disciple of Elisha who eventually lost his position&amp;rdquo; This struck me hard.  And I need to explain why.  Last lesson we mentioned an event where Naaman the Syrian sought an audience with Elisha who refused, sending an instruction by way of his servant.  That servant was Gehazi.  After Naaman was healed, he wanted to bestow some gift upon Elisha.  Again, Elisha refused.  Gehazi decided that the boss would never find out if I went to Naaman and accept the tribute, so he did.  This is too good, so I must read it:  &lt;click&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s possible to be second in command to a man of God and none of that rubs off on you.  That was Gehazi&amp;rsquo;s case.  In the disciples’ case, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to walk in Jesus&amp;rsquo; dust and still not have a heart for the things he has a heart for.  That&amp;rsquo;s me in a lot of areas.  This pinches quite a bit.   For you it may or may not be children, but it may be something else.  What areas of your life do you know you are not acting like Jesus would act?  &lt;click&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In context, when Jesus says, &amp;ldquo;Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.&amp;rdquo; he is likely referring to the lowly social status of a child as opposed to any specific behavior trait.  Although Children were and are to be cared for and raised to be mature adults, a child occupies the lowest position in society (whether they like it or not).  This is true even today, where a child doesn&amp;rsquo;t obtain the majority of his or her constitutional rights until the 18th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many of our kids would probably disagree with this, Lancaster says, &amp;ldquo;to become like a child is to set aside concerns of prestige, to relinquish one&amp;rsquo;s personal dignity and prerogatives, and to accept the lowest place at the table.  The one who truly humbles himself and considers others more important than himself is the one who will find himself first in the kingdom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like we studied last time; we do not present Jesus our own righteousness.  Like a child who must rely on a parent or guardian, we must rely on Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;16  And behold, a man came up to him, saying, “Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;17  And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;18  And a ruler asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we meet a man who tends to get the back of the hand from commentators. This treatment may be justified but perhaps not for the typical reasons offered.  Let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can dig deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;rsquo;s accentuate the positives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note the man RAN to meet Jesus and showed a high degree of respect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He assumed the resurrection - we take this for granted, but it was not necessarily a decided issue back then (Pharisees vs. Sadducees)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He likely asked other rabbis but was told he&amp;rsquo;s in the club because he&amp;rsquo;s Jewish.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_Potentially, something about this answer didn&amp;rsquo;t satisfy him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He was a diligent Bible student and attempted to be obedient to the commands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most importantly, he CAME TO JESUS!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when he asks, &amp;ldquo;What must I do?&amp;rdquo;, this is our first &amp;ldquo;tell&amp;rdquo; that something is off is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will learn in a couple of verses that the man was well-versed in the Torah, yet, as Lancaster puts it, &amp;ldquo;The man had concluded that the words of the Bible we&amp;rsquo;re not adequate to assure him of the resurrection.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-do-you-call-me-good&#34;&gt;Why do you call me good?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 19&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Luke 18&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;17  And he said to him, “Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;18  And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;19  And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is behind Jesus&amp;rsquo; initial reaction to being called &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He could be trying to get the young man to see that Jesus = God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps the man’s assuming Jesus had some special secret is the underlying motive by Jesus’ adverse reaction to calling him &amp;ldquo;good.“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps Jesus is saying, “Do not assume I have something to add to what God has already said.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Hebrew, the phrase would be HaTov הַטּוֹב, &amp;ldquo;the good” or “the good one”.  This  is one of the Hebrew names for God.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observant Jews do not pronounce the Covenant Holy Name of God (the &amp;ldquo;Tetragramaton&amp;rdquo; - four letters) out of respect.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They typically will say &amp;ldquo;Adonai&amp;rdquo; (Lord) if in a religious setting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They will say &amp;ldquo;HaShem&amp;rdquo; (the Name), or another name like &amp;ldquo;HaTov&amp;rdquo; if in a less formal context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no recorded instance of Jesus using the Covenantal Name of God, but there are MANY examples where He uses a circumlocution, like He does here with &amp;ldquo;HaTov&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I recommend gentile Christians follow Jesus&amp;rsquo; lead and use a name other than the Tetragramaton when referencing God the Father.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;17   If you would enter life, keep the commandments.”  18  He said to him, “Which ones?”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;19  You know the commandments:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;20  You know the commandments&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and mine ordinances; which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am Adonai” (Lev 18:5, ASV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus enhances and clarifies the Torah, but He does add to or subtract from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus here gives roughly the same answer Abraham gave in Luke 16.  &amp;ldquo;They have Moses and the prophets.“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, the Bible is sufficient and contains the words for eternal life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Mark and Luke, Jesus is affirming that the young man already has what he needs to know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rom 3:28 For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Jesus says, “if you would enter life, keep the commandments,” this seems to contradict Paul in Romans 3:28.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that Jesus does not comment on whether this man or any other man can keep the Law to the degree required to attain eternal life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s merely answering the question he was asked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the Law is perfect; it is my sin that makes the Law a problem. The law can justify; it is my sin that prevents me from fulfilling the terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course Jesus was able and willing to fulfill those terms on my behalf. He kept the Law perfectly and extended His righteousness to us.  So the Law DOES have the power for us to inherit eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next Jesus says elsewhere, &amp;ldquo;if you love Me, keep my commands.&amp;rdquo;  This means the Law is no longer a &amp;ldquo;got to&amp;rdquo;, but a &amp;ldquo;get to&amp;rdquo;.  We follow His commands as a thank-you gift back to Him to show him we love Him and are appreciative of what He has done for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite popular protestant theology, not once does Paul dismiss the value of keeping the Law and commandments as a part of living a righteous life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that one did not have to undergo a specific requirement of the Law, namely circumcision and becoming fully Jewish (as opposed to a gentile God-fearer) to merit salvation. That is not the same as saying the Law is wrong and that people shouldn&amp;rsquo;t TRY to keep it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t expect our kids to be perfect and follow our rules all the time; but we you enjoy it and appreciate it when they do.  Maybe we even expect it.  They times they break our rules should be a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Horizontal Commandments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 19&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Luke 18&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;18  And Jesus said, “You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness,  19  Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;19 ‘Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.’”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;‘Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.’”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Jesus neither lists all commandments nor ranks them in importance.  His general point is that the Torah is sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew includes loving your neighbor while Mark adds, do not defraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love your neighbor (Lev 19:18) is viewed as a summary of the horizontal commandments (those between individuals, or “humanward” as Keener styles it).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s interesting that Jesus only includes commandments from this category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love the Lord your God (Deut 6:5) summarizes the vertical/Godward commandments between the individual and God.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example. “you shall have no other gods before me” and “honor the Sabbath day” are &amp;ldquo;vertical&amp;rdquo; commandments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus does not list any of these, &lt;em&gt;yet these are exacyly the ones the young man is missing&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While &amp;ldquo;do not defraud&amp;rdquo; is not expressly a commandment, it is not too far-fetched to understand that the Torah never sections fraud.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I love my neighbor as myself, that prohibits any theft (including theft of my neighbor’s good name, i.e., gossip).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;all-these-i-have-kept&#34;&gt;All these I have kept&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Luke 18&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;20  The young man said to him, “All these I have kept. What do I still lack?”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;20  And he said to him, “Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;21  And he said, “All these I have kept from my youth.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Keener says that a “young” man could have been between 24 and 40 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The young ruler does not state that he kept the commandments with sinless perfection.&lt;br&gt;
Perhaps this is implied, but maybe it is not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus does not condemn the man for being self-righteous, nor does he attempt to correct the young man&amp;rsquo;s thinking that keeping the law could get him eternal life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener also noted that most Jewish people could claim to have kept the specific commandments mentioned.  This might explain Jesus’ non-reaction to his claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-loved-him&#34;&gt;Jesus Loved Him&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark 10:21  And Jesus, looking at him, loved him&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s interesting that many Christians are quick to condemn the rich young ruler, but here we&amp;rsquo;re told that Jesus loves him.  If we&amp;rsquo;re denigrating something or accusing someone Jesus loves, we might be on the wrong side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many of us would willingly volunteer to sell all our possessions?  I don’t think very many. It’s easy to point fingers when not looking into the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the subject of Jesus loving the young man, another Hebraic New Testament commentator, John Lightfoot, wrote, &amp;ldquo;This man pleased Jesus, both in his question and answer. He both earnestly inquired concerning attaining eternal life and seriously professed that he addicted himself to God&amp;rsquo;s Commandments with all care and circumspection.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;WAS MARK THE RICH YOUNG RULER?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only Mark records the statement about Jesus loving him.  This has led some to speculate that the rich young ruler might have been none other than Mark himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark 14:51-52 also mentions a young man who was with Jesus at Gethsemane
He was wearing nothing but a linen cloth. When the guards tried to seize him, all they got was the cloth, and he ran away naked. This, also, is only mentioned in Mark’s gospel.  Was this &amp;ldquo;young man&amp;rdquo; also Mark?  If both &amp;ldquo;young men&amp;rdquo; are actually the same Mark, this indicates that despite initially going away sad, he did eventually become a disciple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, in Acts 15:37-39 Barnabas wants to bring Mark along on a journey but Paul objects.
Evidently Mark bailed out on a prior occasion, so in Paul&amp;rsquo;s mind, he was unreliable.  The Greek implies that Paul and Barnabas nearly came to blows!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then near the end of Paul&amp;rsquo;s life, writing in 2 Timothy 4:11, Paul asks for Mark because he is &amp;ldquo;useful to me for ministry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We all have our ups and downs spiritually; but we need to be persistent and finish well like Mark.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 19&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Luke 18&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;21  Jesus said to him, “If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” 22  When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;21  And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, “You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” 22  Disheartened by the saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;22  When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” 23  But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster notes a subtle nuance between the traditional view that the man was trying to earn his way into heaven by good works and what might have been the man&amp;rsquo;s underlying thought process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that culture, an outstanding charitable deed was a testimony of the character of one who performs it. In other words, acts of love and kindness express true repentance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might say that he asked (according to Matthew) or told (according to Mark and Luke) exactly how he could store up treasures in heaven, not to GET &amp;ldquo;saved&amp;rdquo;, but as a testimony that he already WAS &amp;ldquo;saved.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the phrase “you will have treasures in heaven, and come follow me” is included in all three accounts.  As we said earlier, we should obey His commandments and store up treasure in heaven BECAUSE we are saved; not to GET saved
With this in mind, I don’t think Jesus was being disingenuous or sarcastic in the slightest. Jesus gave the man a chance to become his disciple – to drop everything and follow Him.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, it was a severe and radical test Jesus was posing. Did the disciple value his “good” teacher over earthly possessions? Was he able to demonstrate his claim to love his neighbor as himself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man declined. The cost of following Jesus was just too high for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the text does not support that Jesus was establishing a mandate for all disciples. Many of his disciples were likely well to do. We looked at Mary, Martha, and Lazarus two lessons ago. From the descriptions, we can conclude that they were well-off&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, recall the accusation of Mary that she should have sold her perfume instead of using it to anoint Jesus; in that circumstance, Jesus said she had done a good thing. If the bar for discipleship was to sell everything, we can presume Jesus would have told Mary to sell the expensive perfume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did not ask Peter to sell his waterfront property and turn his family out on the street.
Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathea, and Mary Magdalene were all wealthy, yet they were never asked to sell everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with that said, Jesus identified the thing that had a hold on the young man&amp;rsquo;s life.  What things have a hold on our lives that Jesus would ask us to &amp;ldquo;sell&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell all to be perfect?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 19:21  Jesus said to him, “If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A casual reading might leave one with the impression that &amp;ldquo;the man asked, &amp;ldquo;What do I need to do to get into heaven?&amp;rdquo; Jesus replied, &amp;ldquo;sell everything, and you can get into heaven.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus saying this would have been antithetical to the gospel message, so (assuming our understanding of the Gospel message is correct), we can reject this conclusion. We can&amp;rsquo;t do anything on our own to merit salvation, including selling all our belongings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned that Jesus did not ask other disciples to sell everything, so Jesus was not establishing a condition for eternal life when he told the man to sell everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many commentators point out, and I agree that Jesus was highlighting the man&amp;rsquo;s covetousness in this instance. His affluence, or more specifically, his RELIANCE ON and ATTACHMENT TO his wealth, made it impossible to walk after Yeshua in the way of discipleship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after chewing on this, my interpretation is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The young man was asking for a good deed that would reflect his character and repentant heart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus replies, “in your case, such a deed that would demonstrate your repentance would be for you to sell everything and become my disciple.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The man concluded he could not part with his wealth and be obedient to Jesus in discipleship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This revealed that the man actually did &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; keep all the commands because he didn&amp;rsquo;t love his poor neighbors as much as he loved himself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Jesus was telling him he had to pick one master to serve, and he made his choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as you can see, this is a much more complex question than a Jew thinking he can earn his salvation and Jesus sternly correcting his legalistic mindset.  I suspect that Jesus was as sad as the man who went away sad. When someone you love makes a poor decision, it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember our premise: every person Jesus interacts with is in some sense you and me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could be keeping or hindering us from effective discipleship? In what ways is Jesus asking you and me to demonstrate that we only serve him and not the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For us, the question may not be, &amp;ldquo;what percentage (up to 100%) should I give?&amp;rdquo; But &amp;ldquo;how much more can I give?“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener has an excellent take-away:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The kingdom is not meant to be an extra blessing tagged onto a comfortable life; it must be all-consuming, or it is no longer the kingdom. For that reason, it appeals more readily to those with less to lose.” – Craig Keener&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;23  And Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. 24  Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;23  And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How difficult it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!” 24  And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, “Children, how difficult it is to enter the kingdom of God! 25  It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;24  Jesus, seeing that he had become sad, said, “How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! 25  For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the story about pushing a camel through &amp;lsquo;Eye of the Needle&amp;rsquo; gate in Jerusalem true?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/mat04998.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;eye of the needle&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:left&#34;/&gt;
There&#39;s a story that is often told in conjunction with this passage.  One of the gates in Jerusalem&#39;s walls had a small door that would let only pedestrians through after the main gate was closed at night.  If one had a packed camel, the only way to get the camel through was to remove all the tack and supplies, have the animal get on its knees, then shove it through the small opening.  Conveniently, so the story goes, this small door had the nickname, &#34;the eye of the needle&#34; and therefore, this is what Jesus was referring to in order to illustrate the extreme difficulty of a camel going through the eye of the needle.
&lt;p&gt;While in many circumstances, we can glean a lot from studying the first century context (in general this is precisely the point of talmidimway.org); however, there is one problem.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This story is simply not true&lt;/em&gt;.  There is no historical or archeological evidence for a gate known as the &amp;ldquo;eye of the needle&amp;rdquo; in the 1st Century. It&amp;rsquo;s an urban legend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, it misses the point entirely. The story would have us think that a man, with great effort (like it takes to push a camel through a small space), can enter the kingdom.  He was using an expression, similar to &amp;ldquo;when pigs fly&amp;rdquo; in English.  It defies the laws of physics.  It&amp;rsquo;s never going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus first says it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;difficult&amp;rdquo; for a wealthy person to enter, but then He says, &amp;ldquo;well actually, it&amp;rsquo;s impossible.&amp;rdquo;  With man a rich man oras a literal camel going through the literal eye of a literal needle.&amp;rdquo;  Fortunately for us, there there&amp;rsquo;s good news.  Keep reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 19&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Luke 18&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;25  When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, “Who then can be saved?” 26  But Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;26  And they were exceedingly astonished, and said to him, “Then who can be saved?” 27  Jesus looked at them and said, “With man it is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;26  Those who heard it said, “Then who can be saved?” 27  But he said, “What is impossible with man is possible with God.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disciples were somewhat taken aback by this (if you notice, that has been happening a lot lately). In that culture, wealth indicated God&amp;rsquo;s apparent blessing.  Even more than that, the wealthy you gave to charity.  They provided for the synagogues.  They underwrote the temple and many of the sacrifices.  Today, our churches and synagogues couldn&amp;rsquo;t survive without donations from those with financial means.  It costs money to keep the lights on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the disciples had to be doubly surprised when Jesus repeated the statement.  I suspect because they were NOT originally asked to sell everything &amp;ndash; as we shall see, they left everything but did not necessarily SELL everything &amp;ndash; they might have felt they were now on shaky ground from a salvation perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love what they say here.  They don&amp;rsquo;t just ask how a rich person can be saved, they want to know how ANYONE CAN BE SAVED.  It&amp;rsquo;s like they knew Romans 3:23:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 3:23 For ALL have sinned and fallen short of the Glory of God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supernatural intervention is required for ANYONE to be saved.  With God, all things are possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men cannot achieve eternal life and entrance to the Kingdom without God&amp;rsquo;s divine intervention&amp;rdquo; interestingly, the Jewish midrash contains similar teachings, including a reference to the eye of a needle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holy one, blessed be He, said to Israel, &amp;ldquo;my sons, if you give me an opening of repentance no more significant than the size of the eye of a needle, I will widen it into a gap through which wagons and carriages can pass. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again this is not from the Bible, but I view it as a similar expression to having &amp;ldquo;faith the size of a mustard seed.&amp;rdquo;  God is the one who can move mountains.  God is the one who can save.   Our work, in a sense, is repentance and devotion to Yeshua, our Master, following him in the &amp;ldquo;Talmidim Way&amp;rdquo; - the way of discipleship. We give him that, and he takes us the rest of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, those with wealth have unique spiritual obstacles (and if you have a computer with internet access to read this, you&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;rich&amp;rdquo; compared to the rest of the world). Often, it is only with supernatural intervention that the affluent can control their wealth instead of the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saved by an M&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 1:26 For consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck Missler used to tell a story attributed to the Countess of Huntingdon (18th Century):  &amp;ldquo;Blessed by God, it does not say, &amp;lsquo;&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;ny mighty,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;ny noble.&amp;rsquo; It says &amp;rsquo;not &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;any mighty, not &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;any noble.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I owe my salvation to the letter &amp;lsquo;M.&amp;rsquo;  If it had  been &amp;rsquo;not &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;ny noble,&amp;rsquo; where would I have been?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to her, she was saved by that M.  If we have any amount wealth and material goods, we are saved by that &amp;ldquo;M&amp;rdquo; too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;27  Then Peter said in reply, “See, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?” 28  Jesus said to them, “Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;28  Peter began to say to him, “See, we have left everything and followed you.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;28  And Peter said, “See, we have left our homes and followed you.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apostles left their livelihoods to follow Jesus. Many of them were fishermen by trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps feeling unsettled, they &amp;ldquo;remind&amp;rdquo; Jesus that they left their jobs, most possessions, and families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, they may have left everything, but they evidently didn’t actually SELL everything.  After the resurrection, during what was an apparent lull in the action between the resurrection and the ascension, several went back to their fishing gigs at the Sea of Galilee.  This is recorded in John 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While all three gospels go on to discuss Jesus&amp;rsquo; response to Peter saying they left everything, Matthew adds that the disciples will sit over the 12 thrones, judging the 12 tribes.  To be placed over the 12 tribes was a tremendous honor and as mind-blowing as Jesus’ many other teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This promise has its fulfillment in Revelation 21:10-14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With verses like this, it is surprising to see that so-called “Replacement Theology” still has any proponents.  Replacement theology holds that God has cast out Israel because Israel rejected her Messiah and now deals exclusively with the church.  But not only does it have proponents, but it also remains the dominant belief throughout the Church, both protestant and Catholic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the very fact that God is not done with Israel is the entire reason there are 12 apostles in Matthew 10 and the reason that they were compelled to maintain that number in Acts 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;29  And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name&amp;rsquo;s sake, will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life. 30  But many who are first will be last, and the last first.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;29  Jesus said, “Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel, 30  who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life. 31  But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;29  And he said to them, “Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God, 30  who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the age to come eternal life.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that Mark says the scope is not just those who leave everything, but those who leave everything AND endure persecutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming Talmidim, disciples of Jesus is that good deed the rich ruler declined.  It reflects a changed heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus says his Talmidim have rewards both in this world And the age to come.  We don’t expect rewards in the age to come to be material, so we should not expect rewards in this age always to be material.  Of course, Judas reminds us that promised rewards can later be forfeited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No sacrifice for the Kingdom goes uncompensated. This promise is good to remember when we offer gifts or go through trials that few, if any, seem to notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the chapter breaks are man&amp;rsquo;s inventions.  The parable in Matthew 20 is directly related to Peter&amp;rsquo;s question and Jesus&amp;rsquo; response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-parable-of-the-workers&#34;&gt;The parable of the workers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 20&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1  “For the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. 2  &lt;mark&gt;After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day&lt;/mark&gt;, he sent them into his vineyard. 3  And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the marketplace, 4  and to them he said, ‘You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you.’ 5  So they went. Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the same. 6  And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing. And he said to them, ‘Why do you stand here idle all day?’ 7  They said to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You go into the vineyard too.’&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favorite parables.  The Holy Spirit reminds me of it whenever I have any sense of envy or questioning of those in authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to having the familiar “the kingdom is like…” beginning, we would categorize this as one of the “last shall be first” parables dealing with a divine reversal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verse 2, we get the sense that there had been some negotiation on their wages.  This group wanted to make sure they got what was theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verse 4, the owner says “whatever is right, I will give you”.  These workers were, naturally, expecting something less than a full day’s wage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add to the drama, those still around the marketplace late in the day were often idlers not all that interested in work; and possibly they didn’t work that hard during the last hour of the day.  Even though this is just a parable and not an actual event, it’s reasonable to ask why these “workers” didn’t make their services available earlier in the day when the owner presumably would have hired them.  All of this makes the reversal at the end of the parable that much more “unfair” for those who started early in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the Hebrew idiom for selfishness.  It’s called “having a bad eye.”  Conversely, having a good eye means being generous, forgiving, and charitable.  You might recall we talked about this during the lessons on the Sermon on the Mount, when Jesus said, “the eye is the lamp of the body”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us all try to have good eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 20&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;8  And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, ‘Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first.’ 9  And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius. 10  Now when those hired first came, they thought they would receive more, but each of them also received a denarius. 11  And on receiving it they grumbled at the master of the house, 12  saying, ‘These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.’ 13  But he replied to one of them, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? 14  Take what belongs to you and go. I choose to give to this last worker as I give to you. 15  Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or do you begrudge my generosity?’ 16  So the last will be first, and the first last.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t this human nature?  Instead of minding their own business, some people like to sow irritation, division, and contempt.  If you don’t know what I’m talking about, hang out on Twitter for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must learn to be content with what we have and not worry about what someone else does with his money or possessions. Ultimately, it&amp;rsquo;s none of our business. The story is reminiscent of the Prodigal Son and the elder brother&amp;rsquo;s jealousy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Lancaster summarizes the parable as follows:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;King&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;God&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Laborers who worked all day&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The righteous&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;The laborer who worked only one hour&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A repentant sinner&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Wages&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;reward in the Messianic Age to come&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaning: In the Kingdom, the last shall be first, and the first shall be last.&lt;/strong&gt;  Or, as MacDonald in the Believer&amp;rsquo;s Bible Commentary, phrases it, &lt;strong&gt;it is better to leave our rewards up to the Master.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of salvation, entrance is at the owner&amp;rsquo;s sole discretion. The Thief on the Cross reminds us that some join late in the day while others join early in the morning
The Master has the prerogative to extend mercy and grace, even to those who don&amp;rsquo;t appear to us to deserve it. Those who came late in the day were just as repentant as those who came early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, salvation is unearned no matter who we are.  We are not in a position to judge whether anyone else merits it.  Like in the parable of the workers, it&amp;rsquo;s not our vineyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a saying that’s worth remembering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Heaven, there are people you&amp;rsquo;ll be surprised to see.&lt;br&gt;
In Heaven, there are also people who&amp;rsquo;ll be surprised to see you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poetically, this parable is another example of a Chiasm – a literary style where each verse or segment has a “twin” verse/segment that appears in inverted order. A Chiasm  begins with an “A” section, then a B section, then C, D, etc., followed by D’, C,’ B,’ finally ending with A.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;17  And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them, 18  “See, we are going up to Jerusalem. And the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death 19  and deliver him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified, and he will be raised on the third day.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;32  And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. And they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And taking the twelve again, he began to tell them what was to happen to him, 33  saying, “See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and deliver him over to the Gentiles. 34  And they will mock him and spit on him, and flog him and kill him. And after three days he will rise.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;31  And taking the twelve, he said to them, “See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished. 32  For he will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and shamefully treated and spit upon. 33  And after flogging him, they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise.” 34  But they understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they did not grasp what was said.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus was at this time going through Jericho, passing first through the population center near the spring (near Tell Jericho) and then traveling on past Herod’s palaces (also known as the “administrative center”) before making His way up the Ascent of Adummim, which leads to Jerusalem.  The lowest point of Jericho is 900 feet below sea level, while Jerusalem is about 2500 above sea level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Jesus’ third prediction of his betrayal and demise.  The first time was the “get behind me Satan” exchange with Peter at Caesarea Philippi, and the second was right after that in Galilee.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Herod the Great: a symbol of authoritarian brutality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herod the great was notorious for decadence and brutality. Although there is no extra-biblical evidence for the &amp;ldquo;Slaughter of the Innocents&amp;rdquo; as recorded in Matthew, the incident is entirely consistent with what we do know about Herod&amp;rsquo;s character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herod once ordered the drownings of the High Priest and several family members in the pool at his palace here in Jericho. On another occasion, Herod wanted to make sure the people of Israel mourned when he died. He ordered the executions of several popular Jewish leaders, because the people would have mourned over their deaths. Fortunately, the surviving guards did not carry out Herod&amp;rsquo;s execution order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Herod died, his sons and later the Roman procurators continued this practice of brutally oppressing the Jewish people, culminating in the two great Jewish revolts, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Jewish%E2%80%93Roman_War&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;first in 66 CE&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;second (the &amp;ldquo;Bar Kochba Revolt&amp;rdquo;) in 132 CE&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have to picture it.  Jesus is talking about suffering at the hands of those in charge as they were likely within sight of Herod’s palace where such suffering of innocent people often took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luke reminds us of the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. 31 . . . everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the evil Jesus is about to endure is part of a plan that was put in motion before time began and was documented in the prophets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;34  But they understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they did not grasp what was said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the disciples were not simply being “dense.”  They were supernaturally prevented from understanding these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sit-at-right-and-left&#34;&gt;Sit at right and left&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 20&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;20  Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came up to him with her sons, and kneeling before him she asked him for something. 21  And he said to her, “What do you want?” She said to him, “Say that these two sons of mine are to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;35  And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.” 36  And he said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?” 37  And they said to him, “Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This  request might not have been as outlandish as it first seemed.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James and John, along with Peter, were in Jesus&amp;rsquo; inner circle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a sense, they were already getting preferential treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite Jesus&amp;rsquo; ominous warnings, the prevailing attitude was that Jesus was about to usher in the Messianic Kingdom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salome may have been innocently requesting the seating arrangement at the messianic banquet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it was James and John directly, as Mark says, this is somewhat more puzzling
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus repeatedly told parables and gave instructions about how the first shall be last&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James and John, being part of Jesus inner circle should have known this better than anyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luke did mention that these things were &amp;ldquo;hidden&amp;rdquo; from the disciples, so perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s the excuse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;drink-my-cup&#34;&gt;Drink My Cup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 20&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;22  Jesus answered, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am to drink?” They said to him, “We are able.” 23  He said to them, “You will drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;38  Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?” 39  And they said to him, “We are able.” And Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink &lt;mark&gt;you will drink&lt;/mark&gt;, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized, 40  but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because no one anticipated Jesus&amp;rsquo; suffering (remember the Spirit prevented their understanding), Jesus informs her that she has no idea what she is asking. The adage is true - we have two ears and one mouth.  Use them in proportion!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus issues a prophecy of sorts. James and John would indeed drink Jesus&amp;rsquo; Cup of Suffering.
James was the first of the disciples to be martyred. John was the last of the disciples to die. Although he wasn&amp;rsquo;t literally martyred, according to tradition, Emperor Domitian sentenced him to death, first by poisoning, then by immersion into hot oil.  After he was miraculously spared, he was imprisoned and exiled on Patmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, we can envision Jesus passing the cup of martyrdom first to James sitting at Jesus&amp;rsquo; left hand.  Then the cup goes all the way around the table, with the other disciples suffering martyrdom, ending with John, who is sitting at Jesus&amp;rsquo; right side.  James died a martyr&amp;rsquo;s death while John lived a martyr&amp;rsquo;s life.  As the saying goes, &amp;ldquo;be careful what you wish for.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-ten-disciples-grumble&#34;&gt;The ten disciples grumble&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 20&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;24  And when the ten heard it, they were indignant at the two brothers. 25  But Jesus called them to him and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. 26  It shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, 27  and whoever would be first among you must be your slave, 28  even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;41  And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant at James and John. 42  And Jesus called them to him and said to them, “You know that those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. 43  But it shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, 44  and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all. 45  For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word of Salome&amp;rsquo;s request reached the other disciples, who were none too pleased with her request for preferential treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After just hearing a parable on how jealousy is inappropriate, this reaction is ironic.  As I like to say, we are no different.  Hearing Jesus’ words is a lot easier than living them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never underestimate Satan&amp;rsquo;s power, or just our pride, to sow division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes the catalyst will be the arrogant or misinformed statement of someone else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes, the catalyst will be misinterpreting something someone else said when no offense was intended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either Jesus redirects the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Son of Man came . . . to give His life as a ransom for many&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus challenged His disciples about the dangers of seeking earthly authority.  As our saying goes, &amp;ldquo;power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus would not have his disciples jockeying for power where they could abuse others; this is a warning the Church has not heeded for most of the past 2000 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talmidim of Jesus are to serve, not to be served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If necessary, we are to lay down our lives just as Jesus did.  If our master, who deserves to be a king was asked to lay down His life, how much more should we, who are not worthy of adoration be willing to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chuck Missler used to say, in Jesus’ organization chart, the CEO is at the bottom.  The last shall be first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we say “Talmidim Way,” that’s what we mean.  The way of being a disciple is to put ourselves last and others first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;study-questions&#34;&gt;Study Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your “take-away” from the story of the rich young ruler?  Meaning what would Jesus have you &amp;ldquo;take-away&amp;rdquo; from your life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you give your affluence over to God?  All of it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways do you thank God for making all things possible?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways do you need to have better “eyes”?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the parable, Jesus told the group hired at mid-day, “Whatever is right, I will give you.”  How can you apply this to your life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lesson is titled, &amp;ldquo;Zacchaeus and Bartimaeus&amp;rdquo; because of the healings, one physical and one spiritual of Blind Bartimaeus and Zacchaeus the wealthy tax collector.  In Luke, Jesus also gives the double-parable of the Minas (Pounds) and the King&amp;rsquo;s Return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson begins with Jesus passing through Jericho on His way up to Jerusalem for the Passover.  What Jesus knew, and what we, the readers, know, but what the disciples and others at the scene did not know is that this would be the final stop of His earthly ministry.  The most tumultuous and historically significant week in all of human history was about to begin, but first Jesus continues His mission to seek and save the lost sheep of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;35. As he drew near Jericho…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that Matthew and Mark say they were leaving Jericho, while Luke says they were drawing near Jericho need not concern us. Dr. Bolen writes, “it is apparent that Jesus was leaving the population center of Jericho (as recorded in Matthew) and entering the area of the Herodian city (as recorded in Luke).”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lesson takes place in and around the city of Jericho. Jericho is only about 15 miles from Jerusalem, but they couldn’t be more opposite in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/64e48fd0624a152b3cd6f2097b3af360.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Jericho&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jericho lies deep in the Jordan Rift Valley, around 900 feet below sea level.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare this to Jerusalem, high in the Judean hills at about 2500 feet above sea level&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Jericho, freshwater is plentiful from the many springs. It is known as the “city of palms” because it is very much an oasis in the desert.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jerusalem’s only source of freshwater, the Gihon Spring, can only provide water for a few thousand people per year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jericho commands the central east-west approach to Jerusalem, making it strategically important.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Jordan was relatively easy to cross near Jericho.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This factor contributed to the wealth of Zacchaeus, the tax collector who was able to tax people coming and going.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite having tremendous religious importance, Jerusalem is neither strategic nor wealthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Jericho Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empires from the Persians to the Romans used Jericho as an administrative center. Alexander the Great had a private estate here. Mark Antony gave Jericho to Cleopatra as a gift. As we noted last time, Herod the Great had a palace here, which would still have been in use as Jesus made His way through the city. Much like he did with Jerusalem, Herod expanded his “footprint” in the city with several public works, military buildings, a hippodrome/theatre complex to entertain the masses, and of course, his lavish private palace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Israel’s history, we know that Jericho is significant for being the first town Joshua and the Israelites could capture using a unique battle plan. Of significance for us is the town of Gilgal. This is where God made the Israelites stop, get circumcised (a very odd thing to do before a battle!), sanctify themselves, and celebrate Passover (Joshua 5:1-12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back even further, archeologists have unearthed artifacts that date to ~8000 BCE in the new stone age period – that’s 6000 years before Abraham. Historians believe Jericho is the oldest, continuously inhabited city in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The setting here is a little over a week before Passover. Crowds are beginning to swell. The beginning of the narrow Ascent of Adummim would have represented a bottleneck, with people backing into Jericho.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, primarily, but perhaps not exclusively due to Jesus, the expectation grew for a Messianic deliverer. Such hope is always higher around Passover, as the feast recalls Israel’s miraculous deliverance from oppressive Egypt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those who realized God sent Jesus had every reason to think a similar redemption was at hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Luk 18:35-43&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;th&gt;Matthew 20&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luke 18&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;29. As they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him. 30. And behold, two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!” 31. The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be silent, but they cried out all the more, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;46. And they came to Jericho. And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the roadside. 47. And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” 48. And many rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;35. As he drew near Jericho, a blind man sat begging by the roadside. 36. Hearing a crowd going by, he inquired what this meant. 37. They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.” 38. And he cried out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” 39. And those in front rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again, we note Mark’s attention to detail. He gives us the beggar’s name, Bartimaeus.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since others whom Jesus healed are usually unnamed, this might seem to suggest that Bartimaeus might have achieved some notoriety in the early apostolic community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark also translates the man’s name for his Roman readership who didn’t speak Hebrew or Aramaic. Bar in Aramaic means “son,” so the man’s name means the son of Timaeus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The healing is relatively straightforward, so it could be easy to miss some nuances.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark and Luke record that he is told “Jesus of Nazareth” passes by. ישׁוע (Yeshua) was a widespread name, but there is only one Yeshua of Nazareth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bartimaeus makes a messianic declaration when he exclaims, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” – in other words, this blind man could “see” better than most people of his day. Although he was blind, he saw Jesus clearly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their persistence is admirable. Do we shout louder for Jesus to help us, or do we give up at the first sign of the crowd telling us to be quiet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;

    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;One or two? Coming or going?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew and Mark say they were leaving Jericho, but Luke says they drew near Jericho. Matthew says there were two beggars, but Mark and Luke say there was only one. Which is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discussed the first question in the introduction. Jericho’s had two distinct sections: a population and a government center. They were about a mile apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, of the three authors, Luke would have been the least familiar with the geography of Jericho, and he was writing to an audience that would not have necessarily had any familiarity with the region. Perhaps he got this minor detail wrong. If so, insignificant discrepancies such as these need not concern us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to whether one versus two blind people were healed, this is similarly a non-issue, in my opinion. Matthew occasionally says multiple people were involved in an incident when Mark and Luke discuss only one person. Matthew was an eyewitness to these events, whereas the other writers may have edited their stories to focus on the most significant individual. Further, Mark does not say there was “only Bartimaeus.” We can easily reconcile this. They came upon two blind men, one of whom was named Bartimaeus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember that the Books of the Bible are not transcripts of every event that happened. They are carefully edited and revised narratives. They are stories designed to get at the essence of a particular event. Then perhaps they were changed and edited some more as the years passed, leading up to the point at which they were canonized (finalized).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These minor discrepancies are significant for one huge reason: they demonstrate a lack of coordination and collaboration among the gospel writers. If multiple witnesses’ testimonies match too closely, people become suspicious that they might have gotten together beforehand to concoct a cover story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of chronology, Lancaster sees this event as happening after the episodes with Zacchaeus as they were leaving Jerusalem and starting the Ascent of Adummim leading up to Jerusalem. Beggars would have been more “successful” here, where a crowd of people would be converging for the pilgrimage, then elsewhere in the middle of Jericho. Specifically, Lancaster places the event &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; “they came to Jericho” in Mark 10:46, but &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; “And as he was leaving Jericho.” in the same verse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;td&gt;32. And stopping, Jesus called them and said, “What do you want me to do for you?” 33. They said to him, “Lord, let our eyes be opened.” 34. And Jesus in pity touched their eyes, immediately recovered their sight, and followed him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;49. And Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” And they called the blind man, saying to him, “Take heart. Get up; he is calling you.” 50. And throwing off his cloak, he sprang up and came to Jesus. 51. And Jesus said to him, “What do you want me to do for you?” And the blind man said to him, “Rabbi, let me recover my sight.” 52. And Jesus said to him, “Go your way; your faith has made you well.” And immediately, he recovered his sight and followed him on the way.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;40. And Jesus stopped and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him, 41. “What do you want me to do for you?” He said, “Lord, let me recover my sight.” 42. And Jesus said to him, “Recover your sight; your faith has made you well.” 43. He immediately recovered his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;opened-eyes&#34;&gt;Opened Eyes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They knew what they needed.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He doesn’t ask Jesus for a few coins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He asks to be healed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How often do we ask for the &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; thing we need?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This time, there is no elaborate mud ritual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus’ touch is all the men need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus commends them for their faith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They immediately follow Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of healings have become commonplace in Mark. They have a double purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, Mark records selected events in Jesus’ ministry that demonstrated Jesus’ authority over the physical world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, as Lancaster says, these infirmities “symbolize the Master’s struggle with the spiritual impediments besetting His generation. These impediments prevented the people from repenting, recognizing the Messiah, and obtaining the kingdom.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparison-with-the-rich-young-ruler&#34;&gt;Comparison with the Rich Young Ruler&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster concludes the section with a table comparing the Rich Young Ruler to Blind Bartimaeus, which I have modified slightly&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jesus’ reply&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“Keep the commandments; sell everything.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“What do you want me to do for you?”&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Sad, causing others to wonder, “who then can be saved?”&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lesson&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;When we depend on our adequacy and our righteousness, we go away sad&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;When we humble ourselves enough to ask for mercy, we are rewarded for our faith in the Son of David. Our faith is about the best we can offer to Him. He has EVERYTHING to offer us.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;zacchaeus-the-tax-collector&#34;&gt;Zacchaeus, the tax collector&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 19:1-4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
1. He entered Jericho and was passing through.
2. And behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector and was wealthy.
3. He was seeking to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd, he could not because he was small in stature.
4. So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for Jesus was about to pass that way.
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/ad09ca3fccdb82076f4cf3d075fcbe64.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are told Zacchaeus was the &lt;em&gt;chief&lt;/em&gt; tax collector, yet he wanted to see Jesus badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This sets the stage for another “last shall be first” reversal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tax collectors were near the bottom of civilized Jewish society (See the call-out box below for further background).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most &amp;ldquo;sinners&amp;rdquo; would avoid someone who is seen as morally superior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zacchaeus was probably less than five feet tall, so he climbed something more like a middle eastern fig tree versus a North American sycamore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These trees have short trunks and branches relatively close to the ground, making them easy to climb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like it is today, climbing trees is seen as a child’s activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could say that by elevating himself, Zacchaeus was lowering himself in the eyes of others.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can draw a parallel to the prodigal son&amp;rsquo;s father.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was considered degrading for the patriarch of the family to run after anything, yet this is exactly what the father did in the story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wonder if both men, the father and Zacchaeus, aren&amp;rsquo;t a picture of our Heavenly Father who will overcome any obstacle to be with us.  Conversely, we should be more like the two men, removing any obstacles that get in our way between us and communion with God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;The taxman cometh&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zacchaeus was hated because he worked for the man…the Ro-man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jericho was a major administrative and tax center, as mentioned in the introduction. It was also a border town between Judea and Perea across the river. Unlike Joshua’s day, the Jordan was easily crossed in Jesus’ time. All of this made Jericho “one of the wealthiest cities of Palestine in the most fertile part of Judea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we introduced Matthew, we talked a bit about the system. They didn’t have actual, fixed tax rates. Whatever the tax collector could muscle out of the victim was fair game. It was a dirty business. If the collector thought someone underpaid his taxes, he had the authority to jail the citizen until he paid up. Further, they had something like a multi-level marketing scheme in which lower tax collectors had to give their bosses a cut. Zacchaeus was at the top of the pyramid, and he was loaded. It’s easy to see how the citizens considered Jews like Matthew and Zacchaeus traitors and thieves. Avoiding the taxman was seen as a duty among the faithful. As a result, tax collectors were ostracized from the rest of Jewish society. They were disqualified from serving as a witness in a trial. Because their occupation required them to be dishonest, they could never be trusted to tell the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, Himself, said His disciples should treat the unrepentant as if he was a tax collector. That is to shun him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Note: &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;friend-of-sinners&#34;&gt;Friend of Sinners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 19:5-7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
5. And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I must stay at your house today.”
6. So he hurried and came down and received him joyfully.
7. And when they saw it, they all grumbled, “He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.”  
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine all the people who wanted to see Jesus, like how our folks line the street of a motorcade today.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not only does he stop and call someone out for special attention, but that person also happens to be a hated tax collector!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luke has a number of these stories that juxtapose a repentant sinner with the murmuring of the self-righteous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zacchaeus would have been well known to the city’s people and not well known in a good way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why would Jesus choose to honor this lowlife?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any food he might serve Jesus would have been purchased with stolen money, making Jesus in some way complicit in the crime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zacchaeus was a symbol of all that was wrong with Roman oppression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zacchaeus was supposed to be ostracized, but Jesus isn’t playing by the rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversely, we can imagine the town’s religious leaders expected Jesus to dine with them.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe they had already started preparing their houses in the hopes that they would get to entertain this critical guest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, this event happened right around the time Jesus told the parable of the workers. Here, we see something very similar.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The “owner” of it all can choose to bestow favor on whomever he pleases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They didn’t like who Jesus chose, so they grumbled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep in mind that these people weren’t simply petty in their dislike for Zacchaeus. He was a thief.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They had probably all been victimized by him, and he made their lives harder than they needed to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus, of course, knows the end from the beginning, and he knows what is going to happen next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;teshuvah&#34;&gt;Teshuvah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 19:8-10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
8. And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold.”
9. And Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house since he also is a son of Abraham.
10. For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I imagine the grumbling people were quite surprised the next day when they got a knock on the door and handed a bag of cash, four times the amount that they had initially been paid!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They were ultimately quite glad Jesus spent some time with Zacchaeus!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Jesus gave him an ultimatum as He did for the Rich Young Ruler, it is not recorded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can take away from the text is that Jesus chose to honor an outcast, and he repented.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that he repented from &lt;em&gt;exploiting others&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on John the Baptist&amp;rsquo;s warning to a previous group of tax collectors, we should not necessarily assume that the man gave up being a tax collector (Luke 3:12-13).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hebrew word for repentance is &lt;em&gt;teshuvah&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As with many Hebrew words, action is implied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we with our &amp;ldquo;western&amp;rdquo; minds think of repentance, we might think of a chance of heart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a Hebraic mindset, that change of heart is always accompanied by action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this case, a good deed reflects repentance that started in the heaert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We touched on this last time with the Rich Young Ruler.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Zacchaeus’ case, his heart was right, so good deeds followed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the young man’s case, his heart wasn’t right despite his claim to have kept all the commandments Jesus listed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a potential that both exchanges happened on the same day, which would have highlighted the contrast in the disciples’ eyes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remuneration
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Torah assigns various levels of remuneration for theft depending on the circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zacchaeus gave himself the highest level: quadruple damages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;yeshua-has-come&#34;&gt;Yeshua has come&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Jesus says, “Today, salvation has come,” this is not because of the good deed of giving half to the poor and remediating with quadruple damages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salvation came because of his repentance, which was subsequently evidenced by the act.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zacchaeus would undoubtedly have been familiar with John the Baptist in this geographic region.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps it was one of Zacchaeus&amp;rsquo; direct-reports who met John the Baptist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While it appears Zacchaeus did not immediately repent at John’s words, perhaps a seed was planted that took some time to grow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to remember this when we don’t see immediate fruit from our ministry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There could be growth going on that we can’t see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is also a deliberate pun. Yeshua means salvation.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not only was Zacchaeus saved in the spiritual sense, Jesus, but the embodiment of salvation had also come to his house and was sitting across from him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Son of Abraham
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is also significant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He was one of the lost sheep of Israel, once thought to be beyond reach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet Jesus restores him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewish people of that day (like many nominal Christians today) believed they had salvation just by being Jewish.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, this could be forfeited by self-exclusion, such as becoming a tax collector or some other type of sinner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we entertain the fact that he remained a tax collector, this inclusion and restoration would have been even more offensive to those in attendance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recall previous lessons where we discussed the divine reversal, including the last lesson where those who showed up for work at the 11th hour (the repentant sinner) got the same wage as those who had been working all day (the lifelong believer).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-man-goes-on-a-journey&#34;&gt;A man goes on a journey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 19:11-12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
11. As they heard these things, he proceeded to tell a parable because he was near to Jerusalem and because they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.
12. He said, therefore, “A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note the last part of verse 11. They expected the political kingdom immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Journey parables have a common theme.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Man goes on a journey, yet before he leaves, he entrusts his operation to a group of servants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When he returns, typically unexpectedly, the owner demands an accounting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The righteous are rewarded while the wicked are punished&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the original audience, there may have been (at least) three layers of intended meaning:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, we are individually accountable in the absence of direct supervision
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul elaborates on this in Ephesians 6
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the Bible talks about &amp;ldquo;masters&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;slaves&amp;rdquo;, we need to substitute &amp;ldquo;employers&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;employees&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;clients&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;contractors&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, After His Resurrection, Jesus will be “away” for a while
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The disciples (i.e., you and me) are entrusted not only with keeping the operation moving but also delivering a return on investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When He comes again, not only will the wicked be judged at the Great White Throne Judgment, but those deemed righteous will have their works evaluated at the Bema Seat Judgment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third, Israel has not had direct supervison but now the King is returning and will audit the books
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, the parables possibly explain the coming judgment about to fall on Jerusalem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Through Moses, God had delivered to the people a perfect system for keeping in communion with Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In many ways, the Torah is written like a contract; it promises life to those who fulfill the terms and death to those who do not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now Jesus, in a sense, the “second Moses,” is returning to audit the books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If He found that generation had produced fruit in keeping with repentance, His arrival would have brought reward – the Messianic Kingdom would have begun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since He found that generation had failed to fulfill the terms, His appearance brings judgment – destruction, exile, and a delay of the Kingdom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These three would serve to communicate, albeit indirectly, that He is not the messiah, they’re looking for. There will be no immediate Messianic Kingdom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears Luke may have combined two parables into one. Both begin with “a nobleman went into a far country to claim his Kingdom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The “Parable of the Minas” is Luke 12-13, 15b-26.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The “Parable of the King’s Return” is Luke 12, 14-15a, 27.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both parables begins with a nobleman going into a far country to receive his kingdom. Keener points out, “Herod the Great (in 40 BCE) and Archelaus (in 4 BCE) each had to go to Rome to receive their right to rule Judea&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus’ audience would have immediately recalled this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When they heard the opening words of the parable, they would have thought, “oh, you mean just like Herod and Archelaus.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means, to the original audience hearing the parable, the protagonist in the parable was hated, wicked, and dishonest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we evaluate the parables, we need to keep in mind Jesus’ stated reason for telling them: BECAUSE THEY SUPPOSED THE KINGDOM OF GOD WAS TO APPEAR IMMEDIATELY.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;parable-of-the-minas&#34;&gt;Parable of the Minas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 19:12-15&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
12. He said, therefore, “A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.
13. Calling ten of his servants, he gave them ten minas and said to them, ‘Engage in business until I come.’
15. When he returned, having received the kingdom, …
15. … he ordered these servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by doing business.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A mina was roughly three months’ wages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As is the theme with “man goes on a journey” parables, the workers are given an unannounced amount of time to grow their investments.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although it is not stressed in this parable, in “Journey Parables,” the master returns unannounced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means the workers (or bridesmaids) should constantly be in a heightened state of preparedness and expectation regardless of the length of the absence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-audit&#34;&gt;The audit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 19:16-26&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
16. The first came before him, saying, ‘Lord, your mina has made ten minas more.’
17. And he said to him, ‘Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.’
18. And the second came, saying, ‘Lord, your mina has made five minas.’
19. And he said to him, ‘And you are to be over five cities.’
20. Then another came, saying, ‘Lord, here is your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief;
21. I was afraid of you because you are a severe man. You take what you did not deposit and reap what you did not sow.’
22. He said to him, ‘I will condemn you with your own words, you wicked servant! You knew that I was a severe man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow?
23. Why then did you not put my money in the bank, and at my coming, I might have collected it with interest?’
24. And he said to those who stood by, ‘Take the mina from him, and give it to the one who has the ten minas.’
25. And they said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten minas!’
26. ‘I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although ten servants were given a mina each, we are only told the audit results of three.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first two must have had good asset managers as the ROI (return on investment) was 1000% and 500%, respectively.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to one commentator, this return is too good to be true; therefore, we should understand and apply the meaning of the parable accordingly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They were then put in charge over much more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third wrapped up his mina in a scarf.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In that culture, wrapping up a sum of money and laying it away meant it couldn’t be touched.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;matthews-parable-of-the-talents-matthew-25&#34;&gt;Matthew&amp;rsquo;s Parable of the Talents (Matthew 25)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although the parables are quite similar, there are some key differences
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Matthew’s version, there are three servants, not ten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The currency is a “talent” (a talent is 6000 denarii – so 23-25 years’ wages – a significant sum!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of each servant getting equal, the three servants get 5, 2, and 1 respectively.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first two deliver 100% ROI (somewhat more reasonable than the return on the Minas)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These servants are told, “well done, good and faithful servant. You were faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Luke&amp;rsquo;s version, there is no &amp;ldquo;good servant&amp;rdquo; (although there is &amp;ldquo;failthful&amp;rdquo;), neither is there &amp;ldquo;joy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third servant responds much like the third servant in the Mina parable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of application, Lancaster concludes, “If the parable of the ten minas describes how equal opportunities can be used differently to achieve different results, the parable of the talents describes how different opportunities and resources can be used equally to achieve the same results.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;” Strikingly, the third servant is not merely reprimanded. Still, he is cast into Gehenna, where “there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” (Matthew 25:30)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prevailing view assumes the parable is roughly equivalent to the Matthew 25 version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The two were rewarded, and the one was punished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we are faithful in the small things, Jesus will reward us with more important things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As for the seemingly impossible rate of return, with man, this is impossible (at least without fraud or insider trading), but all things are possible with God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparation for this lesson, I came across two different views of the meaning of this parable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since both conclusions can benefit us as disciples, I will present them both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The alternative view is discussed at the end of the lesson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming the prevailing view, a takeaway of the parable would be that Jesus doesn’t want us coasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He expects us to produce good works if we are his disciples and servants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again, we do this not to get saved but because we are saved.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish scribes recount similar “faithful with small things” lessons with Moses and David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both started as shepherds leading literal, four-legged sheep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because they proved themselves faithful, God put them each over His people Israel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God tests us in small matters each day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some modifications, Lancaster’s conclusion of the Ten Minas is below&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;King = Messiah&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Journey = Messiah’s absence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Servants = disciples/Israel/you and me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minas = the work of the kingdom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faithful Servants = disciples focused on the kingdom work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfaithful servant = those who have neglected the work of the kingdom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reward = advancement in the kingdom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Punishment = loss of the kingdom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaning = Those faithful with the responsibilities entrusted to them will be rewarded at the coming of the Messiah. Those who are negligent will be punished.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;parable-of-the-kings-return&#34;&gt;Parable of the King’s Return&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
12. He said, therefore, “A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.
14. His citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We do not want this man to reign over us.’
15. … he returned, having received the kingdom, …
27. (and said) these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slaughter them before me.’”
28. When he had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/ae852c903db4cdf4484fba55dd9b9de6.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, hearers of this parable would have immediately recalled the Herodian ruler Archelaus. After Herod the Great died around 4 BCE, his kingdom was split among his sons. Like other famous, wealthy neurotics, Herod had multiple wills that needed to be sorted out. Antipas believed he should have inherited the title “King of the Jews” from his father. The Romans disagreed. Archelaus got Judea and Samaria, Antipas got Galilee and Perea, and Philip got the territory to the northeast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Passover, Archelaus slaughtered approximately 3000 Jews in the temple in Jerusalem&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Following this, a delegation of Judeans went to Rome to petition for relief. Ultimately, he was banished to Vienna, and the Roman Procurators’ age began. See map for these boundaries&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we assume the ruler in the parable(s) is supposed to represent Jesus, why would Jesus compare Himself to the wicked Archelaus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One explanation: as we have mentioned, Jesus’ parables often have flawed protagonists.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the lessons is “if a flawed human can do good things (like reward high-producing servants), how much more will perfect God do those things.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another possible explanation: for context, note He said these things as he was going up to Jerusalem.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He knew, but the disciples did not, that He will be rejected and hated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While we believers, do not view Jesus as an evil ruler, non-believers do not share our opinions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For our purposes, we can include the Jerusalem religious establishment in the category of non-believers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this respect, Jesus was hated just like this ruler was.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, in this second interpretation, the parable’s meaning is that judgment awaits those who oppose the kingdom.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If our image of Jesus is as a blonde-haired Scandinavian who goes around the shores of the Sea of Galilee patting children on the head, we may find these words startling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those people have never read the last few chapters of Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Jesus comes again, His enemies will be put down, and God wins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we said above about the “Journey” parables, Jesus’ first-coming, as well as His second-coming, are in view. Although they are “successful” at having Jesus cast aside, in about 40 years, the Romans will invade and slaughter the residents of Jerusalem. Those who survive are sent into exile. Either way, judgment awaits those who reject the rightful ruler. Jesus is also possibly dropping another hint that the Messianic political Kingdom will wait.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
As mentioned, Aubrey Taylor, writing in the “Lexham Geographic Commentary,” believes Luke’s version is not merely a retelling of Matthew’s Parable of the Talents. “When the setting of the parable is accounted for, it becomes clear Jesus is delivering a critique of exploitative power structures—not celebrating them as a model of discipleship.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument is compelling, so I submit it here for Acts 17:11 analysis. Also, perhaps both interpretations are valid. Parables usually only have one meaning, but they don’t always have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view hinges on the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;comparing the ruler in the parable(s) to Herod Archelaus, not Jesus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the too good to be true returns on investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the geographic setting: Jericho, in view of Herod’s palaces, on the way up to Jerusalem, where the Messianic Kingdom will NOT be initiated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the context of Zacchaeus repenting and refunding (with damages) his ill-gotten wealth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parable begins with a nobleman going into a far country to receive his kingdom, which Archelaus did a few years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above, we asked, “Why would Jesus compare Himself to the wicked Archelaus?” Taylor argues that He would not and did not intend to make that comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the economy of that day, “the very act of doing business for profit was considered immoral, the profit margins presented by the first to servants were downright evil.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike today’s economy, where a rising tide lifts all boats, it was seen as zero-sum in that day. If one person gained, that means another person lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In that culture, the nobleman would have been the villain, and the third slave would have been the hero!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The speculation is that the first two slaves would have had to resort to harassment and thievery to generate those massive returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m sympathetic to this view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even today, if someone showed those percentages of returns, we likely would assume that there were some shenanigans; perhaps the asset manager received an insider-trading tip or something like that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Taylor’s view, it was the third slave who acted honorably.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He did not lose any part of the initial investment. He wrapped it in a cloth for safekeeping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He did not directly disobey the wicked ruler, but he didn’t do anything to help him either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, in the fourth century, Eusebius referenced yet another version of the parable (in the now lost Gospel of the Nazarenes) where the third servant was &lt;strong&gt;rewarded&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taylor sees this interpretation as more fitting in the context of following the story of Zacchaeus, who gave away his ill-gotten earnings with Luke 19:11.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As they heard these things, he proceeded to tell a parable because he was near to Jerusalem and &lt;strong&gt;because they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, they wanted a national kingdom to replace Rome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to this view, &lt;strong&gt;Jesus responds that it would be absurd to establish the kingdom of God based on the model of Rome&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the first century, Israel’s recent history bore this out.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewish people rightly celebrate Hanukkah (as did Jesus Himself in John 10:22), where a group of rebels defeated the tyrannical Greek Seleucid empire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet only a few decades later, Israel’s own rulers, the Hasmoneans, showed themselves to be just as ruthless, inept, and just as corrupt as their Greek counterparts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In later centuries, Church history proved this as well.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taylor’s argument appeals to me because I give the most weight to what the original audience would have understood.   * What they would have understood is likely what Jesus meant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus would show us there&amp;rsquo;s going to be a different way.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He will enter Jerusalem not on a conquering horse but a humble donkey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“But, amid the crowds calling out for a king and a rescuer, He must have realized his message was falling on deaf ears.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll look at that entry in Lesson 39.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this said, the similarities of this parable to Matthew 25 can’t be ignored. The context of Matthew’s parable is a “good and faithful servant who enters into his master’s rest.” Luke’s parable is almost identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, while they appear conflicting, the two interpretations are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  In any case, we need to stay focus on kingdom work and not become complacent while Jesus is &amp;ldquo;away&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More applicable than the parable is we need to have the heart of Zacchaeus. We need to joyfully make it right when we are wrong because salvation has come to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lesson is titled “The Triumphal Entry” because we have finally arrived at the most significant week in all human history. The next seven days are a roller coaster of emotions, ending on the highest peak of all, the Resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 39 will be in two parts. Part I will review the Ascent of Adummim, which connects Jericho to Jerusalem. We’ll meet up with Jesus and the recently resurrected Lazarus in Bethany, look at how Jesus procures a donkey for his entry into Jerusalem, and examine the crowd’s reaction as they welcomed Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction-the-final-week-begins&#34;&gt;Introduction: The Final Week Begins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note about the “Final Week” – We are “only” in John chapters 11 and 12, so the last ten chapters of John deal with this week and post-resurrection. Lancaster&amp;rsquo;s commentary is a five-volume set. Each volume has around 400 pages. The Triumphal entry occurs about ½ way into volume 4. In other words, even though it looks like we’re nearing the end from a timeline perspective, we have a LOT of Gospel still ahead of us. Our format will take another 14 lessons to cover the events in the eight calendar days between Palm Sunday and Resurrection Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is undoubtedly the most influential and most personally significant week in all of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Luke 19:28&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And when he had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;these things&amp;rdquo; are the Minas and the King&amp;rsquo;s Returning parables we studied in Lesson 38.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/c4203840c06c77de695a847ff7bbc559.png&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photo&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; shows the ancient path that led the 18 miles (29 km) up from Jericho to Jerusalem. One always goes “up to Jerusalem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/2bafbd3f9ccec62efdf0eaf9ce825b36.png&#34; width=&#34;75%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chart comes from AD Riddle&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and shows Herod’s palace, Jericho, to Jerusalem. Presumably, the -720 is from the Herodian Palaces, west of the modern city and slightly higher. Modern Jericho’s height is listed at -864 feet, making it the lowest and the oldest continuously inhabited city on Earth. Today much of the Kidron valley has been filled in, so the elevation difference between that and Jerusalem is not as significant. Still, one had to be in excellent physical shape to make this trek. Today we do it in an air-conditioned bus with Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginning of the Following the Messiah episode 8 has an excellent segment about this ascent. Watch through 8:55.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8UaThqyEBzc&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;will-he-come-to-the-feast&#34;&gt;Will he come to the feast?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 11:55-57&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;55 Now, the Passover of the Ioudaioi was at hand, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves.   56 They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, “What do you think? That he will not come to the feast at all?”   57 Now, the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, he should let them know so that they might arrest him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the week leading up to Passover, Jerusalem would swell with Pilgrims. By some estimates, a population of perhaps a few hundred thousand could swell to 2-3 million. This helps explain several dynamics, most notably why the city&amp;rsquo;s leadership (both the Romans and the temple establishment) might be more on edge. It also makes locating one person in that crowd a non-trivial task.Ceremonial purification could take up to a week, especially if that person had come into contact with a corpse (Numbers 19). The Jewish Sages applied those same standards to any Jew living in a foreign country – gentile nations are inherently unclean. Remember this point when we get to Acts. This notion of ceremonial uncleanliness has a lot to do with the disciples&amp;rsquo; attitudes and reticence concerning dining with non-Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were looking for Jesus, meaning the people were wondering whether He would claim his Messianic title. The Passover/Feast of Unleavened bread was compulsory, so it would be very unusual for Him not to show up, especially since He only had to travel a relatively short distance from Galilee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public didn’t realize that “the game’s afoot,” as Sherlock Holmes might say. The Jerusalem &amp;ldquo;deep state&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot; had already decreed that Jesus needed to be taken out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;A Passover Seder&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/7f5926edfba1e6038c96b7bb867e4ffd.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get a chance to participate in a Passover Seder, you should take advantage of it. It is rich with Symbolism and Biblical history. Christians/Messianic Jews see additional symbolism that represents Jesus. For example, there are traditionally three pieces of Matzah wafers. The way it is baked, it has holes (like saltine crackers) and stripes. He was pierced for our iniquities, and his stripes heal us. Additionally, the 2nd of the three pieces is literally broken and “hidden” away until after the meal. Most Jews will tell you they don’t know why this is. Christians may have a better idea as this speaks of Jesus&amp;rsquo; Resurrection, where He is absent for a time, and we await rejoining Him at the Marriage Supper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note Jesus and other 1st Century Jews did not celebrate the Passover the way Jewish people observe the festival today. However, the Last Supper accounts in the Gospels record several themes and practices with today’s Passover Seder. The use of the Seder plate is a post-biblical tradition, but it serves as a helpful illustration of the traditional observance of the festival. Today’s traditional Seder plate includes a shank bone (replaced above with a piece of chicken), charoset (brown mixture), bitter herbs (lettuce), bitter herbs (parsley), egg, and a vegetable. The letters in the center of the plate are Pei Samech Chet (Hebrew is read from right to left). This spells Pesach. In many non-English countries, Easter goes by the name of Pesach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Precise dating of this week is difficult&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;table&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1** Six days before the Passover, Jesus, therefore, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.**&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John 12:1, dating these events in the final week is a problem. We are not told precisely what year all this went down, so we must do our best with what we know. Some scholars believe this is 32 CE/AD because of a prophecy in Daniel 9, which we will discuss in Part II. Other scholars land on 33 or 30 CE/AD because, in these years, the date of the Passover meal would have been on a Thursday with his crucifixion on a Friday. There is strong traditional evidence that the crucifixion was on a Friday, but some scholars are not convinced. We will have to save this discussion for a later lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even here in John 12:1, while most scholars believe John meant six days before Nissan 14, the Passover sacrifice, some believe he told six days before Nissan 15, the Passover meal ushering in the seven-day feast of unleavened bread.  This is further complicated by John&amp;rsquo;s placing the perfume anointing story six days before the Passover, while Mark says it was two-days before.  There is some suggestion John may have been using a different calendar than the Synoptic Gospel writers, but that may not fully explain the perfume discrepancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If none of these dating discrepancies bothers you and you don’t care because you’re just glad Jesus died for your sins and rose again, you’re probably much better off than the rest of us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lazarus-causes-ioudaioi-to-believe-in-jesus&#34;&gt;Lazarus causes &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; to believe in Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 12:9-11&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9 When the large crowd of the &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; learned that Jesus was there, they came, not only on account of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. 10 So the chief priests made plans to put Lazarus to death as well, 11 because on account of him, many of the &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; were going away and believing in Jesus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been said that Lazarus was first DEAD before Jesus. He was in a state where he could do nothing to help himself. He needed Jesus. Then there was a period where he was symbolically DEFEATED. Although he had been raised, he was still in his grave clothes. This is symbolic of the Christian who has been saved but can’t or won’t let go of past “stuff” holding them back. Then once he got rid of his grave clothes, he was DANGEROUS, so much so that the deep state wanted him taken out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are getting specific, note that John says it wasn’t even the entire temple establishment that wanted Lazarus gone; it was a much smaller subgroup of the chief priests. The number of conspirators against Jesus might have been MUCH more minor than we might otherwise imagine. I’m sure Lazarus had quite a story to tell, but we remember that in Luke 16:31, Jesus said that even if one comes back from the dead, many would still not be persuaded.Just a reminder, when reading the Gospel of John, when we read “the Jews,” we need to avoid automatically inferring “the bad guys.” John is very imprecise with some of his terms. The Ioudaioi in verses 9 and 11 are clearly on the side of Jesus. Here we have a POTENTIAL ambiguity. Are these Ioudaioi the everyday commonfolk Jews, or could John also say that many of the TEMPLE ESTABLISHMENT Ioudaioi came to believe in Jesus? THAT second possibility would rattle the chief priests. We don’t know, but it’s fun speculation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Now when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;2 saying to them, “Go into the village in front of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;3 If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and he will send them at once.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Now when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;2 and said to them, “Go into the village in front of you, and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;3 If anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.’”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;29 When he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;30 saying, “Go into the village in front of you, where on entering you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever yet sat. Untie it and bring it here.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;31 If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you shall say this: ‘The Lord has need of it.’”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark and Luke note “a donkey on which no one has ever sat – according to Lancaster, Animals used for many Jewish rituals had to be pure. This includes being without blemish and never being ridden or yoked. Lancaster also draws a parallel with Jesus’ tomb in which no one had previously lain.As donkeys are notorious for being wild and difficult to break, the fact that Jesus walked up, mounted, and rode without being bucked could potentially be another miracle. It might also explain why it took two disciples to fetch the animal. Unbroken donkeys are also supposedly attached to their mother.&lt;/p&gt;

Jesus didn’t only make this journey on Palm Sunday. He spent a lot of time with Lazarus, Mary, and Martha. This aerial perspective shows the route that Jesus probably took MANY mornings as He walked from Bethany to Jerusalem. In addition to beginning the Palm Sunday walk, one of the things we do when we go there is remember that Jesus also ascended from the Mount of Olives (Acts 1:9-12). We also tend to want to look up to the sky. Zechariah 14:4 says, “His feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east”…The somewhat adjacent Bethphage churches mark the typical starting point for a Palm Sunday procession. Since it’s about a 15-minute walk from Bethphage to the summit of the Mount of Olives, tours like the one I did begin at an overlook on the Mount of Olives near the Ascension church.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Did Jesus prophesy regarding the donkey?&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This donkey was photographed while running loose on the Greek Orthodox compound at Bethphage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars are conflicted about whether Jesus’ instructions represent a prophecy with a relatively quick miraculous fulfillment, a logical forecast given the attitudes towards hospitality in that day, or whether this was some pre-arranged code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster argues for a miracle by noting the amount of space the gospel writers spend on it. If it was prearranged or expected, he theorizes the evangelists probably would have merely written, “they brought Jesus a donkey.” None of the gospels mention a pre-arranged signal, yet that didn’t stop people from bringing forth that theory. It’s intriguing, but there is little evidence for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener makes an argument for the hospitality theory “the donkey’s owner probably saw it as helpful hospitality to a famous rabbi.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, as we mentioned on the previous slide, Jesus spent a lot of time in this area. It makes sense that He would know where to find a donkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, saying,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;5 “Say to the daughter of Zion, ‘Behold, your king is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.’”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;6 The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;7 They brought the donkey and the colt and put on them their cloaks, and he sat on them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street, and they untied it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;5 And some of those standing there said to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;6 And they told them what Jesus had said, and they let them go.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;7 And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it, and he sat on it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32 So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;33 And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;34 And they said, “The Lord has need of it.”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;35 And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their cloaks on the colt, they set Jesus on it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14 And Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;15 “Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your king is coming, sitting on a donkey&amp;rsquo;s colt!”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;16 His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and had been done to him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the 9th of 10 prophecies by Matthew where he writes, “this took place to fulfill…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of His ministry, Jesus did not permit anyone to speak of His kingship. His usual response was “my hour has not yet come.” Then on this day, as Chuck Missler liked to say, “He not only permitted it, he arranged it.” As Lancaster writes, “Sending for a donkey…indicated a shift in public policy. He was ready to declare to Israel that He was her long-awaited Messiah-King.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;Lancaster notes that just about every donkey reference in the Hebrew Bible prefigures Messiah: from Genesis 22 and Abraham’s near-sacrifice of Isaac to Jacob’s donkey in Genesis 32 to Moses in Exodus 4 and so on. The Talmud records, “In the same way, the latter redeemer will come, as it is stated, “Humble and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Why not on a horse?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much is made of the fact that Jesus rode in on a lowly donkey when we might expect a king to ride in on a horse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prevailing theory by many Protestant commentators is the crowd should have known by the donkey that Jesus wasn’t going to be a conquering king this time. In his SECOND coming, he arrives on a horse. Revelation 19:11-16.  They imply that because Jesus entered on a donkey he was not coming as a king but as a servant to lay His life down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is half correct and half incorrect.  They are correct that a donkey signaled that He came in peace. Those in the crowd who expected a political, conquering King should have seen the sign.  They are incorrect that the donkey signaled He was not entering as a king.  The key word is &amp;ldquo;conquering.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lizorkin-Eisenberg notes that “when a city welcomed a victor with open arms WITHOUT an exercise of power, it was expected that the victor would enter on a donkey and not on a horse.”  Lizorkin-Eyzenberg says Revelation 19 still fits this model –At that point in the future, the world is being judged, and the people do not accept Christ willingly. So He comes as a conqueror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, BOTH times, he comes as a King; once in peace on a donkey; but the second as a conqueror in judgment on a horse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare Solomon, the &amp;ldquo;son of David,&amp;rdquo; assuming his throne on a donkey in 1 Kings 1:33.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they had accepted Him when He came in peace, there would have been no need for Him to return in judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allenby observes protocol in 1917&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the British General Allenby was preparing to take control of Jerusalem after world war I, on December 11, 1917, he rode his horse up to the Jaffa Gate on the west side of the city. He abruptly dismounted and entered the city on foot. The official record is that he did so out of respect for the holy city. He realized he was the first Christian in over 700 years to control Jerusalem, a city claimed by three faith traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also made this humble entry as an intentional or unintentional contrast to the German Kaiser Wilhelm II’s very pompous entry 20 years earlier (the Kaiser had part of the wall near the Jaffa Gate removed so his entourage could fit through). There is a legend that, privately, Allenby supposedly told one of his aides something like, “only one Man is qualified to enter this city on horseback, and that is not me.” That’s cool if it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 Most of the crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;9 And the crowds that went before him and that followed him were shouting, “Hosanna to the &lt;mark&gt;Son of David&lt;/mark&gt;! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 And many spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches that they had cut from the fields.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;9 And those who went before and those who followed were shouting, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;10 Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father, &lt;mark&gt;David&lt;/mark&gt;! Hosanna in the highest!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;36 And as he rode along, they spread their cloaks on the road.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;37 As he was drawing near—already on the way down the Mount of Olives—the whole multitude of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;38 saying, “Blessed is &lt;mark&gt;the King&lt;/mark&gt; who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13 So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying out, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the &lt;mark&gt;King of Israel&lt;/mark&gt;!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Whose King?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Matthew and Mark have the crowd referencing “son of David” while John says explicitly, “King of Israel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’ve occasionally noted in our series, Dr. Lizorkin-Eyzenberg believes John’s audience is writing to non-Judean Israelites, including the Samaritans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Samaritans did not care, let alone think, that their messiah would be a son of David. John wanted his audience to know that Jesus is KING OF ALL ISRAEL!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we indulge a thought that the four Gospels in some way could represent the pattern of spreading the good news in Acts 1:8. In that case, we could say that Matthew and Mark were writing to Jerusalem and all Judea (Jews) – Jews would be interested in the Messiah being a &lt;em&gt;son of David&lt;/em&gt;. Keener notes that during the Passover, which celebrates the deliverance of Israel from the house of bondage, “hopes for the restoration of the Davidic kingdom ran high.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John was writing to Samaria (and other non-Jews who believed in Israel’s God, though not necessarily through the tribe of Judah) – they wouldn’t care about being a son of David, but to them, Messiah is &lt;em&gt;king over all Israel&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke, a Gentile convert, was writing to the ends of the earth, the extent of the Roman empire. His audience wouldn’t care about a son of David or a king of Israel but simply needs to know that &lt;em&gt;Jesus is King&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we might miss, but the crowd in Jerusalem that day certainly knew, is that they viewed Jesus as their liberator against the corrupt Temple establishment and the Roman occupiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They reenacted the events in 1st Maccabees where a different group of Jews made a similar triumphal entry into Jerusalem after the successful revolt against the Greeks and Antiochus IV in 164 BC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the crowds going before Him, and those who followed, were shouting, “Hosanna . . . .”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosannah is a Hebrew phrase Hoshia Nah that means Save us now or save us, please. Hoshia is in the same word family as Yeshua, Salvation.“Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the LORD&amp;quot; comes from Psalm 118:25-6. Psalms 113-128 are known as Hallel Psalms. Lancaster notes that in its original 1st Temple usage, Psalm 118 celebrated a Judean King’s return from battle. Ever since, Jewish tradition held that Psalm 118 would herald the messianic redemption. The Talmud mentions explicitly that the waving of palm branches accompanies the singing of the Hallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was unmistakable what the crowd was communicating.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/9211fcbc479a3a9141066042ca7345be.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;A group of people walking on a sidewalk Description automatically generated with low confidence&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a lot less crowded when Sarah and I did the Palm Sunday walk. Oddly enough, this is a busy street. Periodically we’d have to make way for a car. There was a car coming down and a car going up that had to navigate around each other at one point. That was entertaining.The man in the middle is Chuck Missler, who I frequently mention. This was in 2010, so he would have been about 75. Chuck had a tremendous impact on me and millions of others through his ministry. His unique background as a naval academy graduate and career as a secular executive before the transitioning to vocational ministry. I can’t say the transition to full-time ministry because his view is that we are ALL in the full-time ministry whether we know it or not. Chuck went to be with the Lord in 2018. Chuck taught me a love for God’s word and Israel. His arm is around my friend Peter from England and on his left is my friend Stuart from Australia. I know they have their backs to us, which breaks many rules of photography, but I still love and cherish this picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-cheapest-souvenir-in-israel&#34;&gt;The cheapest souvenir in Israel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Luke 19:39-40&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;39 And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples.”   40 He answered, “I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian commentaries typically see those self-righteous and, if I may say, “wascawy phawacees” at it again (many apologies to Elmer Fudd). If this is true, they ignored a fundamental tenet in the Art of War. Never interrupt your enemy when he is in the process of destroying himself. If I was Jesus&amp;rsquo; enemy (GOD FORBID!) I might have been inclined not to say anything and let him get in trouble with the Romans for inciting an insurrection.Keener noted at Mark 11:1 that had the Roman garrison recognized the implications the crowd was making; they probably would have arrested him. Lancaster writes, “even those Pharisees who may have hoped the acclamations were true understood the grave political danger they were in by such an open proclamation. They feared for Yeshua’s life.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; You decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either case, Jesus&amp;rsquo; reply says it all. Whereas before he said, “my time has not yet come,” He now says that creation can&amp;rsquo;t keep silent any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re probably wondering what this has to do with &amp;ldquo;the cheapest souvenir in Israel.&amp;rdquo; Unfortunately, a trip to Israel is not inexpensive. It’s been said that the best way to leave Israel with a small fortune is to enter Israel with a large fortune.But there is one free item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the stones that didn&amp;rsquo;t cry out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/IMG_1037.JPG&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m indebted to Chuck Missler for this tip. As you walk down the Palm Sunday Road, look for a rock. This has been more difficult since they paved the road a few years back, but there are still some spots where you can find them. Of course, it’s essential to make sure you aren’t disturbing anything that’s been intentionally put there, like landscaping or stones of remembrance at gravesites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you see one, pick it up. Then when you get home, and people ask you what it is, you can say, “that’s one of the stones that didn’t cry out. You know, from Luke 19:40?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they look at you puzzled, this allows you to dig into the passage where Jesus allows the people to proclaim him King, and he doesn’t stop them. Jesus here is proclaiming Himself to be the Messiah. From here, if your person is a non-believer, you can give them CS Lewis’ line about how He’s either lying, or he’s a lunatic, or if it’s neither one of those, he must be telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Part II, we will look at the remainder of the day, including Jesus weeping over Jerusalem and issuing a prophecy about the destruction of the city.  It&amp;rsquo;s a prophecy that , today, we can reach out, touch, and know it is fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Old Testament References and Allusions in Revelation 1-3</title>

&lt;script src=&#34;https://static.esvmedia.org/crossref/crossref.min.js&#34; type=&#34;text/javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There is approximately a 2:1 ratio of Old Testament allusions (404 verses in Revelation and over 800 allusions).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also several other Old and New Testament cross-references.  While John was certainly familiar with the other Gospels and perhaps some of Paul&amp;rsquo;s writings, keep in mind there was not a &amp;ldquo;New Testament&amp;rdquo; as we think of it when John received the Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chap-1-3&#34;&gt;Chap 1-3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Revelation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 1:9 I, John, your brother and fellow partaker with you in the tribulation and kingdom and patient endurance that are in Yeshua, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Yeshua.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 10:2-4; Rev 1:2; Rev 6:9; Rev 11:7; Rev 12:11,17; Rev 19:10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 1:10 I was in the Ruach on the Day of the Lord, and I heard behind me a loud voice like that of a trumpet,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 2:12, Joe 1:15, Oba 1:15, Mal 4:5-6 Rev 4:1; Rev 10:3-8; 2 Cor 12:2-3; Joel 1:15; 2:1-31; 3:14; Amos 5:18-20;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 1:11 saying, “Write what you see in a scroll, and send it to Messiah’s seven communities—to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 30:8; Jer 30:2; Hab 2:2 Col 4:15,16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 1:12 Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned, I saw seven golden menorot.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 25:37; Ex 37:23; Zec 4:2 Rev 1:13,20; Rev 2:1; Dan 7:9-14; Dan 10:5-10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 1:13 In the midst of the menorot, I saw One like a Son of Man, clothed in a robe down to His feet, with a golden belt wrapped around His chest.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 28:4, Dan 7:13; 10:5, 16 Rev 15:6; Exo 28:6-8; Exo 39:5; Lev 8:7; Isa 11:5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 1:14 His head and His hair were white like wool, white like snow, and His eyes like a flame of fire.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 7:9; 10:6; Mat 17:2 Rev 2:18; Rev 19:12;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 1:15 His feet were like polished bronze refined in a furnace, and His voice was like the roar of rushing waters.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ezek 1:7, 24; Ezek 43:2; Dan 10:6; Rev 14:2; Rev 19:6; Psa 93:4; Isa 17:13;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 1:16 In His right hand He held seven stars, and out of His mouth came forth a sharp, two-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining at full strength.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Judges 5:31; Isa 49:2; Heb 4:12 Rev 10:1; Isa 24:23; Isa 60:19,20; Mal 4:2; Acts 26:13; Gen 1:4 (dividing light); John 3:19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 1:17 When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man. But He placed His right hand on me, saying, “Do not be afraid! I am the First and the Last,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 41:4; 44:6; 48:12; Dan 8:17-18; 10:9, 10, 12, 15, 19 Rev 1:8,11; Rev 2:8; Rev 22:13; Isa 41:4; Isa 44:6; Isa 48:12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 1:18 and the One who lives. I was dead, but look—I am alive forever and ever! Moreover, I hold the keys of death and Sheol.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 1:19 Therefore write down what you have seen, what is, and what will happen after these things.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 30:8; Jer 30:2; Hab 2:2 Rev 4:1; Dan 10:14,19 (Dan 10:2-19 and Rev 1:9-19 have identical structures)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 1:20 As for the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden menorot—the seven stars are the angels of Messiah’s seven communities, and the seven menorahs are the seven communities.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Zec 4:2;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 2:2 I know all about your deeds and your toil and your patient endurance, and that you cannot bear those who are evil. You have tested those who call themselves emissaries and are not, and have found them to be liars.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Luke 18:1; 2 Cor 4:1,16; Gal 6:9; 2 Thes 3:13; Heb 12:3-5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Jer 2:2 Rev 3:14-17; Jer 2:2-5; Mat 24:12,13; Phil 1:9; Phil 3:13-16; 1 Thes 4:9,10; 2 Thes 1:3; Heb 6:10,11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 2:5 Remember then from where you have fallen. Repent and do the deeds you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your menorah from its place—unless you repent.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 2:16; Rev 3:3; Mat 21:41-43; Mat 24:48-51; Mark 12:9; Luke 12:45,46; Luke 20:16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 2:6 “Yet you have this going for you, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 2:7 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Ruach is saying to Messiah’s communities. To the one who overcomes, I will grant the right to eat from the Tree of Life, which is in the Paradise of God.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 2:9; 3:22-24; Prov 11:30; 13:12; Ezek 31:8 Luke 23:43; 2 Cor 12:4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 2:8 To the angel of Messiah’s community in Smyrna write: “Thus says the First and Last, who was dead and came to life.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 2:9 I know your tribulation and your poverty (yet you are rich), as well as the slander of those who say they are Jewish and are not, but are a synagogue of satan.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 3:9; James 1:2-3; John 8:44 (most of John 8 is Jesus&amp;rsquo; dialogue with those who say they are Jews but not acting like Jews); Leviticus 19:18; Romans 9-11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 2:10 Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, so that you may be tested, and you will have tribulation for ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 3:11; James 1:12; 1 Pet 5:4; 2 Ti 3:12; Phl 1:29 (see additional verses from Philippians in written commentary)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 2:11 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Ruach is saying to Messiah’s communities. The one who overcomes shall never be harmed by the second death.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 20:6,14; Rev 21:8; Mat 13:24-30 (second death)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 2:13 I know where you live—where satan’s throne is. Yet you continue to hold firm to My name, and you did not deny your faith in Me even in the days of Antipas, My faithful witness, who was killed among you, where satan resides.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Num 25:1-3 Rev 21:8; Rev 22:15; 1 Cor 5:1 (Chapter 5 is all about sexual immorality); 1 Cor 6:13-18; 1 Cor 7:2; Heb 13:4; Joshua 13:22; 2 Peter 2:15, 21; Read all of 2 Peter 2 and entire narrative of Balaam and Balak in Num 22-25, 31;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Rev 2:15 Likewise you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 2:6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 2:16 Repent then! If not, I will come to you soon and make war against them with the sword of My mouth.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Rev 2:17 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Ruach is saying to Messiah’s communities. To the one who overcomes I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone—and written on the stone a new name that no one knows except the one who receives it.”&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 3:3 So remember what you have received and heard—keep it, and repent. If you will not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come upon you.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Isa 22:22 Rev 5:3-5,9; Job 11:10; Job 12:14; Mat 16:19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Gen 49:3; Deut 21:17 Col 1:15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 3:15 I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. Oh, that you were either cold or hot!&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 3:17 For you say, ‘I am rich, I have made myself wealthy, and I need nothing.’ But you do not know that you are miserable and pitiable and poor and blind and naked.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:15; Gen 3:7,10,11; Exo 32:35&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 3:18 I advise you to buy from Me gold refined by fire so that you may be rich, and white clothes so that you may dress yourself and so the shame of your nakedness will not be revealed, and eye salve to anoint your eyes so that you may see.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 55:1; John 9:6-11; 1 John 2:20-27&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Rev 5:2 I also saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lev 25:23-25 Rev 5:5; Isa 29:11,12; Isa 41:22,23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 5:3 No one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 5:13; Isa 40:13,14; Isa 41:28; Rom 11:34&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 5:4 I began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 4:1; Dan 12:8,9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 5:5 Then one of the elders tells me, “Stop weeping! Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed—He is worthy to open the scroll and its seven seals.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 49:9-10; Isa 11:1,10; Hos 5:14 Rev 1:1; Rev 6:1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 5:6 And in the midst of the throne and the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, I saw a Lamb standing, as having been slain—having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 11:2; Zech 3:8-9; 4:10 Rev 4:5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 5:7 He came and took the scroll from the right hand of the One seated on the throne.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 5:1; Rev 4:2,3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 5:8 When He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense—which are the prayers of the kedoshim.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ps 111:2 Rev 8:3,4; Psa 141:2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 5:9 And they are singing a new song, saying, “You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals. For You were slain, and by Your blood You redeemed for God those from every tribe and tongue and people and nation.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ps 40:3; 98:1; 144:9;149:1; Isa 42:10; Dan 5:19 Rev 7:9; Rev 11:9; Rev 14:6; Dan 4:1; Dan 6:25; Mark 16:15,16; Col 1:23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 5:10 You have made them for our God a kingdom and kohanim, and they shall reign upon the earth.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 19:6; Isa 61:6 Rev 20:6; Dan 7:18,27&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 5:11 Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders—their number was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 7:10 Rev 19:6; Deut 33:2; Psa 68:17; Dan 7:10; Heb 12:22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 5:12 They were chanting with a loud voice, “Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 4:11; Rev 7:12; Rev 19:1; Mat 28:18; John 3:35,36; John 17:2; 2 Cor 8:9; Phil 2:9-11; 1 Tim 1:17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 5:13 And I heard every creature in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea and everything in them, responding, “To the One seated on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and power forever and ever!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 5:6,9; Rev 6:16; Rev 7:10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 5:14 And the four living creatures kept saying, “Amen!” And the elders fell down and worshiped.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 4:9-11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 6:1 Then I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder, “Come!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 6:3,5,7; Rev 4:6,7; Acts 4:20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 6:2 I looked, and behold, there was a white horse. The one riding on it had a bow, and a crown was given to him. He went out as a conqueror so he might conquer.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Zech 1:8; 6:3; Rev 11:15,18; Rev 15:2; Rev 17:14; Psa 98:1; Psa 110:2; Isa 25:8; Rom 15:18,19; 1 Cor 15:25,55-57; 2 Cor 10:3-5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 6:3 When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, “Come!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 6:1; Rev 4:7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 6:4 Then another horse came out, fiery red. The one riding on it was permitted to take peace from the earth, so that people would slaughter one another. He was given a great sword.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jer 25:29; Zech 1:8; 6:2 Psa 17:13; Isa 10:5,6; Eze 30:24,25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 6:5 When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, “Come!” And behold, I saw a black horse. The one riding on it held a balance scale in his hand.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jer 14:1, 2; Zech 6:2 Lev 26:26; la 5:10; Eze 4:10,16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 6:6 Then I heard something like a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius—but do no harm to the oil and wine!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lev 26:25-33; Ezek 4:10, 11 Rev 9:4; Psa 76:10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 6:7 When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living creature saying, “Come!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 6:1,3,5; Rev 4:7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 6:8 Behold, I saw a horse, pale greenish gray. The name of the one riding on it was Death, and Sheol was following with him. Authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill by sword and by famine and by plague and by the wild beasts of the earth.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jer 15:2-3; 24:10;29:17; Ezek 14:21; Hos 13:14; Zech 6:3 Lev 26:22-33; Jer 15:2,3; Jer 16:4,16; Jer 43:11; Eze 5:15-17; Eze 14:13-21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 6:9 When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those slaughtered for the sake of the word of God and for the witness they had.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 1:9; Rev 2:13; Rev 11:3-7; Rev 12:11-17; Rev 19:10; 2 Tim 1:8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 6:10 And they cried out with a loud voice, saying, “O Sovereign Master, holy and true, how long before You judge those who dwell on the earth and avenge our blood?”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:18; Rev 16:5-7; Rev 18:20,24; Rev 19:2; Deut 32:36-43; Judg 16:28; 1 Sam 24:12; Psa 58:10,11; Isa 61:2; Isa 63:1-6; Luke 21:22; Rom 12:19; 2 Thes 1:6-8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 6:11 Then a white robe was given to each of them, and they were told to rest a little while longer, until the number of their fellow servants was complete—their brothers and sisters who were to be killed as they had been.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:14; Rev 13:15; Rev 17:6; Mat 10:21; Mat 23:34,35; John 16:2; Heb 11:40&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 6:12 I saw when the Lamb opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake. The sun became as black as sackcloth made of goat’s hair, and the full moon became like blood.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 50:3; Joel 2:10 Isa 13:9,10; Isa 24:23; Isa 60:19,20; Eze 32:7,8; Joel 2:10,30,31; Joel 3:15; Amo 8:9; hag 2:6,7,21,22; Mat 24:29; Mat 27:45; Mark 13:24,25; Mark 15:33; Luke 23:44,45; Acts 2:19,20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 6:13 The stars of heaven fell to the earth like a fig tree drops unripe figs when shaken by a great wind.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 34:4 Isa 7:2; Isa 33:9; Dan 4:14; Nah 3:12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 6:14 The heaven ripped apart like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from their places.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 34:4; Nah 1:5 Rev 16:20; Isa 2:14-17; Jer 3:23; Jer 4:23-26; Jer 51:25; Hab 3:6,10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 6:15 Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the military commanders and the rich and the mighty and everyone—slave and free—hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Josh 10:16; Ps 48:4-6; Isa 2:10-12, 19 Josh 10:16,17; Judg 6:2; 1 Sam 13:6; Isa 2:10,19; Isa 42:22; Mic 7:17; Heb 11:38&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 6:16 And they tell the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us, and hide us from the face of the One seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hos 10:8 Rev 6:10; Rev 19:15; Psa 2:9-12; Psa 14:5; Psa 21:8-12; Psa 110:5,6; Zec 1:14,15; Mat 26:64; 2 Thes 1:7-9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 6:17 For the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ps 76:7; Jer 30:7;Nah 1:6; Zeph 1:14-18; Mal 3:2 Psa 76:7; Psa 130:3,4; Joel 2:11; Mal 3:2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:1 After this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind would blow on the earth or on the sea or against any tree.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 11:2; Jer 49:36; Ezek 7:2; 37:9; Dan 7:2; Zech 6:5 Rev 6:6; Rev 9:4; Isa 27:3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:2 Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the seal of the living God. He cried out with a loud voice to the four angels who were permitted to harm the earth and the sea,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 1:3; Rev 8:7-12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:3 saying, “Do no harm to the earth or the sea or the trees, until we have put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ezek 9:4-6 Rev 13:16; Rev 14:1; Rev 20:4; Rev 22:4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:4 Now I heard the number of those marked with the seal: 144,000 from every tribe of Bnei-Yisrael—&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 49:1-28 Eze 47:13; Eze 48:19,31; Zec 9:1; Mat 19:28; Luke 22:30; Acts 26:7; James 1:1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:5 12,000 from the tribe of Judah; 12,000 from the tribe of Reuben; 12,000 from the tribe of Gad;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Exo 1:2-4; Num 1:4-15; Num 10:14-27; Num 13:4-16; 1 Cor 2:1,2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:6 12,000 from the tribe of Asher; 12,000 from the tribe of Naphtali; 12,000 from the tribe of Manasseh;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Luke 2:36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:7 12,000 from the tribe of Simeon; 12,000 from the tribe of Levi; 12,000 from the tribe of Issachar;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 30:18; Gen 35:23; Gen 49:11; Josh 19:17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:8 12,000 from the tribe of Zebulun; 12,000 from the tribe of Joseph; 12,000 from the tribe of Benjamin.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:9 After these things I looked, and behold, a vast multitude that no one could count—from every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues—was standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lev 23:40 Lev 23:40; John 12:13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:10 and crying out with a loud voice, saying, “Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ps 3:8 Rev 4:6,9; Rev 22:3; John 1:29,36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:11 And all the angels were standing around the throne, along with the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 4:10; Rev 15:4; Rev 19:4; Rev 22:9; Psa 45:11; Psa 97:7; Mat 4:10; John 5:23; Heb 1:6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:12 saying, “Amen, blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might belong to our God forever and ever. Amen!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Neh 12:8,46; Psa 50:14; Psa 95:2; Psa 100:4; Psa 107:22; Psa 116:17; Psa 147:7; Isa 51:3; Jer 33:9,11; jon 2:9; 2 Cor 4:15; 2 Cor 9:11,12; Col 2:7; Col 3:17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:13 Then one of the elders answered, saying to me, “Who are these dressed in white robes, and where have they come from?” I said to him, “Sir, you know.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 16:8; Judg 13:6; John 7:28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:14 Then he said to me, “These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 49:11 Rev 5:9; Rev 12:11; Heb 13:12; 1 Pet 1:19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:15 For this reason, they are before the throne of God, and they serve Him day and night in His Temple. The One seated on the throne will shelter them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lev 26:11 Rev 21:3,4; Rev 22:3; Exo 29:45; 1 King 6:13; 1ch 23:25; Psa 68:16-18; Isa 4:5,6; John 1:14; 1 Cor 3:16; 2 Cor 6:16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:16 They shall never again go hungry, nor thirst anymore; the sun shall not beat down on them, nor any scorching heat.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ps 121:5-6; Isa 49:10 Rev 21:4; Psa 121:6; so 1:6; Isa 4:5,6; Isa 25:4; Isa 32:2; jon 4:8; Mat 13:6,21; Mark 4:6,17; James 1:11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:17 For the Lamb in the midst of the throne shall shepherd them and guide them to springs of living water, and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ps 23:1-2; Ezek 34:23 Rev 4:11; Rev 21:4; Isa 25:8; Isa 30:19; Isa 35:10; Isa 60:20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 8:1 Now when the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Josh 6:10 Job 4:16; Psa 37:7; Psa 62:1; Hab 2:20; Zec 2:13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 8:2 Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Josh 6:4 Rev 8:6-12; Rev 9:1,13,14; Rev 11:15; Num 10:1-10; 2ch 29:25-28; Amo 3:6-8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 8:3 Another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a golden incense burner. He was given much incense to offer up along with the prayers of all the kedoshim upon the golden altar before the throne.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ps 141:2 Rev 6:9; Rev 9:13; Exo 37:25,26; Exo 40:26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 8:4 And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the kedoshim, rose before God from the angel’s hand.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ps 141:2 Rev 8:3; Rev 15:8; Exo 30:1; Psa 141:2; Luke 1:10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 8:5 Then the angel took the incense burner and filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it to the earth; and there were clashes of thunder and rumblings and flashes of lightning and earthquakes.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ezek 10:2; 8:5,6; Ex 19:16 Rev 11:13,19; 1 King 19:11; Isa 29:6; Zec 14:5; Mat 24:7; Mat 27:52-54; Acts 4:31; Acts 16:26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 8:6 Then the seven angels holding the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 19:16 Rev 8:2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 8:7 The first trumpeted, and there was hail and fire mixed with blood, and they were thrown upon the earth. A third of the earth burned up, a third of the trees burned up, and all the green grass burned up.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 9:23-24; Josh 10:11; Ps 18:13; Isa 28:2 Rev 8:9,10,12; Rev 6:8; Rev 9:4; Isa 2:12,13; Isa 10:17,18; James 1:11; 1 Pet 1:24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 8:8 The second angel trumpeted, and something like a huge mountain ablaze with fire was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 7:17-19; 8:10; Isa 14:12 Rev 8:7; Rev 16:3-21; Exo 7:17-21; Eze 14:9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 8:9 a third of the creatures living in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Psa 48:7; Isa 2:16; Isa 23:1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 8:10 The third angel trumpeted, and a great star fell from the heavens, burning like a torch. It fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 14:12 Rev 16:4; Exo 7:20,21; Judg 15:11; 2 King 2:19-22; 2ch 32:3; Isa 12:3; ho 13:15,16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 8:11 Now the name of the star is Wormwood; and a third of the waters became wormwood, and many people died from the waters that were made bitter.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jer 9:15; 23:15 Exo 15:23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 8:12 The fourth angel trumpeted, and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were struck, so that a third of them were darkened. A third of the day would not shine, as well as a third of the night.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Josh 10:12; Isa 13:10 Exo 10:21-23; 2 Cor 4:4; 2 Thes 2:9-12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 8:13 Then I looked, and I heard an eagle crying out with a loud voice as it flew high in the sky, saying, “Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpets the three angels are about to sound!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:1,12; Rev 11:14; Eze 2:10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Revelation (TLV)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:1 Then the fifth angel trumpeted, and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to earth. The key to the bottomless pit was given to him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 14:12-14 Rev 9:2,11; Rev 17:8; Rev 20:10; Luke 8:31; Rom 10:7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:2 He opened the pit, and smoke rose from the pit like the smoke of a gigantic furnace. The sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the pit.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 19:28; Ex 19:8 Rev 8:12; Exo 10:21-23; Joel 2:2,10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:3 Then from the smoke came locusts upon the earth, and power was given to them like the scorpions have power over the earth.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 10:12-15 Rev 9:5,10,11; Deut 8:15; 1 King 12:11; Eze 2:6; Luke 10:19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:4 They were told to do no harm to the grass of the earth or any green plant or any tree, but only the people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ezek 9:4 Rev 7:3,4; Rev 14:1; Exo 12:23; Job 2:6; Eze 9:4,6; Eph 4:30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:5 And they were permitted not to kill them, but to torment them for five months—and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings a person.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:6 In those days, people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will flee from them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Job 3:21 Rev 6:16; 2 Sam 1:9; Job 3:20-22; Job 7:15,16; Isa 2:19; Jer 8:3; ho 10:8; John 4:8,9; Luke 23:30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:7 Now the appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle. On their heads were something like crowns of gold, and their faces were like human faces.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 7:4,8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:8 They had hair like women’s hair, and their teeth were like those of lions.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Joel 1:6 Psa 57:4; Joel 1:6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:9 They had chests like iron breastplates; and the noise of their wings was like the noise of many horse-drawn chariots rushing into battle.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Joel 2:5 Job 39:25; Isa 9:5; Joel 2:5-7; Nah 2:4,5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:10 They have tails like scorpions with stingers; and in their tails is their power to harm people for five months.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:3,5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:11 They have as king over them the angel of the abyss. His name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he has the name Apollyon.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Job 26:6; 28:22; 31:12; Ps 88:11; Prov 15:11; 30:27; Amos 7:11 (LXX) John 8:44&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:12 The first woe is past. Behold, two woes are still coming after these things.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:13-21; Rev 8:13; Rev 11:14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:13 The sixth angel trumpeted, and I heard a single voice from the four horns of the golden altar before God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 8:3-5; Heb 9:24; Heb 10:21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:14 It said to the sixth angel, the one holding the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 15:18; Deut 1:7; Josh 1:4 Gen 2:14; 2 Sam 8:3; Jer 51:63&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:15 So the four angels—who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year—were released to kill a third of mankind.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:18; Rev 8:7,9,11,12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:16 The number of mounted troops was two hundred million—I heard their number.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:17 Now here is how I saw the horses and those riding on them: they had breastplates that were fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow. The heads of the horses were as heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire and smoke and brimstone.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1ch 12:8; Isa 5:28,29&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:18 By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed—by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone that came out of their mouths.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:15,17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:19 For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents, having heads by which they inflict injuries.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:10; Isa 9:15; Eph 4:14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:20 But the rest of mankind, those not killed by these plagues, did not repent and turn away from the works of their hands—they would not stop worshiping demons and the idols of gold and silver and stone and wood, which cannot see or hear or walk.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Psa 115:4-8; Psa 135:15-18; Isa 40:19,20; Isa 41:7; Isa 42:17,18; Isa 44:9-20; Isa 46:5-7; Jer 10:3-5,8,9,14,15; Jer 15:19,20; Jer 51:17; Dan 5:23; Hab 2:18-20; Acts 17:29; Rom 1:21-23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 9:21 And they did not repent and turn away from their murders or their sorceries or their sexual immorality or their stealing.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:8; Rev 17:2,5; Rev 18:3; Rev 19:2; Mat 15:19; 2 Cor 12:21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 10:1 Then I saw another powerful angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud with a rainbow over his head. His face was like the sun and his feet like pillars of fire.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Eze 1:26-28 Rev 1:15; so 5:15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 10:2 He had in his hand a little scroll that was open. He set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deut 11:24 Rev 10:5,8; Psa 2:8; Psa 65:5; Pro 8:15,16; Isa 59:19; Mat 28:18; Eph 1:20-22; Phil 2:10,11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 10:3 and he cried out with a loud voice, just as a lion roars. When he cried out, the seven thunders spoke.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Joel 3:16 Rev 8:5; Rev 14:2; Rev 15:1,7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 10:4 And when the seven thunders had spoken, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said. Do not write it down!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 8:26; 12:4-9 Deut 29:29; Isa 8:16; Isa 29:11; Dan 8:26; Dan 12:4,9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 10:5 Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand toward heaven&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deut 32:40; Dan 12:7 Rev 16:17; Dan 12:7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 10:6 and swore by the One who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and what is in it, the earth and what is in it, the sea and what is in it, that there would be no more delay.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 1:1; Deut 32:40; Neh 9:6; Dan 12:7 Rev 10:6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 10:7 But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel—when he is about to trumpet—the mystery of God is completed, just as He declared to His servants the prophets.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Amos 3:7 Luke 24:44-47; Acts 3:21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 10:8 Then the voice that I heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, “Go, take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the land.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 10:4,5; Isa 30:21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 10:9 So I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little scroll. And he tells me, “Take and eat it. It will be bitter to your stomach, but sweet as honey in your mouth.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jer 15:16; Ezek 2:8-3:3 Job 23:12; Jer 15:16; Eze 2:8; Eze 3:1-3,14; Col 3:6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 10:10 So I took the little scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it. It was sweet as honey in my mouth; but when I had swallowed it, my stomach was made bitter.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Eze 2:10; Eze 3:14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 10:11 And they tell me, “You must prophesy again about many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ezek 37:4, 9 Rev 11:9; Rev 14:6; Rev 17:15; Jer 1:9,10; Jer 25:15-30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:1 Then a measuring rod like a staff was given to me, saying, “Get up and measure the Temple of God and the altar, and count those worshiping in it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ezek 40:3-4; Zech 2:1-2 Num 33:18; Eze 40:1-48; 1 Cor 3:16,17; 2 Cor 6:16; Eph 2:20-22; 1 Pet 2:5,9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:2 But do not measure the court outside the Temple—leave it out, because it has been given to the nations, and they shall trample the holy city for forty-two months.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ezek 40:17-20 Rev 11:3,11; Rev 12:6; Rev 13:5; Num 14:34; Dan 7:25; Dan 12:7,11,12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:3 And I will grant authority to My two witnesses and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, dressed in sackcloth.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 37:34; 1ch 21:16; es 4:1,2; Job 16:15; Isa 22:12; la 2:10; John 3:5-8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:4 These are the two olive trees and the two menorot that are standing before the Lord of the earth.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Zech 4:1-2, 11-14 Exo 8:22; Isa 54:5; Mic 4:13; Zec 4:14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:5 If anyone wishes to harm them, fire comes out of their mouths and consumes their enemies. If anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this way.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Num 16:35; 1 Kings 18:37; 2 Kings 1:10-12 Num 16:28-35; 2 King 1:10-12; Psa 18:8; Isa 11:4; Jer 1:10; Jer 5:14; Eze 43:3; ho 6:5; Zec 1:6; Zec 2:8; Acts 9:4,5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:6 These two have the power to shut the heavens, so that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying. And they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they wish.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 7:19-25; 8:12; 1 Kings 17:1 Eze 7:1-12; Psa 105:26-36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:7 When they have finished their testimony, the beast that rises from the abyss will make war on them, and overcome them and kill them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 7:3, 7, 8, 21 Rev 9:2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:8 And their corpses will lie in the open street of the great city that figuratively is called Sodom and Egypt—where also their Lord was crucified.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 1:9-10; 3:9; Jer 23:14; Ezek 16:49, Ezek 23:3, Ezek 23:8 Ezek 23:19, Ezek 23:27 Rev 18:24; Luke 13:33,34; Acts 9:4; Heb 6:6; Heb 13:12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:9 Some from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will look at their corpses for three and a half days, not allowing them to be placed into a grave.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ps 79:2-3 Rev 5:8; Rev 19:17,18; Psa 79:2,3; ec 6:3; Isa 33:1; Jer 7:33; Mat 7:2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:10 Those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them. They will celebrate and send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:5,6; Rev 16:10; 1 King 18:17; 1 King 21:20; 1 King 22:8,18; Jer 38:4; John 7:7; Acts 5:33; Acts 7:54-57; Acts 17:5,6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:11 But after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood up on their feet; and great fear fell on those who were watching them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ezek 37:9-10 Rev 11:13; Josh 2:9; Jer 33:9; ho 3:5; Acts 5:5,11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:12 Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here!” And they went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies watched them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Exo 14:25; 2 King 2:1,5,7; Psa 86:17; Psa 112:10; Mal 3:18; Luke 16:23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:13 At that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:7; Rev 15:4; Rev 16:9; Josh 7:19; 1 Sam 6:5; Isa 26:15,16; Jer 13:16; Mal 2:2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:14 The second woe is past. The third woe is coming soon.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 8:13; Rev 9:12; Rev 15:1; Rev 16:1-21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:15 Then the seventh angel trumpeted, and there were loud voices in heaven saying, “The kingdom of this world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Anointed One. And He shall reign forever and ever!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 15:18; Dan 2:44-45; 7:13-14, 27 Exo 15:18; Psa 110:4; Psa 146:10; Isa 9:7; Eze 37:25; Dan 2:44; Dan 7:14,18,27; Mic 4:7; Mat 6:13; Luke 1:33; Heb 1:8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:16 And the twenty-four elders seated on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshiped God,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 4:4,10; Rev 5:5-8,14; Rev 7:11; Rev 19:4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:17 saying, “We thank you, Adonai Elohei-Tzva’ot, who is and who was, because You have taken Your great power and begun to reign.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:15; Rev 19:6,11-21; Rev 20:1-3; Psa 21:13; Psa 57:11; Psa 64:9,10; Psa 98:1-3; Psa 102:13-8; Isa 51:9-11; Isa 52:10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:18 The nations were enraged, but Your wrath has come and the time for the dead to be judged—to reward Your servants, the prophets and kedoshim, and those who fear Your name, the small and the great, and to destroy the destroyers of the earth.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ps 2:1-3; 46:6; 115:13 Rev 13:10; Rev 18:6,16-24; Rev 19:19,21; Dan 7:26; Dan 8:25; Dan 11:44,45&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:19 Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened, and the Ark of His Covenant appeared in His Temple. And there were flashes of lightning and rumblings and clashes of thunder and an earthquake and heavy hail.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jer 3:16 Rev 8:7; Rev 16:21; Exo 9:18-29; Josh 10:11; Job 38:22,23; Psa 18:12; Psa 105:32; Isa 28:2; Isa 30:30; Isa 32:19; Eze 13:11; Eze 38:22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 12:1 A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 37:9-11 Rev 1:20; Rev 21:14; Isa 62:3; Zec 9:16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 12:2 She is pregnant—crying out in birth pains, in agony to give birth.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 26:17; 66:7; Micah 4:9-10 Rev 12:4; Isa 53:11; Isa 54:1; Isa 66:7,8; Mic 5:3; John 16:21; Gal 4:19,27&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 12:3 Then another sign appeared in heaven: a great fiery red dragon that had seven heads and ten horns, and seven royal crowns on his heads.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 27:1; Dan 7:7, 20, 24 Rev 13:1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 12:4 His tail sweeps away a third of the stars of heaven—it hurled them to the earth. Now the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that whenever she gave birth he might devour her child.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 8:10 Rev 12:2; Exo 1:16; Mat 2:3-16; John 8:44; 1 Pet 5:8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 12:5 And she gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with an iron rod. And her child was snatched away to God and to His throne.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ps 2:8-9; Isa 66:7 Rev 11:12; Mark 16:19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 12:6 Then the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God so they might take care of her for 1,260 days.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:2,3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 12:7 And war broke out in heaven, Michael and his angels making war against the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 10:13-21; 12:1 Rev 12:9; Psa 78:49; Mat 25:41; 2 Cor 12:7; 2 Pet 2:4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 12:8 but they were not strong enough, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Job 7:10; Job 8:18; Job 20:9; Job 27:21-23; Psa 37:10; Acts 1:25; Jude 1:6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 12:9 And the great dragon was thrown down—the ancient serpent, called the devil and satan, who deceives the whole world. He was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 3:1; Job 1:6; 2:1; Zech 3:1 Job 1:7; Job 2:2; Isa 14:12; Isa 65:25; John 14:30; John 16:11; 2 Cor 4:4; 1 Pet 5:8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 12:10 Then I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, “Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Anointed One, for the accuser of our brothers and sisters—the one who accuses them before our God day and night—has been thrown out.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Job 1:9-11; 2:4-5; Zech 3:1 Job 1:9; Job 2:5; Zec 3:1,2; Luke 22:31; Titus 2:3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 12:11 They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives even in the face of death.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 2:10,13; Rev 20:4; Luke 14:26; Acts 20:24; Acts 21:13; Heb 11:35-38&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 12:12 Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them! Woe to the earth and the sea, for the devil has come down to you with great rage, knowing that his time is short.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 10:6; Heb 10:37; 2 Pet 3:8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 12:13 Now when the dragon saw that he had been thrown to the earth, he stalked the woman who had given birth to the male child.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 12:4,5; Gen 3:15; Psa 37:12-14; John 16:33&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 12:14 But the woman was given two wings of the great eagle, so that she might fly away from the presence of the serpent into the wilderness, to the place where she is taken care of—for a time, times, and half a time.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 19:4; Deut 32:11; Isa 40:31; Dan 7:25; 12:7; Hos 2:14-15 Rev 11:2,3; Dan 7:25; Dan 12:7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 12:15 And from out of his mouth, the serpent spewed water like a river after the woman, in order to sweep her away with a flood.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hos 1:5-10 Rev 17:15; Psa 18:4; Psa 65:7; Psa 93:3,4; Isa 8:7; Isa 28:2; Isa 59:19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 12:16 But the earth came to the aid of the woman. The earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had spewed from his mouth.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Exo 12:35,36; 1 King 17:6; 2 King 8:9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 12:17 So the dragon became enraged at the woman and went off to make war with the rest of her offspring—those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Yeshua.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 3:15 Rev 12:11; Rev 1:2,9; Rev 6:9; Rev 20:4; 1 Cor 2:1; 1 John 5:10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Revelation (TLV)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 13:1 (And he stood on the shore of the sea.) Then I saw a beast rising out of the sea, that had ten horns and seven heads. On his horns were ten royal crowns, and upon his heads were slanderous names.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 7:3, 7, 8; Rev 13:5,6; Rev 17:3,5; Dan 7:25; Dan 11:36; 2 Thes 2:3,4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 13:2 Now the beast that I saw was like a leopard, his feet like a lion’s, and his mouth like a bear’s. And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 7:4-6, 8; Rev 16:10; Rev 17:12; Rev 19:20; Rev 20:2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 13:3 One of his heads seemed to have been slain, but the fatal wound was healed. The whole earth was amazed and followed the beast.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 7:8 Rev 17:6,8,13,17; Luke 2:1; John 12:19; Acts 8:10,11,13; 2 Thes 2:9-12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 13:4 And they worshiped the dragon, because he had given authority to the beast. They also worshiped the beast, chanting, “Who is like the beast, and who can make war against him?”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 15:11; Dan 8:24;  Rev 17:14; Deut 9:2; 1 Sam 17:24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 13:5 The beast was given a mouth uttering great boasts and blasphemies. It was given authority to act for forty-two months.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 14:13-15; Dan 7:8, 11; Dan 7:20-25; 11:36 Rev 13:7; Rev 11:7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 13:6 Then he opened his mouth with blasphemies against God, to slander His name and His tabernacle—that is, those dwelling in heaven.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 7:8; Rev 4:1,4; Rev 5:13; Rev 7:9; Rev 11:12; Rev 12:12; Rev 18:20; Rev 19:1-6; Heb 12:22,23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 13:7 He was also permitted to make war against the kedoshim and overcome them, and he was given authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 7:21; Rev 10:11; Rev 11:18; Rev 17:15; Exo 9:16; Isa 10:15; Isa 37:26; Jer 25:9; Jer 27:6,7; Jer 51:20-24; Dan 5:18-23; Luke 4:6; John 19:11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 13:8 All who dwell on the earth shall worship him—everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the Book of Life of the Lamb who was slain.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 12:1 Rev 17:8; Eph 1:4; Titus 1:2; 1 Pet 1:19,20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 13:9 If anyone has an ear, let him hear.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 2:7,11,17,29&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 13:10 If anyone is meant for captivity, to captivity he goes. If anyone is to be killed by the sword, by the sword he must be killed. Here is the perseverance and faith of the kedoshim.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jer 15:2; 43:11; Rev 1:9; Rev 2:2,19; Rev 3:3,10; Rev 14:12; la 3:26; Hab 2:3; Luke 18:1-8; Luke 21:19; Col 1:11; Heb 6:12; Heb 10:36,37; Heb 12:3,4; James 1:2-4; James 5:7,8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 13:11 Then I saw another beast rising out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 8:3; Job 40:15; Rev 13:17; Rev 12:3,4,17; Rev 17:6; Dan 7:8,24,25; 2 Thes 2:4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 13:12 He exercises all the authority of the first beast before him, and he makes the earth and all those who dwell in it worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 13:3,14-17; Rev 17:10,11; 2 Thes 2:4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 13:13 He performs great signs, even making fire come down from heaven in the sight of men.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 Kings 1:9-12; 1 Kings 18:38; Rev 11:5; Num 16:35; 2 King 1:10-14; Mat 16:1; Luke 9:54-56; 2 Tim 3:8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 13:14 And he deceives those who dwell on the earth through the signs he is permitted to perform, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image in honor of the beast who has the sword wound yet lived.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mark 13:21-23; Rev 14:9,11; Rev 15:2; Rev 16:2; Rev 19:20; Rev 20:4; 2 King 20:7; Eze 8:10; Eze 16:17; Dan 11:36; 2 Thes 2:4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 13:15 The second beast was permitted to give life to the image of the first beast, so that the image of the beast could even speak and cause all who would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 3:1-7; Dan 7:20,25; Rev 16:2,5; Rev 17:6,14,17; Rev 18:20,24; Rev 19:20; Rev 20:4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 13:16 He also causes all—the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slave—to receive a mark on their right hand or upon their forehead.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:3; Exo 13:9; Deut 6:8 (contrast); Deut 11:18; Eze 9:4; 2 Tim 3:8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 13:17 And so no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark—either the name of the beast or the number of his name.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 13:18; Rev 15:2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 13:18 Here is wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is a number of a man, and his number is 666.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:17; Deut 3:11; Rom 3:5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:1 Then I looked, and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion, and with Him were 144,000 who had His name and His Father’s name written on their foreheads.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Psa 2:6; Ezek 9:4 Rev 3:12; Rev 7:3; Rev 13:16,17; Luke 12:8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:2 And I heard a voice from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and the booming of loud thunder. The voice I heard was like harpists playing on their harps.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ezek 1:24; 43:2 Rev 5:8; Rev 15:2; Rev 18:22; 2 Sam 6:5; 1ch 25:1-7; Psa 33:2; Psa 43:4; Psa 57:8; Psa 92:3; Psa 98:5; Psa 147:7; Psa 149:3; Psa 150:3-6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:3 And they are singing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one is able to learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Psa 96:1-6,144:9 Rev 5:9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:4 These are the ones who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These have been redeemed from among mankind as firstfruits for God and the Lamb.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jer 2:3; Amo 6:1; 1 Cor 16:15; James 1:18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:5 And in their mouth was found no lie—they are blameless.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Son 4:7; Dan 6:4; Hos 10:2; Zeph 3:13; Mal 2:6; Luke 23:4; Eph 5:27; Col 1:22; Jude 1:24; 2 th 2:11-12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:6 And then I saw another angel flying high in the sky, having a timeless message of good news to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth—to every nation and tribe and tongue and people.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 10:11; Rev 13:7; Dan 4:1; Dan 6:25,26; Eph 3:9; Gal 1:6-9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:7 He said in a loud voice, “Fear God and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come. Worship the One who made heaven and earth and sea and springs of water.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 20:11 Rev 4:11; Exo 20:11; Neh 9:6; Psa 33:6; Psa 95:5; Psa 124:8; Psa 146:5,6; Pro 8:22-31; Jer 10:10; Acts 14:15; Acts 17:23-25 (Compare with &amp;ldquo;Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:8 Another angel, a second one, followed, saying, “Fallen, fallen, is Babylon the great—she who made all nations drink of the wine of the fury of her immorality.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 21:9; Jer 51:7-8; Gen 10:9-10; Rev 13:15-17; Rev 17:6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:9 And another angel, a third one, followed them, saying in a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jer 25:15; Rev 14:11; Rev 13:3-6,11-17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:10 he shall also drink the wine of God’s fury, poured full strength into the cup of His wrath. And he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 19:24; Ps 75:8; Isa 51:17 Psa 37:34; Psa 52:6; Psa 91:8; Eze 20:48; Mat 13:41,42,49,50; 2 Thes 1:8,9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:11 The smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever. Those who worship the beast and its image and those who receive the mark of his name have no rest day or night.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 34:10; 66:24 Deut 28:65; Isa 57:20; Mat 11:28; Mark 9:43-49; Luke 16:24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:12 Here is the perseverance of the kedoshim—those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Yeshua.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 3:8,10; 2 Tim 4:7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:13 Then I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write: How fortunate are the dead—those who die in the Lord from now on!” “Yes,” says the Ruach, “that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Psa 19:11; Psa 85:13; Mat 25:35-40; Luke 16:9; 1 Cor 15:58; Gal 6:7,8; Phil 2:17; 2 Tim 4:7,8; Heb 6:10,11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:14 Then I looked, and behold, there was a white cloud—and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man. He had a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 7:13; Joel 3:12,13; Mat 13:30; Mark 4:29&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:15 Then another angel came out of the Temple, crying out with a loud voice to the One seated on the cloud, “Put in your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is fully ripe.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 15:6; Zec 5:6-11; Mat 13:36-42, 23:32; 1 Thes 2:16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:16 So the One seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:19; Rev 16:1-21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:17 Then another angel came out of the Temple in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 15:5,6; Rev 16:1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:18 Then another angel—the one who has authority over fire—came out from the altar; and he called out with a loud voice to the one holding the sharp sickle, saying, “Put in your sickle and gather the grape clusters from the vineyard of the earth, because her grapes are ripe.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Joel 3:12-14; Jer 25:30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:19 So the angel swung his sickle over the earth and gathered the clusters from the vineyard of the earth and threw them into the great winepress of the wrath of God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 63:1-6; Rev 19:15-21; Deut 32:32,33&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:20 And the winepress was stomped on outside the city, and blood flowed from the winepress as high as a horse’s bridle for 1,600 stadia.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Joel 3:13; Isa 63:1-3; Rev 19:14-21; Isa 34:5-7; Isa 66:24; Eze 39:17-21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 15:1 Then I saw another great and wonderful sign in heaven: seven angels who have seven plagues—the last ones, for with them God’s wrath is finished.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lev 26:21 Rev 15:7; Rev 14:10,19; Rev 16:19; Rev 19:15; Dan 12:6,7,11,12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 15:2 And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had overcome the beast and his image and the number of his name standing by the sea of glass, holding the harps of God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 5:8; Rev 14:2; Rev 19:1-7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 15:3 And they are singing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb, saying, “Great and wonderful are Your deeds, Adonai Elohei-Tzva’ot! Just and true are Your ways, O King of the nations!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 15:1-18; Deut 31:30, 32:44; Psa 92:5; 111:2; 139:14 Rev 17:14; Rev 19:16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 15:4 Who shall not fear and glorify Your name, O Lord? For You alone are Holy. All the nations shall come and worship before You, for Your righteous acts have been revealed!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 15:11; Ps 86:9; Isa 66:23; Jer 10:7 Rev 16:7; Rev 19:2; Psa 97:8; Psa 105:7; Isa 26:9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 15:5 After these things I looked, and the Temple of the Tent of Witness in heaven was opened.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 38:21 Rev 11:19; Exo 25:21; Num 1:50,53; Mat 27:51&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 15:6 Out of the Temple came the seven angels having the seven plagues, dressed in pure bright linen and wearing wide gold sashes around their chests.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lev 26:21 Rev 1:13; Exo 28:5-8; Eze 44:17,18; Luke 24:4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 15:7 Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 37:16; Rev 4:9; Rev 10:6; 1 Thes 1:9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 15:8 And the Temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power. No one was able to enter the Temple until the seven angels’ seven plagues were finished.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 40:34-35; Lev 26:21; 1 Kings 8:10-11; 2 Chron 5:13-14; Isa 6:1-4 Rev 15:1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:1 Then I heard a loud voice from the Temple saying to the seven angels, “Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of God’s wrath.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Psa 75:8, 79:6; Jer 10:25; Ezek 22:31; Isa 51:17; Rev 14:9-11; Rev 15:7; 1 Sam 15:3,18; Eze 9:5-8; Eze 10:2; Mat 13:41,42; (compare bowls with 10 plagues: Exo 7-12)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:2 So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and foul and painful boils came upon the people having the mark of the beast and worshiping his image.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 9:9-11; Deut 28:35; Psa 79:1-7; Zep 3:8; Rev 13:15-18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:3 Next the second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood like that of a corpse; and every living thing in the sea died.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 7:17-25 Rev 8:9; Gen 7:22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:4 Then the third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 7:17-21; Ps 78:44 Rev 16:5; Rev 14:7; Exo 7:20; Exo 8:5; Isa 50:2; Eze 35:8; ho 13:15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:5 Then I heard the angel of the waters saying, “Righteous are You—the Holy One, who is and who was—because You have passed these judgments.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ps 145:17 Rev 1:4,8; Rev 4:8; Rev 11:17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:6 For they have poured out the blood of kedoshim and prophets, and You have given them blood to drink—they are deserving!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 49:26 Rev 11:18; Rev 18:20; Jer 26:11,16; Luke 12:48; Heb 10:29&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:7 Then I heard the altar saying, “Yes, Adonai Elohei-Tzva’ot, true and righteous are Your judgments!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ps 19:9; 145:17 Rev 13:10; Rev 14:10; Rev 19:2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:8 The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was permitted to scorch people with fire.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:16; Rev 9:17,18; Rev 14:18; Psa 19:9; Mal 4:1; Jon 4:8; Mat 13:6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:9 People were scorched with fierce heat, and they cursed the name of God—the One who has power over these plagues. But they did not repent, to give Him glory.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:13; Rev 14:7; Josh 7:19; Jer 13:6; Amo 4:6-12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:10 Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in pain&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 10:21-23 Rev 11:10; Mat 13:42,50; Mat 24:51; Luke 13:28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:11 and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their boils. But they did not repent of their deeds.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:9; 2 Tim 3:13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:12 The sixth angel poured out his bowl over the great river Euphrates; and its water was dried up, to prepare the way for the kings from the east.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 15:8; 2 Sam 8:3; Isa 11:15-16; 41:2,3, 25; 46:11; Jer 51:36; Eze 38-39; Dan 11:43-45; Rev 9:14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:13 Then I saw—coming from the dragon’s mouth and from the beast’s mouth and from the false prophet’s mouth—three unclean spirits like frogs.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 8:6 Rev 19:20; Rev 20:10; Joel 3:11; Zep 3:8, Isa 43:9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:14 For they are demonic spirits performing miraculous signs, who go out to the kings of the whole world—to gather them for battle on the great Day of Elohei Tzva’ot.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 Kings 22:21-23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:15 “Behold, I am coming like a thief! How fortunate is the one who stays alert and keeps his clothes on, lest he walk around naked and they see his shamefulness.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 3:4,18; Exo 32:25; Isa 47:3; Eze 16:37; ho 2:3; Hab 2:15; 2 Cor 5:3; 1 Th 5:4;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:16 Then the spirits gathered the kings to the place called in Hebrew Har-Megiddo.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Judges 5:19; 2 Kings 23:29-30; 2 Chron 35:22; Zech 12:11 Judg 5:19; 2 King 23:29,30; Zec 12:11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:17 The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air. A loud voice came out of the Temple from the throne, saying, “It is done!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 10:6,7; Rev 21:6; Dan 12:7-13; John 19:30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:18 And there were flashes of lightning and rumblings and clashes of thunder and a great earthquake—such as never happened since mankind has been on the earth, so mighty was the quake.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:13; Dan 12:1; Zech 14:4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:19 Then the great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations collapsed. Babylon the great was remembered before God, to force her to drink the cup of the wine of His furious wrath.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jer 25:15 Rev 14:8-10; Rev 18:5; Isa 49:26; Isa 51:17-23; Jer 25:15,16,26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:20 Every island fled away, and no mountains were to be found.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 6:14; Rev 20:11; Isa 2:14-17; Jer 4:23-25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:21 Enormous hail—about a hundred pounds each—falls from heaven on the people. And the people cursed God because of the plague of hail—so extreme was that plague.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 9:18-25 Rev 16:9,11; Isa 8:21; Job 2:9; Eze 38:22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17:1 Then one of the seven angels holding the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, “Come, I will show you the sentencing of the great prostitute, who sits on many waters.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jer 51:7,13; Nah 3:4; Isa 1:21; Rev 14:18 (Isa 13-14 and Jer 50-51 are the Babylon chapters)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17:2 The earth’s kings committed sexual immorality with her, and those who dwell on the earth got drunk with the wine of her immorality.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 23:17; Rev 14:8; Rev 18:3,9,23; Jer 51:7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17:3 So he carried me away in the Ruach into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was full of blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 7:7,24; Rev 12:3,14; Rev 13:1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17:4 The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls. She was holding a golden cup in her hand full of detestable things and the filth of her immorality,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jer 51:7; Ezek 28:13 Ezr 9:11; Lam 1:9; Eze 24:11,13; Eze 36:25; Rev 18:3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17:5 and on her forehead was written a name, a mystery: “Babylon the Great, the mother of prostitutes and the detestable things of the earth.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:9; Rev 19:2; Rev 22:4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17:6 And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the kedoshim and with the blood of the witnesses of Yeshua. When I saw her, I was totally astounded.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hab 1:13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17:7 But the angel said to me, “Why are you astonished? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17:1-6,8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17:8 The beast that you saw was, and is not, and yet is about to rise up from the abyss and head for destruction. Those who dwell on the earth—whose names have not been written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world—will be astonished when they see the beast, because he was and is not and is to come.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 32:32-33; Dan 12:1 Rev 13:1-4,11,12; (contrast Rev 1:4)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17:9 This calls for a mind having wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated. They are also seven kings—&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17:3,7,18; Rev 13:1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17:10 five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain a little while.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17:10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17:11 The beast that was and is not—he himself is the eighth, and is one of the seven, and is heading for destruction.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17:8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17:12 The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power, but receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 7:24-25 Rev 12:3; Rev 13:1; Dan 2:40-43; Dan 7:7,8,20,24; Zec 1:18-21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17:13 These kings are of one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17:17; Isa 10:5-7; Eze 38:10; Acts 4:28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17:14 They will make war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them—because He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with Him are called and chosen and faithful.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 2:10; Deut 10:17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17:15 Then he tells me, “The waters that you saw, where the prostitute is seated, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jer 51:11-14; Eze 16:37; Eze 23:35; Rev 10:11; Rev 11:9; Rev 13:7,8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17:16 The ten horns that you saw, and the beast—these will hate the prostitute. They will make her desolate and naked, and devour her flesh and burn her up with fire.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lev 21:9 Rev 18:8,16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17:17 For God has put it into their hearts to do His will, and to be of one mind, and to give their royal power to the beast until the words of God are fulfilled.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 6:11; Rev 10:7; Rev 15:1; Pro 19:21; Isa 45:17; Isa 46:10,11; Jer 27:6,7; Eze 38:16,17; Dan 12:7; John 10:35; John 12:39,40; John 19:24,28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17:18 And the woman that you saw is the great city exercising kingship over the kings of the earth.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 12:4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:1 After these things, I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his glory.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ezek 43:2 Rev 21:23; Isa 60:1-3; Eze 43:2; Luke 17:24; 2 Thes 2:8; Dan 10:6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:2 He cried out with a mighty voice, saying: “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! She has become a den for demons, a haunt for every unclean spirit and for every unclean bird and for every unclean and detestable beast.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 21:9; 34:13-15; Jer 50:30; 51:8, 51:37; Lev 11:13-19; Isa 13:19-22; Isa 14:23; Isa 21:8; Isa 34:11-15; Jer 50:39,40; Jer 51:37; Mark 5:3-5; Luke 8:27,28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:3 For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the fury of her immorality. The kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich off the power of her self-indulgence.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jer 51:7 Jer 51:34; Lam 4:5; Luke 7:25; Isa 48:20; Isa 52:11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:4 Then I heard another voice from heaven saying, “Come out of her, my people, lest you participate in her sins and receive her plagues!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 52:11; Jer 50:8-9; 51:6-8, 45; Zech 2:10-11; Psa 50:18; Mat 23:30; 1 Tim 5:22; 2 John 1:11; 2 Cor 6:16; Luke 21:20-22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:5 For her sins have piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jer 41:9 Rev 16:19; On counting sin: Genesis 15:16 and 2 Kings 22:11-20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:6 Pay her back just as she has paid out, and give her back double for her deeds! In the cup she has mixed—mix a double dose for her!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ps 137:1-9; Jer 50:15, 29; Oba 1:15; Rev 14:10; Rev 16:19; Rev 17:2,4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:7 As she has exalted herself and indulged herself in luxury, so give her the same measure of torment and grief! For in her heart she says, ‘I sit as a queen—I am no widow; I shall never see grief.’&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 47:7-8; Zeph 2:15 Isa 47:7,8; Lam 1:1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:8 For this reason her plagues will arrive in a single day—death and grief and famine—and she shall be burned down with fire. For mighty is Adonai Elohim who judges her!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 47:9; Jer 50:31-32 Rev 11:17; Job 9:19; Psa 62:11; Isa 27:1; Jer 50:31,34; 1 Cor 10:22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:9 Then the kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality and indulged in luxury with her shall weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning—&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jer 50:46 Rev 18:18; Rev 14:11; Rev 19:3; Gen 19:28; Deut 29:23; Isa 13:19; Isa 30:33; Isa 34:9,10; Jer 50:40&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:10 standing far off because of the terror of her torment, saying: “Alas, alas, O great city—O Babylon, the mighty city! For in a single hour your judgment has come!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 13:1 Rev 18:8,17,19; Jer 51:8,9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:11 And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her, because no one buys their merchandise anymore—&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Pro 3:14; Mat 22:5; John 2:16; 2 Pet 2:3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:12 shipments of gold, silver, precious stones, and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk, and scarlet; all kinds of citron wood; all kinds of ivory products; all kinds of products made of costly wood, bronze, iron, and marble;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ezek 27:12-25 1 King 10:11; 2ch 2:8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:13 cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, and frankincense; wine, oil, fine flour, and wheat; cattle, sheep, horses, and chariots; and slaves—that is, human souls.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2 Pet 2:3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:14 The fruit of your soul’s desire has gone from you, and all the expensive and beautiful things are lost to you—never again will people find them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Luke 12:20; Luke 16:25; Eze 26:17-18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:15 The merchants of these things, who became rich from her, shall stand far off for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:11; Judg 18:23,24; Eze 27:31; Amo 5:16,17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:16 saying, “Alas, alas, O great city—clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:10,11; Rev 17:4; Luke 16:19-31&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:17 For in a single hour so much wealth has been ruined!” And every ship captain and passenger, sailors and all who make their living at sea, stood at a distance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:11; Isa 23:14; Eze 27:27-36; jon 1:6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:18 and were crying out, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, ‘What city is like the great city?’&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:10; Rev 13:4; Isa 23:8,9; Jer 51:37; Eze 27:30-32&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:19 And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, weeping and mourning, “Alas, alas, O great city—in her all who had ships at sea grew rich from her wealth! For in a single hour has she been ruined!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:20 Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you kedoshim, emissaries and prophets! For God has judged her condemnation of you!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jer 51:48 Rev 6:10; Rev 19:2; Deut 32:42; Psa 18:47; Psa 94:1; Isa 26:21; Luke 11:49,50; Luke 18:7,8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:21 Then a mighty angel picked up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying: “So shall Babylon, the great city, be thrown down with violence, never to be found again!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jer 51:63-64 Rev 18:22; Rev 12:8; Rev 16:20; Rev 20:11; Job 20:8; Psa 37:36; Eze 26:21; Dan 11:19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:22 And the sound of harpists and musicians, flautists and trumpeters, shall never be heard in you again! And the craftsman of any craft shall never be found in you again! And the sound of a mill shall never be heard in you again!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 13:20; Jer 25:10; Ezek 26:13 Isa 24:8,9; Jer 7:34; Jer 16:9; Jer 25:10; Jer 33:11; Eze 26:13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:23 And the light of a lamp shall never shine in you again! And the voice of the bridegroom and bride shall never be heard in you again! For your businessmen were the tycoons of the world, for all the nations were deceived by your sorcery!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jer 7:34; 16:9; 25:10; Nah 3:4; Luke 17:26-29; Rev 12:9; Rev 13:13-16; Rev 17:2,5; Rev 21:8; Rev 22:15; 2 King 9:22; Isa 47:9; Nah 3:4; Acts 8:11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:24 And in her was found the blood of the prophets and kedoshim and all those slaughtered on the earth.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jer 51:49; Rev 6:10, 16:6, 17:6, 19:2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:1 After these things, I heard something like the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, shouting: “Halleluyah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 4:10,11; Rev 5:9-13; Rev 7:10-12; Rev 11:15; Rev 12:10; 1ch 29:11; Psa 3:8; jon 2:9; Mat 6:13; 1 Tim 1:16,17; Ps 104:35&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:2 For His judgments are true and just. For He has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her whoring, and has avenged the blood of His servants caused by her hand.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deut 32:43; Ps 119:137; Jer 51:48 Rev 6:10; Rev 18:20,24; Deut 32:35,43; Psa 19:9; Num 35:19; Rom 12:19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:3 And a second time they shouted, “Halleluyah! The smoke from her goes up forever and ever!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 34:9-10; Jer 51:48 Rev 14:11; Rev 18:9,18; Gen 19:28; Isa 34:10; Jude 1:7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:4 Then the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who is seated on the throne, saying, “Amen! Halleluyah!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:1; Psa 106:48; Psa 115:12-13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:5 Then a voice came from the throne, saying: “Praise our God, all you His servants and all who fear Him, both the small and the great!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ps 22:23; 134:1; 135:1 Rev 11:18; Rev 20:12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:6 Then I heard something like the voice of a great multitude—like the roar of rushing waters or like the rumbling of powerful thunder—saying, “Halleluyah! For Adonai Elohei-Tzva’ot reigns!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ps 93:1; 97:1; Ezek 1:24; 43:2; Dan 10:6 Rev 11:15-18; Rev 12:10; Rev 21:22; Psa 47:2,7; Psa 93:1; Psa 97:1,12; Psa 99:1; Isa 52:7; Mat 6:13; Ex 15:18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:7 Let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him! For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and His bride has made herself ready,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 52:1; Isa 25:6-9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:8 She was given fine linen to wear, bright and clean! For the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the kedoshim.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:13,14; Psa 132:9; (contrast Rev 17:4); Lev 16:4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:9 Then the angel tells me, “Write: How fortunate are those who have been invited to the wedding banquet of the Lamb!” He also tells me, “These are the true words of God.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:11; Rev 21:5; Rev 22:6; 1 Tim 1:15; 1 Tim 4:9; 2 Tim 2:11; Titus 3:8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:10 Then I fell down at his feet and worshiped him. But he said to me, “See that you do not do that—for I am only a fellow servant with you and your brothers and sisters who hold to the testimony of Yeshua. Worship God! For the testimony of Yeshua is the Spirit of Prophesy.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Luke 24:25-27,44; John 5:39; Acts 3:12-18; Acts 10:43; Acts 13:27; Rom 3:21,22; 1 Pet 1:10-12; 2 Pet 1:19-21; Col 2:18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:11 Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The One riding on it is called Faithful and True, and He judges and makes war in righteousness.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ps 18:10; 45:3-4; Isa 11:4-5; Ezek 1:1 Rev 15:3-7; Psa 45:3-7; Psa 50:6; Psa 72:2-4; Psa 96:13; Psa 98:9; Psa 99:4; Isa 11:3-5; Isa 32:1; Isa 45:21; Isa 63:1-5; Jer 23:5,6; Jer 33:15; Zec 9:9,10; Heb 7:1,2; Jer 42:5; Titus 2:13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:12 His eyes are like a flame of fire, and many royal crowns are on His head. He has a name written that no one knows except Himself.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:16; Rev 2:17; Rev 3:12; Gen 32:29; Exo 23:21; Judg 13:18; Isa 9:6; Mat 11:27; Luke 10:22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:13 He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and the name by which He is called is “the Word of God.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 63:3; John 1:1,14; 1 John 1:1; 1 John 5:7; Rev 5:6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:14 And the armies of heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, were following Him on white horses.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:8; Rev 4:4; Rev 7:9; Mat 28:3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:15 From His mouth comes a sharp sword—so that with it He may strike down the nations—and He shall rule them with an iron rod, and He treads the winepress of the furious wrath of Elohei-Tzva’ot.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ps 2:8-9; Isa 11:4; 63:3-6 Rev 14:17-20; Isa 63:2-6; Isa 49:2; Hosea 6:5; Isaiah 11:4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:16 On His robe and on His thigh He has a name written, “King of kings, and Lord of lords.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deut 10:17 Rev 17:14; Psa 72:11; Pro 8:15,16; Dan 2:47; Phil 2:9-11; 1 Tim 6:15; 1 Sam 24:4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:17 Then I saw a single angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he cried out to all the birds flying high in the sky, “Come, gather for the great banquet of God—&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 34:6-7; Ezek 39:17 Rev 19:21; Isa 56:9; Jer 12:9; Eze 39:17-20; Gen 15:11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:18 to eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of generals and the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and those riding on them, the flesh of all men, both free and slave, both small and great!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 34:6-7; Ezek 39:18 Rev 6:15; Rev 13:16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:19 Also I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against the One who sat on the horse and against His army.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ps 2:2; Joel 3:9-11 Rev 19:11-14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:20 Then the beast was captured, and along with him the false prophet who had performed the signs before him by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast, as well as those who had worshiped his image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 30:33; Dan 7:11 Rev 14:10; Rev 21:8; Gen 19:24; Deut 29:23; Job 18:15; Psa 11:6; Isa 30:33; Isa 34:9; Eze 38:22; Mt 25:41&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:21 The rest were killed with the sword coming out of the mouth of the One riding on the horse. And all the birds gorged themselves with their flesh.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ezek 39:19-20 Rev 19:17,18; Rev 17:16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 20:1 Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key to the abyss and a great chain.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2 Pet 2:4; Jude 1:6; Rev 9:1-3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 20:2 He seized the dragon—the ancient serpent, who is the devil and satan—and bound him for a thousand years.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 3:1, 13-14; Isa 24:21-22 Rev 9:11; Rev 12:9,13,15,17; Rev 13:2,4; Job 1:7; Job 2:1,2; 1 Pet 5:8; 2 Pet 2:4; Jude 1:6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 20:3 He also threw him into the abyss and locked and sealed it over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were completed. After these things, he must be released for a short while.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 20:7-10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 20:4 Then I saw thrones, and people sat upon them—those to whom authority to judge was given. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony for Yeshua and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or his image, nor had they received his mark on their forehead or on their hand. And they came to life and reigned with the Messiah for a thousand years.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 7:9, 22, 27, 12:2 Rev 5:9; Rev 11:11,15; Dan 2:44; Dan 7:18,27; Mat 19:28; Rom 8:17; Rom 11:15; 1 Cor 6:2; 2 Tim 2:12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 20:5 The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 26:14 Rev 11:11,15; Eze 37:2-14; Rom 11:15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 20:6 How fortunate and holy is the one who has a share in the first resurrection! Over such the second death has no authority, but they shall be kohanim of God and the Messiah, and they shall reign with Him for a thousand years.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 19:6; Isa 26:19 Rev 20:4; Rev 1:6; Rev 5:10; Rom 8:17; 2 Tim 2:12; Rev 1:6; Rev 22:7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 20:7 When the thousand years has ended, satan shall be released from his prison,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 20:2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 20:8 and he shall come out to deceive the nations at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for the battle. Their number is like the sand of the sea.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Psa 2:1; Ezek 7:2, 38:2-3; 39:1, 6 Judg 7:12; 1 Sam 13:5; 1 King 4:20; Isa 10:22; Jer 33:22; Heb 11:12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 20:9 And they came up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the kedoshim and the beloved city—but fire fell from heaven and consumed them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deut 23:14; 2 Kings 1:9-12; Psa 87:2;  Ezek 38:22; 39:6 Rev 11:5; Rev 13:13; Gen 19:24; Exo 9:23,24; Lev 10:2,3; Num 11:1; Num 16:35; 2 King 1:10-15; Psa 97:3; Psa 106:18; Isa 30:33; Isa 37:36; Eze 38:22; Eze 39:6; Luke 9:54; Luke 17:29; 2 Thes 1:8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 20:10 And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are too, and they shall be tortured day and night forever and ever.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 14:10; Mat 25:41,46&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 20:11 Then I saw a great white throne, and the One seated on it. The earth and heaven fled from His presence, but no place was found for them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 2:35 Rev 12:8; Job 9:6; Romans 2:16; Romans 14:10; 2 Cor 5:10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 20:12 And I saw the dead—the great and the small—standing before the throne. The books were opened, and another book was opened—the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to what was written in the books, according to their deeds.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 18:20-23; Ex 32:32-33; Ps 62:12; 69:28; Dan 7:10 Rev 20:13; Rev 2:23; Rev 22:12; Psa 28:4; Psa 62:12; Pro 24:12,29; Ecc 12:14; Jer 17:10; Jer 32:19; Mal 3:18; Mat 16:27; Luke 10:26-28; John 5:27-29; Rom 2:6; 2 Cor 5:10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 20:13 The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Sheol gave up the dead in them. Then they were each judged, each one of them, according to their deeds.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mt 25:46; Hos 13:14; Rev 20:12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 20:14 Then death and Sheol were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death—the lake of fire.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 25:8; Rev 20:6; Rev 21:8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 20:15 And if anyone was not found written in the Book of Life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ex 32:32-33; Dan 12:1 Rev 19:20; Mat 25:41; Mark 9:43-48&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 65:17; 66:22 Rev 13:1; Isa 27:1; Isa 57:20; Dan 7:3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:2 I also saw the holy city—the New Jerusalem—coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:7,8; Psa 45:9-14; Isa 54:5; Isa 61:10; Isa 62:4; John 3:29; 2 Cor 11:2; Eph 5:25-27,30-32&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:3 I also heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, “Behold, the dwelling of God is among men, and He shall tabernacle among them. They shall be His people, and God Himself shall be among them and be their God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lev 26:11-12; Ezek 37:27 Zec 8:8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:4 He shall wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more. Nor shall there be mourning or crying or pain any longer, for the former things have passed away.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 25:8; 35:10; 51:11; 65:19 Rev 21:1; Psa 144:4; Mat 24:35; 1 Cor 7:31; 2 Cor 6:17; 2 Pet 3:10; 1 John 2:17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:5 And the One seated upon the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new!” Then He said, “Write, for these words are trustworthy and true.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:6 Then He said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will freely give from the spring of the water of life.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hos 14:4; Rom 3:24; Rom 8:32; 1 Cor 2:12; 1 Cor 3:5,12,21; 1 John 5:4,5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:7 The one who overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:3; Zec 8:8; Rom 8:15-17; Heb 8:10; 1 John 3:1-3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:8 But for the cowardly and faithless and detestable and murderers and sexually immoral and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars—their lot is in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 20:14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:9 Then came one of the seven angels holding the seven bowls full of the seven final plagues, and he spoke with me, saying, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lev 26:21 Rev 21:2; Rev 19:7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:10 Then he carried me away in the Ruach to a great and high mountain, and he showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ezek 40:2 Rev 21:2; Eze 40:1-49; Eze 48:15-22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:11 having the glory of God—her radiance like a most precious stone, like a jasper, sparkling like crystal.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 60:1-2; Ezek 43:2 Rev 21:18; Rev 4:6; Rev 22:1; Job 28:17; Eze 1:22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:12 She had a great, high wall, with twelve gates, and above the gates twelve angels. On the gates were inscribed the names of the twelve tribes of Bnei-Yisrael—&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:4-8; Num 2:2-32; Acts 26:7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:13 three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Eze 48:31-34&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve emissaries of the Lamb.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18:20; Mat 10:2-4; Mat 16:18; 1 Cor 3:10,11; Gal 2:9; Eph 2:20; Eph 3:5; Eph 4:11; Jude 1:17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:15 The angel speaking with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city and its gates and walls.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ezek 40:3, 5 Rev 11:1,2; Exo 40:3-5; Eze 41:1-5; Zec 2:1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:16 The city is laid out as a square—its length the same as its width. He measured the city with the rod—12,000 stadia. Its length and width and height are equal.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Eze 48:8-19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:17 He also measured its wall—144 cubits by human measurement, which is also an angel’s measurement.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 7:4; Rev 14:3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:18 The material of the city’s wall was jasper, while the city was pure gold, clear as glass.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:11,21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:19 The foundations of the city wall were decorated with every kind of precious stone—the first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Exo 28:17-21; Exo 29:10-14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:20 the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, carnelian; the seventh, yellow topaz; the eighth; beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls—each of the gates was from a single pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, transparent as glass.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:11,18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:22 I saw no temple in her, for its Temple is Adonai Elohei-Tzva’ot and the Lamb.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;John 2:19-21; John 10:30; Col 1:19; Col 2:9; Heb 9:1-12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:23 And the city has no need for the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God lights it up, and its lamp is the Lamb.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 60:19-20 Luke 2:32; John 1:4,9,14,18; John 5:23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:24 The nations shall walk by its light, and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 60:3-5, 16 Psa 72:10,11; Isa 60:3-10,13; Isa 66:11,12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:25 Its gates shall never be shut by day, for there shall be no night there!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 60:11; Zech 14:7 Rev 22:5; Isa 60:20; Zec 14:7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:26 And they shall bring into it the glory and honor of the nations.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 60:5, 16 Rev 21:24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:27 And nothing unholy shall ever enter it, nor anyone doing what is detestable or false, but only those written in the Book of Life.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 52:1; Ezek 44:9; Zech 14:21 Rev 3:5; Rev 13:8; Rev 20:12,15; Phil 4:3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:1 Then the angel showed me a river of the water of life—bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ps 46:4; Ezek 47:1; Zech 14:8 Rev 3:21; Rev 4:5; Rev 5:6,13; Rev 7:10,11,17; John 14:16-18; John 15:26; John 16:7-15; Acts 1:4,5; Acts 2:33&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:2 down the middle of the city’s street. On either side of the river was a tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 2:9; 3:22-24; Ezek 47:12 Rev 21:24; Psa 147:3; Isa 6:10; Isa 57:18,19; Jer 17:14; Eze 47:8-11; ho 14:4; Mal 4:2; Luke 4:18; 1 Pet 2:24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:3 No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in the city, and His servants shall serve Him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 3:17-19; Zech 14:11 Rev 7:15; John 12:26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:4 They shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ps 17:15; Ezek 9:4 Rev 3:12; Rev 14:1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:5 Night shall be no more, and people will have no need for lamplight or sunlight—for Adonai Elohim will shine on them. And they shall reign forever and ever!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 60:19; Dan 7:18, 22, 27; Zech 14:7 Rev 3:21; Rev 11:15; Dan 7:18,27; Mat 25:34,46; Rom 5:17; 2 Tim 2:12; 1 Pet 1:3,4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:6 He said to me, “These words are trustworthy and true! Adonai, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent His angel to show His servants what must happen soon.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:7; Gen 41:32; 1 Cor 7:29; 2 Pet 3:8,9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:7 Behold, I am coming soon! How fortunate is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:9; Rev 1:3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:8 I, John, am the one hearing and seeing these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel showing me these things.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:10,19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:9 But he tells me, “See that you do not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers the prophets and those keeping the words of this book. Worship God!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 4:10; Rev 9:20; Rev 14:7; Rev 15:4; Exo 34:14; 2 King 17:36; Psa 45:11; Mat 4:9; Luke 4:7; John 4:22,23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:10 Then he tells me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dan 8:26; 12:4, 9 Rev 1:3; Isa 13:6; Eze 12:23; Rom 13:12; 2 Thes 2:3; 1 Pet 4:7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:11 Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy, and the righteous still do righteousness, and the holy still be holy.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ezek 3:27; Dan 12:10 Rev 22:3; Rev 7:13-15; Job 17:9; Pro 4:18; Mat 5:6; Eph 5:27; Col 1:22; Jude 1:24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:12 Behold, I am coming soon, and My reward is with Me, to pay back each one according to his deeds.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:13 “I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 44:6 Rev 1:8,11; Rev 21:6; Isa 41:4; Isa 44:6; Isa 48:12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:14 How fortunate are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the Tree of Life and may enter through the gates into the city.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 2:9; 3:22-24; Prov 11:30 Rev 21:27; John 10:7,9; John 14:6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:15 Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the sexually immoral and the murderers and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deut 23:18 Rev 21:8,27; 1 King 22:8,21-23; Isa 9:15,16; Jer 5:31; John 3:18-21; John 8:46; 2 Thes 2:10-12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:16 I, Yeshua, have sent My angel to testify these things to you for My communities. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 2:28; Num 24:17; Mat 2:2,7-10; Luke 1:78; 2 Pet 1:19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:17 The Ruach and the bride say, “Come!” And let the one who hears say, “Come!” Let the one who is thirsty come—let the one who wishes freely take the water of life!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rom 3:24; 1 Cor 2:12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:18 I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book. If anyone adds to them, God shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deut 4:2; 12:32 Rev 14:10,11; Rev 15:1; Rev 16:1; Rev 19:20; Rev 20:10,15; Lev 26:18,24,25,28,37&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:19 and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his share in the Tree of Life and the Holy City, which are written in this book.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deut 29:19-20 Rev 22:12; Rev 1:3; Rev 2:7,11,17,26; Rev 3:4,5,12,21; Rev 7:9-17; Rev 14:13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:20 The One giving testimony to these things says, “Yes! I am coming soon!” Amen! Come, Lord Yeshua!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 1:18; so 8:14; Isa 25:9; John 21:25; 2 Tim 4:8; Heb 9:28; 2 Pet 3:12-14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, the name for &amp;ldquo;Genesis&amp;rdquo; (Hebrew בְּרֵאשִׁית) means &amp;ldquo;in the beginning.&amp;rdquo; Below is a partial list of things that had their beginning in Genesis but have their end, fulfillment, or completion in Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Topic&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Genesis&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Revelation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Earth Created&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 1:1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Earth Passed away&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sun, moon, stars&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 1:14-16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 6:12; Rev 8:12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Earth’s government&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 37&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Earth’s judgment&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 16:8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sun to govern Day&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 1:16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No need of sun&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Darkness called night&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 1:5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No night there&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Waters He called seas&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 1:10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No more sea&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A river for earth’s blessing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 2:10-14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A river for New Earth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:1-2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Man in God’s Image&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 1:26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Man Headed by Satan’s Image&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Entrance of sin&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;End of sin&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21, Rev 22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Curse pronounced&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 3:14-17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No more curse&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Death entered&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 3:19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No more death&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 21:4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Cherubim first mentioned&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 3:24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Cherubim final mention&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19:4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Man driven out of Eden&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 3:24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Man restored&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tree of life guarded&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 3:24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Access to Tree of life&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sorrow &amp;amp; suffering enter&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 3:17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No more sorrow&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22:4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Religion, art, and science separated from God&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Religion, art, and science judged, destroyed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Nimrod founds Babylon&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 10:8-10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Babylon falls&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 17, Rev 18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;God’s Flood to Destroy evil generation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 6-9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Satan’s flood to Destroy elect generation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A bow: God’s promise&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 9:13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A bow for remembrance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 4:3, Rev 10:1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sodom &amp;amp; Egypt: Corruption, judgement&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 13, 19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“Sodom &amp;amp; Egypt”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 11:8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A confederation vs. Abraham’s people&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A confederation vs. Abraham’s Seed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A bride for Abraham’s son&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A bride for Abraham’s Seed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Marriage of First Adam&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 2:18-23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Marriage of Last Adam&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Promised Seed Possess gate of enemies&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Promised Seed possessing Earth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Man’s dominion ceased and Satan’s begun&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gen 3:24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Satan’s domain ended and man’s restored&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rev 22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

      <title>#2 Wilderness and Negev - 1/12/23</title>
      <link>https://talmidimway.com/sites/2023-blog/honor/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://talmidimway.com/sites/2023-blog/honor/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dead Sea Devotional&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was another full day of activities centered around the Dead Sea and Judean wilderness.  The general theme of the day was honor.    We started with a walk along the strand of the Dead Sea as the sun was rising over the &lt;strong&gt;Moab&lt;/strong&gt; mountains.  Ronan  talked about the honor and faithfulness of Ruth the Moabitiess.  In the photo below, the Moab mountains are visible through the haze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.875in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Masada&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then drove to  &lt;strong&gt;Masada&lt;/strong&gt; . Masada means &amp;ldquo;fortress&amp;rdquo; in Hebrew.  It was a palace/fortress Herod built for himself that ended up being used by Jewish rebels.  After the Temple was burned in AD 70, the last 1000 holdouts fled here and made it their last stand.  It holds the same symbolism as the Alamo does in Texas history.  As the Romans were about to storm the top of the fortress, Josephus records that 10 men were tasked with killing their friend&amp;rsquo;s and family and burning/destroying anything of value.  This was a better outcome in their view than being subject to Roman punishment.  Finally the last man standing fell on his sword and when the Romans scaled the wall.  We toured the historic site and learned a lot about 1st century life. As we exited, we walked down a path that parallels the Roman siege ramp, where the Romans breached the walls to find no booty to plunder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the drive from Masada, we learned about the geographic and geologic distinctions among the three words that get translated into English as &amp;ldquo;desert&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;wilderness.&amp;rdquo;  Bmidbar, which is also the name of the book of Numbers in the Hebrew Bible is relatively fertile with shade and water available.  The next type, Tsiya, has no food or shelter.  What happened was villages sprang up about a day&amp;rsquo;s journey apart.  The third type is Yeshimon.  In this type there truly is nothing for days.  Grumbling while in a Tsiyo or Yehimon would be more understandible, but the Israelites grumbled in the Bmidbar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kfar Hanokdim&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then traveled to a location called &lt;strong&gt;Kfar Hanokdim,&lt;/strong&gt; which is a recreated Bedouin village and it is great example of Jews and Arabs working together.  A Jewish man wanted to preserve the hospitality culture that he believed his people have lost (and how much more have WE lost it in the west?), so he approached a group of Arab bedouins who were still living that lifestyle about creating a living museum.   My roommate Jeremy was selected to get 10 sheep from point A to point B about 50 feet away.  It was virtually impossible.  The lessons are certainly there for folks in leadership, but also it was a reminder that we are the stubborn sheep prone to wandering from our Shepherd. We did get to ride camels also. My camel is pictured below.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how to interpret his facial expession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:8.66667in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set up the main discussion on Abraham and Hospitality in Genesis 18-19.  I recorded a brief video devo here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gPqCrqMDyXM&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tel Arad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of time constraints, we were not able to get to Tel Arad, which was a location I had really wanted to see.  One thing about traveling here is &amp;ldquo;blessed are the flexible.&amp;rdquo;  In the bus, we received a fantastic teaching on the history and application of Arad.  It was a place that had a nearly identical replica of the Jerusalem temple.  The first problem is what&amp;rsquo;s another temple doing outside of Jerusalem and what are Jews doing worshipping there?  It gets worse.  On one pillar there was a dedication inscribed &amp;ldquo;to YHWH and his Asherah.&amp;rdquo;   Asherah is a pagan fertility goddess.  So we&amp;rsquo;re forced to ask &amp;ldquo;what in the world was going on here?&amp;rdquo;  After we&amp;rsquo;re done pointing fingers at those dishonoring God, we can&amp;rsquo;t forget to look in the mirror.  What are things we are worshipping alongside of God and bringing dishonor to Him?  What stories do our purchases,  video streaming queues, and internet histories tell?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dead Sea Float&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended the day with a dip in the &lt;strong&gt;Dead Sea&lt;/strong&gt; - The salinity is about 10x that in oceans, which makes it impossible to sink.  The mineral content means the water is also poisonous to drink. Many claim healing properties from the water and mud from the lake&amp;rsquo;s floor, so it&amp;rsquo;s a tradition to &amp;ldquo;mud up&amp;rdquo; before a dip.  This reminded me of a contrast to living water versus deadly water.  Again, back to our bank accounts and netflix queues: might we actually be ingesting poison water by the things we take in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a brief video of me covered in mud talking about living water!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vb6lfETOmWY&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it was a day filled with great lessons and an exponentially deeper understanding of God&amp;rsquo;s word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s route from Google Maps (starting and ending at the Dead Sea public beach).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Sunday mornings, we are leading a verse-by-verse study through the book of Genesis.  Every lesson will have a video that focuses on the cultural, historical, and geographic background of the passage followed by a live teaching. &lt;strong&gt;New content is produced every week.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a completed verse-by-verse study through the book of Revelation conducted February - September 2022.  Each lesson included a video that focuses on the cultural, historical, and geographic background of the passage followed by a live teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Seven Letters have a number of different layers of application.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;#&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Elements&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Notes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Name of the Church&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The underlying meaning of the town&amp;rsquo;s name is also significant&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Attribute of Jesus&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ties back to Revelation 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Commendation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This is omitted for Sardis and Laodicea&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Concern&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This is omitted for Smyrna and Philadelphia&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Exhortation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Usually, what the believers are to do in response to the concern&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Promise to the Overcomer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;CJB: &amp;ldquo;wins the victory&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;ldquo;Those who have ears, let them hear&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elements six and seven are inverted starting with Thyatira.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will include a summary in the main commentary sections as we discuss each city&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;ecclesia&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;each-letter-has-a-pauline-epistle-counterpart&#34;&gt;Each Letter has a Pauline Epistle Counterpart&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know Paul also wrote seven letters to seven messianic communities?  He wrote 13 letters, three of which were written to pastors and three of them have two letters.  If we exclude those written to pastors and combine those who received two letters, we are left with (wait for it&amp;hellip;) seven!  According to Missler, thematically, Paul&amp;rsquo;s seven letters roughly (though not always perfectly) correspond with Jesus&amp;rsquo; seven letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;#&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Revelation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Paul&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Notes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ephesus&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ephesians&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;First love/devotion not just doctrine&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Smyrna&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Philipians&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Joy through suffering/endure persecution&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Pergamos&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Corinthians&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The carnal church / married to the world / need to be pure&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Thyatria&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Galatians&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A call out of religiousity/paganism&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sardis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Romans&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Devotion to Orthodoxy but must be with love&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Thessalonians&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hope in second coming/missionary outreach&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Laodicea&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Colossians&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Only a few miles apart, instructed to trade with each other, and there are Greek phrases that only occur in the New Testament in these two letters/ prosperous compromise&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;each-letter-has-a-matthew-13-counterpart&#34;&gt;Each Letter has a Matthew 13 Counterpart&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Missler, thematically, Jesus&amp;rsquo; seven parables of the Kingdom roughly (though not always perfectly) correspond with Jesus&amp;rsquo; seven letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;#&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Revelation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Matthew 13&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Notes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ephesus&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sower/Four Soils&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tested those could be similar to the first three soils&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Smyrna&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tares/Wheat&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Adversary/enemy has infiltrated&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Pergamos&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mustard Seed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;We assume the mustard &amp;ldquo;tree&amp;rdquo; is bad (though this is debated). Generally, mustard plants only grow to a few feet tall - one in which the birds of the air (also typically evil) could lodge would mean it&amp;rsquo;s become a monstrosity. Pergamos became married to the world and followed the way of Balaam. They followed their flesh instead of God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Thyatria&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Woman &amp;amp; Leaven&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Assuming the leaven is also used negatively in Matthew 13 (as leaven usually represents sin in the Old Testament), Jezebel contaminates the community just like the woman with leaven introduces sin into the batch&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sardis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Treasure in Field&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The treasure is hidden.  Most don&amp;rsquo;t see it.  A few found worthy will be clothed in white&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Pearl of Great Price&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Persevere through trials (a pearl grows in response to an introduce irritation;); sold out for Jesus&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Laodicea&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dragnet&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The judgment.  Separation of Good and Bad (good are kept, bad are cast away/vomitted out)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;layers-of-interpretation&#34;&gt;Layers of Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars have pointed out at least five different layers of interpretation/application of the Seven Letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;#&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Application&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Notes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Immediate, first century context, real fellowships with real struggles&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Admonitory to all fellowships&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The things the seven fellowships struggled with are the same things all fellowships struggle with (but not to say that these are the ONLY things fellowships struggle with)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Personal - he who as an ear&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The things the seven fellowships struggled with are the same things you and I struggle with (though not exclusively)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Reflexive - did the fellowships see themselves the way Jesus saw them?  Do we see ourselves the way He sees us?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;History of the Gentile Church &lt;em&gt;in order&lt;/em&gt;, from the Apostolic Church (Ephesus) in the first century, to the Apostate Church (Laodicea) today&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;See discussion below.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;seven-letters-as-prophecy-of-the-gentile-church&#34;&gt;Seven letters as prophecy of the Gentile church&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the Seven Letters as a prophetic history of the gentile church is an interesting theory, though proponents must admit they are entirely speculating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;rsquo;t prove it from Scripture nor can we believe this interpretation would have remotely entered the minds of the original recipients.  Also, it is potentially myopic as it entirely ignores the history of the &lt;em&gt;Eastern&lt;/em&gt; church, including Russian/Greek/Armenian Orthodox, Arab Christian, Coptic, African and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll present it here since the theory is very widely accepted, especially among Protestant commentators (all of whom naturally see themselves as being in &amp;ldquo;Philadelphia&amp;rdquo; not &amp;ldquo;Laodicea&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who hold the belief that the seven letters spell out the history of the Gentile church would see the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;#&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Revelation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Age&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Notes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ephesus&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Apostolic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;From Resurrection through late 1st century or the time of the Jewish/Gentile split in the 2nd century&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Smyrna&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Persecuted&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jewish and Roman persecutions - late 1st/early 2nd through early 4th century&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Pergamos&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Constantine/Byzantine&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The church became the state religion (&amp;ldquo;married to the world&amp;rdquo;) in a way that Jesus never intended for it to be&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Thyatria&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Catholic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Medieval period, at the lastest, dated to &amp;ldquo;great schism&amp;rdquo; of 1054 or earliest, to St. Benedict in 530, who is considered the father of the European monasticism.  The church became mixed with extra-biblical traditions, &amp;ldquo;queen of heaven&amp;rdquo; etc.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sardis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Reformation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16th century.  You have a &amp;ldquo;name&amp;rdquo; (denomination) that you are alive, but are dead&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Missionary/evangelical&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;18th century&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Laodicea&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Comfortable/apostate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;late 20th century&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
