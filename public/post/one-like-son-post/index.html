      <p>Revelation Backgrounds lesson 4 is titled, &ldquo;One Like a Son of Man&rdquo; based on John&rsquo;s description of the divine being he sees.  Note that he does not say this is Jesus speaking directly.  In fact, we know from verses 1:1 and 22:8 that it is NOT Jesus speaking to John but an Angel.  Nonetheless, the depiction is assuredly that of Jesus Messiah in His glorified state.</p>
<p>For our background, we will read Daniel chapters 7 and 10 along with Revelation 1 and note the consistency of idioms used throughout the Bible, Old and New Testaments, specifically the descriptions of the &ldquo;one like a Son of Man&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Ancient of Days&rdquo;.  For this reason, we like to say that our Bible is 66 separate books, but one integrated message.</p>
<img src="images/f37a1158a991a6a4d9acb4a8284cc1ff.jpeg" caption="Temple Menorah" width="25%" style="float:right"/>
<p>We ended last lesson with John hearing a great voice behind him.  Now here in verse 12, we see John turning to look and he sees the gold seven branched Menorah.  This menorah probably looked much like the one in the picture. Next we learn that the one like a Son of Man was in the midst of the Menorah and later we will see that each branch, each light, is one of the seven congregations  A Menorah is one object with seven branches, which draws images of John 15. Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the vine, you are the branches.&rdquo;  We are supposed to be the vessels through which God&rsquo;s light shines.  Jesus also said in John 15 &ldquo;abide in Me.&rdquo;  We must remain connected to the source.  A Menorah is a great picture of Jesus.</p>
<p>Next we have a description of the person John saw, which is nearly identical to Daniel&rsquo;s visions. This description bears some resemblance to the High Priest carrying out his duties in the Tabernacle.  One commentator said, &ldquo;The garments are highly symbolic, showing that Jesus is the heavenly priest, fully prepared and qualified to carry out His duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In verse 19, we will look at this Greek phrase <mark>μετα ταυτα</mark> (meta tauta), which is often translated as &ldquo;after these things.&rdquo;  The phrase appears exactly ten times in Revelation and acts as a signpost to let us know where we are.  In what is called gematria, certain numbers that reappear throughout the Bible appear to be associated with specific themes.  We&rsquo;ve talked previously how the number seven indicates perfection or completeness.  All this means is that scholars have looked at where seven (or groups/multiples of seven) appear and they have noticed the theme of completeness.  Along these lines, 10 indicates divine order.  The most obvious examples are the Ten Commandments and the Ten plagues.  There were also ten generations from Adam to Noah, then the Flood came.  Meta Tauta will signify an additional stage of God setting things in order.</p>
<p>The lesson will conclude with a side-by-side comparison of Revelation 1 and Daniel 10.  This demonstrates that our 66 books we call the Bible is ONE integrated message and it consistent from Genesis to Revelation.  There was no &ldquo;plan B,&rdquo; where God decided the Old Testament was irrelevant (God forbid!). Jesus Himself says this.  Not until all things have been fulfilled will one jot or tittle pass away from the Torah (Mat 5:18).</p>
