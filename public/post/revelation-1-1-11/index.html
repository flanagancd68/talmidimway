      <p>This third lesson is titled, &ldquo;Greetings&rdquo; because John includes an introduction and salutation very much in the style of correspondence of that day.</p>
<ul>
<li>John will give us the sequence of the delivery:
<ul>
<li>From God to Yeshua/Jesus, from Yeshua to an angel, from an angel to John, and from John to Yeshua&rsquo;s servants.
<ul>
<li>Jesus had to learn of this from the Father.</li>
<li>It is important to note that <em>it is the ANGEL who is speaking to John</em>.</li>
<li>What makes this challenging is that the angel speaks of members of the Godhead in the 1st person.
<ul>
<li>In the Old Testament, we often see &ldquo;the Angel of the LORD&rdquo; also speaking of God the Father in the 1st person.</li>
<li>I have often assumed that the Angel of the LORD was a pre-incarnate appearance of Jesus.  We call this a &ldquo;theophany.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Now after studying the context of chapter 1, it may not be that simple.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The immediate recipients were His servants at the seven churches in Asia.
<ul>
<li>As we work through the book, begin to notice when things are out of place and how God sets things in their proper order.</li>
<li>These Jewish congregations are outside of the land of Israel
<ul>
<li>The promise made by God to their ancestors was to inherit the Land.</li>
<li>By the end of Revelation, God will set this right and they will be back inside the Land.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then the document would have spread to all believers at the end of the first century.</li>
<li>Then, indirectly, Revelation is written for all believers since, including you and me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/greek_letter_101ce.jpg" alt="" width="30%" style="float:right"/>
<ul>
<li>
<p>John frequently uses the terms &ldquo;testimony,&rdquo; and &ldquo;witness.&rdquo;  The picture to the right is a Dead Sea Scroll fragment (4Q175) called <em>Testimonia</em> (“Messianic Anthology”), 1st century BC.</p>
<ul>
<li>He employs courtroom terminology in all his writings.</li>
<li>In the Gospel of John, he is providing evidence that Jesus is the promised Messiah for all Israel in addition to evidence that the corrupt Jerusalem Temple establishment is usurping their power.</li>
<li>In Revelation, he testifies that not only is Jesus the coming king, this time it&rsquo;s not just the corrupt Temple establishment but the corrupt world system that is on trial.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revelation is unique because it is the only book in the Bible that promises a blessing for those who read, hear and obey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In chapter 1 we see the first of several patterns of seven.</p>
<ul>
<li>The commentary section of <em>talmidimway.org</em> will list many of these.
<ul>
<li>For example &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; (v.1) and &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; (v.7) each occur exactly seven times throughout the book.</li>
<li>There are seven &ldquo;blessings&rdquo;, beginning with v.3.</li>
<li>The description of Jesus in vs. 5-6 has seven attributes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the lesson, we will also unpack what John may have meant by, &ldquo;I was in the Spirit on the Day of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>
