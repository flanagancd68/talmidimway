<td>Lev 19:2 “Speak to all the congregation of the people of Israel and say to them, You shall be holy, <strong>for I the LORD your God am holy</strong>.  <br>Isa 47:4 Our Redeemer—the LORD of hosts is his name— is the <strong>Holy One of Israel</strong>. <br><strong>Joh 14:6</strong> Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and <strong>the truth</strong>, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.  <br>1 Jn 5:20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may <strong>know him who is true</strong>; and we are <strong>in him who is true</strong>, in his Son Jesus Christ**. He is the true God and eternal life**.  <br>Isa 22:20-22 In that day I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, (21) and I will clothe him with your robe, and will bind your sash on him, and will commit your authority to his hand. And he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. (22) And I will place on his shoulder the <strong>key of the house of David</strong>. He shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open. <br>Luk 1:31-35 And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. (32) He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the <strong>throne of his father David,</strong> (33) and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom, there will be no end.” And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be since I am a virgin?” (35) And the angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called <strong>holy</strong>—the Son of God. <br>Mat 16:19 I will give you the <strong>keys of the kingdom of heaven</strong>, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”   <br>Act 15:15-18 And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written, (16) “‘After this, I will return, and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen; I will rebuild its ruins, and I will restore it, (17) that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles who are called by my name, says the Lord, who makes these things (18) known from of old.’ (Quoting Amos 9:11-12 and referencing Isaiah 16:5)</td>

(8) He will swallow up death forever; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from all faces, and the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for the LORD has spoken. <br>Joh 10:7-9 So Jesus again said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. (8) All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. (9) I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. <br>1 Cor 16:8-9 But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, (9) for a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many adversaries. <br>2 Cor 2:12 When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, even though a door was opened for me in the Lord,   <br>Col 4:3 At the same time, pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ, on account of which I am in prison—   <br>2 Cor 12:10 For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.   <br>Joh 14:21 Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.”</td>

(23) By myself I have sworn; from my mouth has gone out in righteousness a word that shall not return: ‘To me, every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear allegiance.’ (24) “Only in the LORD, it shall be said of me, are righteousness and strength; to him shall come and be ashamed all who were incensed against him. (25) In the LORD all the offspring of Israel shall be justified and shall glory.”  <br>Est 8:17 And in every province and in every city, wherever the king&rsquo;s command and his edict reached, there was gladness and joy among the Jews, a feast and a holiday. And many from the peoples of the country declared themselves Jews, for fear of the Jews had fallen on them.   <br>Psa 72:10-11 May the kings of Tarshish and of the coastlands render him tribute; may the kings of Sheba and Seba bring gifts! (11) May all kings fall down before him, all nations serve him! <br>Php 2:10-11 so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, (11) and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</td>
