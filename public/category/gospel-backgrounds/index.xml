      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In THE LOGOS We see the revelation of the Apostle John, a first-century Galilean Jew, of the Word becoming flesh. To understand his words, we need to understand them from a first-century Galilean Jewish perspective. Jesus brings the revelation and glory of God into the world of men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospels are Jewish documents. 1st Century “Christianity” was a Jewish sect.
John is often viewed as contrasting the correct way of Christianity with the incorrect way of Judaism, but this represents what is called an anachronistic fallacy, often shortened to “Anachronism” - misappropriation of concepts and ideas in time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often see anachronisms in period piece movies.  Someone will be wearing a digital watch in a movie set in the 18th century.  at the 1955 enchantment under the sea dance, Marty McFly is playing a 1958 gibson guitar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a challenge to restrain our own presuppositions, our set of established beliefs, when we read the Bible.  It is natural to assume a biblical speaker to affirm our presuppositions in order to justify our positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overarching anachronistic fallacy Many commentators commit is to take what is called “the parting of the ways” between Judaism and Christianity that occurred much later (2nd-4th centuries CE) and reading it back into this text in the 1st century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, since it had not occurred yet, there is absolutely no way John or any other biblical writer could have the split between Judaism and Christianity in view when they were writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called eisegesis - reading into the text.  Modern conservative scholars would all agree that eisegesis is bad yet many of them do it almost automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we strive for is EXEGESIS, understanding the text IN CONTEXT to extract what the author was saying.  To do this, we must first realize the gospels are Jewish documents written within a historical context of 2nd Temple Judaism.  The audience were Jewish Christ followers together with many non-Jews who had joined a Jewish sect..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early church fathers affirmed John’s authorship of this Gospel strongly and unanimously. Some of the fathers claim to have personally known those who knew John in Ephesus in his later years, thus making a direct link to the tradition of Johannine authorship. The evangelist John is shown here with the symbol of an eagle, the one of the four living creatures which is traditionally associated with him (Ezekiel 1:5-10 and Revelation 4:6-7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-11&#34;&gt;John 1:1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logos in the normal sense means “word or speech”.  In this prologue, John uses it in the mystical sense.  He alludes directly to the beginning of the Torah and the beginning of creation.  He starts this with an intentional allusion to Genesis 1:1 “In the beginning”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-12-6&#34;&gt;John 1:2-6&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. 6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall the first act of Creation. “and God said Let there be Light, and there was light.”&lt;br&gt;
In verse 4  John declares that this life had always been available through God’s word, which is the same word that he identifies with Jesus (IVP).
In John 1:5, The divine light from the first day of creation shines once again into the dark world of man, signifying a new creation (COM)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John
Excavations in the early 2000s revealed this cave west of Jerusalem near Ein Kerem. Archaeologist Shimon Gibson identified it with the ministry of John the Baptist on the basis of a stick-figure drawing of a man inside the cave. Gibson’s theory was published in The Cave of John the Baptist (Doubleday, 2004).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For responses, see that by James F. Strange (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/reviews/the-cave-of-john-the-baptist/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/reviews/the-cave-of-john-the-baptist/&lt;/a&gt;) and Todd Bolen (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bibleplaces.com/cave-of-john-the-baptist/%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://www.bibleplaces.com/cave-of-john-the-baptist/)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the writing of the church father Origen (AD 185-254), the location of John’s baptizing at Bethany beyond the Jordan has been located at a point near the river opposite Jericho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-17&#34;&gt;John 1:7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;7  He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some scholars note that John has a “legal” feel.  As you read John&amp;rsquo;s gospel, be on the lookout for the terms Witness, Testimony, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, John is interested not only in establishing Jesus’ credentials, he is also interested in “convicting” the corrupt Jerusalem establishment on the grounds of usurption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/01-the_logos_files/01.Picture7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;30%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discovered in Cave 4 of Qumran in the early 1950s, this text contains five biblical verses that focused on the coming of the Messiah. This artifact was photographed in the Amman Museum.&lt;br&gt;
A few scholars suspect John may have been part of the Essene sect, but in any case he was definitely influenced by them.  The Essenes believed that the forces controlling Jerusalem and the Temple were usurpers and priests of darkness.  They juxtaposed darkness and light just as John does throughout his writings.   “in the Dead Sea Scrolls, the forces of light and darkness were engaged in mortal combat, but light was predestined to triumph” (IVP)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-18-13&#34;&gt;John 1:8-13&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;8 He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light. 9 The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. 11 He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. 12 But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, 13 who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is spiritual rebirth, not ethnic descent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerusalem was the home of David and place where his greater Son was appointed to rule over the nation.  John uses a term Ioudaioi, which get’s translated as “jews” but many scholars believe this is too generic.  Think of the term “Americans” -The Americans won the Gold medal in 1980 (a group of 20 hockey players).  The Americans invaded Normandy (those members of the Army and the Navy in June 1944).  The Americans imposed Tariffs on China (specifically referring to the Government).  The Americans pay their taxes on April 15 (most Americans but not all - children don’t pay taxes).  The Americans are guaranteed freedoms under the Constitution (all Americans)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the term &amp;ldquo;Jews&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot; could be anywhere from All Jews - which we know is not in view here because the 1st Century church was nearly 100% Jewish.   Unfortunately many commentators, view it as exactly this: John is an early Christian Anti-Jewish document.  It is more likely that what is in view is not rejection by all-Israel, but rather rejection by a sub-group within Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What might some of these sub-groups be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could maybe refer those in Judea who generally rejected as opposed to those in Galilee where Jesus was largely accepted. But even here, not all Judeans rejected him.  Nicodemus for example.  Several scholars believe Ioudaoi specifically refers to the ruling establishment, which for the most part wanted Jesus out of the picture.  Again Nicodemus is an exception and there were probably others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many commentaries place the blame on all Israel, which could be painting with too broad of a brush.  It would be like holding all 300 million Americans responsible for something done by a small group of corrupt politicians in Washington DC.  With that said, a national guilt might also be in view- America is a sinful and unrepentant nation, even though many Americans do repent of their sin.  Deuteronomy 9:23 states, “You rebelled against the command of the LORD your God; you neither believed Him nor listened to His voice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, we must allow God to own the business of judgment.   it is wrong to use our holy book to specifically condemn a group of people (as the church as done to Jews for the last 2000 years).  We are to love our neighbors and pray for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish thought of the day was that to be a true Child of God, one had to be a Child of Abraham, either through birth or conversion (even today, Ben Avraham is a common name a gentile takes when converting to Judaism).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John is setting the stage that it is not ethnic affiliation but spiritual rebirth that matters.  A topic that will be developed in John Chapter 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-114-15&#34;&gt;John 1:14-15&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;14  And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. 15  (John bore witness about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A father’s only son” would remind readers of Genesis 22, where God instructed Abraham “take your son, your only son whom you love, Isaac&amp;hellip;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/01-the_logos_files/01.Picture8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:left&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The star in the Church of Nativity in Bethlehem marks the spot where tradition says that Mary gave birth to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the Greek mind, the invisible spiritual real is far superior to the earthly realm.  However, God created man spirit and flesh.  Our flesh only became corrupt AFTER the fall.  God intended there to be a union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verb translated above as “dwelt” (skenoo) is related to the Greek word for “tabernacle” (skene). Just as God dwelt with his people in the tabernacle, so the Word tabernacled with his people in the incarnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-11618&#34;&gt;John 1:16:18&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;16 For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. 17 For (as) the (Torah) was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 18 No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father&amp;rsquo;s side, he has made him known.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 17 is often translated “for the law came through Moses &lt;em&gt;BUT&lt;/em&gt; Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “BUT” is a mistranslation (possibly intentional) - it is not in the Greek.  John just got through saying that Jesus was there in the beginning.  This means Grace and Truth where there in the beginning.  The Law has a special role to play for the nation of Israel but it is not in any way antithetical to the Gospel of Jesus.  John sees Jesus as affirming the covenant promises God made in the Torah.  A better reading might be “for AS the Torah was given through Moses, Grace and Truth came through Jesus Christ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “but” originally occurred in the King James Version.  The anachronistic error here involves the 16th Century division between Protestants and Catholics regarding the function of the law in the life of the believer.  One of the Reformation cries was “Faith alone”.  It wasn’t until Luther that “Law” and “Grace” became opposites.  Superimposing this view on the Biblical Text is simply not correct.  The oppose of Law is lawlessness.  The oppose of grace is disgrace.  It is wrong to view any part of the Bible as lawless or disgraceful!  God’s Law is a good and beautiful thing.  Read Psalm 119!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;study-questions&#34;&gt;Study Questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can anachronisms and eisegesis be a problem in my studies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways does John 1:1-5 parallel Genesis 1 and how does that change my thinking of Genesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I think “His own” in verse 11 refers to all Jews?  Why or why not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did my opinionAs I reflect on the “tabernacle” discussion in John 1:14, how does (or how should) this affect my walk with Jesus?
change after this lesson?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did my understanding of the Law/Old Testament change after studying 1:17?  How can I apply this going forward?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Annunciations - Luke 1:1-80</title>

&lt;p&gt;In ANNUNCIATIONS, we visit the Holy Temple in Jerusalem to watch the priesthood conduct the morning sacrifice. We meet Zechariah and follow him into the Sanctuary for his encounter with the angel Gabriel. The story of Zechariah and Elizabeth and their struggle to conceive a child hearkens back to the patriarchs. The miraculous conception of John sets in motion a chain of events that will culminate in the messianic redemption. Then, six months later, the angel descends to appear before a simple Jewish girl in a rural Galilean village. Mary leaves Nazareth and travels to Ein Karem near Jerusalem to visit her cousin Elizabeth. The Holy Spirit stirs hearts and moves tongues to give utterance to the good news of redemption.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things that have been accomplished among us,just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word have delivered them to us, it seemed good to me also, having followed all things closely for some time past, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, that you may have certainty concerning the things you have been taught.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all one sentence in Greek as it is in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is considered some of the highest academic/classical Greek in all of antiquity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this introduction belies the letter&amp;rsquo;s importance to whoever Theophilus was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This style will change abruptly in verse 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/image1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Ephesus Luke&amp;#39;s tomb with bull tb010501537&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the Gospel writers is associated with one of the Four Living Creatures in Ezekiel 1 and Revelation 4 (Lion, Man, Ox, and Eagle)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are also the standards for the camp of Israel (Numbers 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, the assignment of each has not remained constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw John as the Eagle in the last lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally Luke was associated with an Ox; today Mark gets the Ox because Mark portrays Jesus as the Servant of all, while Luke gets the Man because his gospel portrays Jesus as the Son of Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo is of Luke&amp;rsquo;s tomb in Ephesus and, you can see the Ox or Bull underneath the cross&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most scholars pin the date of the book to the 80s or early 90s CE; however, the fact that Luke (and all of the Gospels) omit mention of the destruction of the Jewish Temple in 70 CE might suggest an earlier date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who was Theophilus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theo means God and Phileo means friendship love, so the name could mean &amp;ldquo;Lover of God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potentially it is a code name. People who followed the God of Israel (including Yeshua following Jews and Gentiles) weren&amp;rsquo;t especially popular in the second-half of the first-century. Revelation speaks in code to avoid Roman censors; it&amp;rsquo;s possible the letter is addressed to the &amp;ldquo;Lover of God&amp;rdquo; who would have been known in Luke&amp;rsquo;s circle but not widely known elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is typically thought that Luke&amp;rsquo;s gospel was commissioned to provide an authoritative Greek gospel for the growing number of believers in the Gentile world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster notes that Josephus, a Jewish but pro-Roman historian, mentions (and archeology confirms) a high-priest by the name of Theophilus in the Apostolic Era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler believes Theophilus was a wealthy benefactor in one of Paul&amp;rsquo;s congregations who commissioned Luke and Acts for Paul&amp;rsquo;s trial in Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be similar to a deposition or affidavit used in courts today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early date and formal first sentence would be consistent with such a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke notes that his gospel is not the only gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a trial lawyer, he reviewed other documents and interviewed witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke, who was a physician, was highly educated and credible; therefore, he could attest to the document&amp;rsquo;s authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke makes the point that his is an &amp;ldquo;orderly account.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many commentators take this to mean Luke&amp;rsquo;s is the most chronologically accurate of the four gospels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zechariah-and-elizaeth&#34;&gt;Zechariah and Elizaeth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abijah. And he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. And they were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord. But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:6 And he believed the LORD, and he counted it to him as righteousness.  &lt;p&gt; Genesis 17:17 Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed and said to himself, &amp;ldquo;Shall a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the style abruptly changes from the lofty Greek to a Hebraic, Old Testament-style narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the many themes in the Bible is that of the righteous but barren woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish sages wrote, &amp;ldquo;whenever it is written, &amp;lsquo;she had no child,&amp;rsquo; it means she would eventually bear one&amp;rdquo; (Genesis Rabbah 38:14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, being barren was thought of as a type of curse; but here, Luke is going out of his way to let us know they were both righteous before God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He even points out that Elizabeth was from the daughters of Aaron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something a normal reader would likely pass over, but for those who dig, there is a nugget here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Levite like Zechariah was free to marry from any tribe, but it was considered especially righteous to marry another Levite from Aaron&amp;rsquo;s line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Luke (or more specifically the Holy Spirit) underscoring how righteous Zechariah was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The childless was not a punishment for sin or because he was unworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that culture, Zechariah was also free to marry another who could have children; but he didn&amp;rsquo;t. He stayed with Elizabeth as they both advanced in years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any attempt to understand the political situation in Israel during the time of Jesus is going to be limited without a study of Herod the Great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Schlegel notes that Hollywood should make a movie because his life had all the elements Hollywood likes: war, violence, romance, sex, intrigue, assassinations, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one since Solomon controlled as much land in the region, and no one has since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His footprints are all over the Holy Land in terms of his many building projects, which the people liked because they give a sense of pride, and more immediately provided numerous jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These include the great palaces at Caesarea (labeled Strato&amp;rsquo;s Tower on this map), Jericho, Herodium by Bethlehem, and Masada, which has an incredible story as the last holdout for a band of rebels against Rome in AD72.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His most famous building was probably the Jewish Temple, which was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the old city walls are from the 16th century, the Western wall still contains a part of the Herodian wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, he was one of the most ruthless dictators who ever lived, so ultimately he was hated by the people he ruled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly suffering from some form of paranoia mixed with megalomania, he didn&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to eliminate anyone he saw as a threat including immediate family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a quip that it was safer to be a pig in Herod&amp;rsquo;s house than one of his sons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He killed his wife Mariamne and then later wailed because of her death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he was dying, he gave an order to have some very popular Jewish leaders and rabbis arrested and executed&amp;hellip;all because he insisted that there be mourning on the day he died. Fortunately, that order was not carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was in the midst of this darkness that God became directly involved in Man&amp;rsquo;s affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;8 Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty, according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense. And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1Ch 24:3,10 With the help of Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, David organized them according to the appointed duties in their service&amp;hellip;the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Negev and the WildernessTabernacle ModelTabernacle model incense altar, tb052208365.jpg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were as many as 18000 Levites who could serve as priests. This was likely a once-in-a-lifetime experience for Zechariah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His job was to kindle the incense and get it lit. The Jewish Mishnah records the day-to-day functions and service of the Temple. The photo is of the altar of incense as it may have looked like in the Tabernacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Zechariah was doing this inside the Holy Place, the people were gathered. In their view, Zechariah was lifting their prayers up to God inside as they were praying outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Daniel 6, we see Daniel kept the appointed times of prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did this even though at the time, Jerusalem was in ruins. He still opened his window and prayed towards Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zechariah was likely praying too when he was interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lukes-seven-oracles&#34;&gt;Luke&amp;rsquo;s Seven Oracles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annunciation of John to Zechariah - 1:13-17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annunciation of Jesus to Mary - 1:30:37&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blessings of Elizabeth - 1:42-45&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Magnificat&lt;/em&gt; - 1:46-55&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Benedictus&lt;/em&gt; - 1:68-80&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nunc Dimitis&lt;/em&gt; 2:29:32&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary&amp;rsquo;s Sword - 2:34-25&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 1-2 continues the conspicuous pattern of sevens in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most obvious is Revelation, where we have seven churches, seven bowls, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less obvious are the seven &amp;ldquo;I AM the &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; statements by Jesus in John&amp;rsquo;s gospel and the seven Kingdom parables in Matthew&amp;rsquo;s gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we exclude duplicates and letters written to pastors, we find that Paul also wrote to seven churches (Rome, Corinth, Galatia, Ephesus, Philippi, Colossae, and Thessaloniki).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep your eyes open for these as you study the Bible. Missler calls them &amp;ldquo;fingerprints of the Holy Spirit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every verse in these oracles (also called &amp;ldquo;canticles&amp;rdquo; in some church traditions) has at least one allusion to an Old Testament verse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not have two books, a superior New Testament that replaces an inferior Old Testament. We have a single collection of 66 books that are intricately woven and interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;But the angel said to him, &amp;ldquo;Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. &lt;p&gt; And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth, for he will be great before the Lord. And he must not drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother&amp;rsquo;s womb. And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God, and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Gen 21:6-7 And Sarah said, &amp;ldquo;God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh over me.&amp;rdquo; [7] And she said, &amp;ldquo;Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.&amp;rdquo; &lt;p&gt; Num 6:2-3 &amp;ldquo;Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When either a man or a woman makes a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself to the LORD, [3] he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink. He shall drink no vinegar made from wine or strong drink and shall not drink any juice of grapes or eat grapes, fresh or dried.&lt;p&gt; Jdg 13:7 but he said to me, &amp;lsquo;Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. So then drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; &lt;p&gt;   Mal 4:5-6 &amp;ldquo;Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes. [6] And he will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the land with a decree of utter destruction.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This annunciation echos the heavenly birth announcements found in Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many will rejoice &amp;ndash; not just the immediate circumstance at the news of Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s delivery, but also those who repent and follow Jesus because of John&amp;rsquo;s message will celebrate John&amp;rsquo;s birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No strong drink &amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called a Nazirite vow from Numbers 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul underwent a temporary Nazirite vow in Acts 18 (well after his Damascus Road experience, by the way. He REMAINED Jewish after his so-called &amp;ldquo;conversion.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judges 13:7 states that when a child is to be a Nazirite from birth, there are restrictions placed on the mother as well. Elizabeth observed the Nazirite constraints. The passage references Samson, the most famous (and flawed) Nazirite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-118-20-zechariah-doubts&#34;&gt;Luke 1:18-20 Zechariah Doubts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And Zechariah said to the angel, &amp;ldquo;How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.&amp;rdquo; And the angel answered him, &amp;ldquo;I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The punishment for Zechariah&amp;rsquo;s disbelief seems harsh given that Abraham, Gideon, and even Mary asked similar questions when they received supernatural visions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, his being unable to speak was the sign from Gabriel. Be careful what you wish for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabriel comes from gibor, strong, mighty, warrior, hero, and El, the short name of God. So Gabriel is &amp;ldquo;hero of God,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;mighty man of God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible mentions two angels by name (besides The Angel of the Lord, which is a manifestation of God himself (and by extension Jesus preincarnate, since Jesus is God)), Michael and Gabriel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish and Catholic tradition adds a few more, notably Raphael and Uriel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting speculation is that Zechariah was inside praying for a son, yet when that prayer was answered, he didn&amp;rsquo;t believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This contrasts with Abraham, Gideon, and Mary where the appearance was unsolicited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, he was doubting God&amp;rsquo;s ability to answer his prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How often are we like this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-121-23&#34;&gt;Luke 1:21-23&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in the temple. And when he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he kept making signs to them and remained mute. And when his time of service was ended, he went to his home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Zechariah was inside, another priest outside the holy place ascended the ramp and sacrificed a lamb, and placed it onto the altar fires for the morning offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The priest who lit the incense was to emerge, and raise his hands in the sign of the priesthood (the &amp;ldquo;Spock&amp;rdquo; Vulcan hand gesture, which Lenord Neimoy, an observant Jew, intentionally incorporated into the original Star Trek). He then would give the priestly benediction: &amp;ldquo;the LORD Bless you and keep you; the LORD lift up his countenance on you and grant you shalom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve got two immediate problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incense priest usually emerged immediately &amp;ndash; did Zechariah&amp;rsquo;s delay mean that the people&amp;rsquo;s prayers were not heard?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he did finally emerge, he was unable to give the benediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;rsquo;t told how, but the people finally realized he&amp;rsquo;d seen a vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-124-25&#34;&gt;Luke 1:24-25&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she kept herself hidden, saying, &amp;ldquo;Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference passage: Gen 30:23 She conceived and bore a son and said, &amp;ldquo;God has taken away my reproach.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;rsquo;t told exactly why she &amp;ldquo;kept herself hidden&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There might have been a custom of isolation during the early stages of pregnancy to guard against both natural and supernatural threats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-126-29-gabriel-visits-mary&#34;&gt;Luke 1:26-29 Gabriel visits Mary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, and he came to her and said, &amp;ldquo;Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!&amp;rdquo; But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hail Mary, full of grace&amp;rdquo; is scriptural&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nazareth is about 70 miles north of Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some scholars speculate that the entire town of 200 or so folks might all be from David&amp;rsquo;s line (as Joseph and Mary were) who relocated north at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was nothing notable about Nazareth (except perhaps in a negative sense as used in John 1:46); the major center was Sephorris, which is likely where Joseph and Jesus found carpentry and masonry work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-130-33-the-annunciation&#34;&gt;Luke 1:30-33 The Annunciation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30 And the angel said to her, &amp;ldquo;Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference verses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 7:14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im &amp;ndash; anu &amp;ndash; El = with us God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word &lt;em&gt;alma&lt;/em&gt; could mean &amp;ldquo;maiden&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;young woman,&amp;rdquo; and this is a point that many antagonists of Christianity will point out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Old Testament was translated into Greek a couple of centuries before Jesus was born. The Greek word &lt;em&gt;Parthenos&lt;/em&gt; used in Isaiah 7:4 is unmistakably a virgin as we think of the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the immediate context, this refers to King Ahaz&amp;rsquo;s son Hezekiah, but Christians see a double-fulfillment with Jesus. Often there is an immediate application and then a longer range application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virgin birth, along with the resurrection are targets for critics who just can&amp;rsquo;t accept the supernatural nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen 16:11 And the angel of the LORD said to her, &amp;ldquo;Behold, you are pregnant and shall bear a son. You shall call his name Ishmael, because the LORD has listened to your affliction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Sa 7:9,14 And I have been with you wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth&amp;hellip; I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 2:7 I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, &amp;ldquo;You are my Son; today I have begotten you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 132:11 The LORD swore to David a sure oath from which he will not turn back: &amp;ldquo;One of the sons of your body I will set on your throne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Sa 7:13 He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Sa 7:16 And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 9:7 Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protestants tend to distance themselves from the Catholic veneration of Mary, but let&amp;rsquo;s not forget Mary was the chosen woman to bear the messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She truly was blessed among all women, so we owe her due credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripture does not say that she herself was immaculately conceived, nor does it say that she remained a virgin after Jesus was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When discussing with people of different faith backgrounds, look for points of commonality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Catholics and Protestants would both agree that Mary is an incredible woman who was used by God, and the primary point of our focus should be on Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-134-38&#34;&gt;Luke 1:34-38&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And Mary said to the angel, &amp;ldquo;How will this be, since I am a virgin?&amp;rdquo; And the angel answered her, &amp;ldquo;The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy&amp;mdash;the Son of God. And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. For nothing will be impossible with God.&amp;rdquo; And Mary said, &amp;ldquo;Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.&amp;rdquo; And the angel departed from her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing about the Annunciation indicated that the conception would be supernatural, but perhaps Mary suspected or even physically felt something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking, Mary was a barren woman just like Sarah and Elizabeth; she just was not advanced in age. Let us not overlook the fact that God, once again, supernaturally opens a closed womb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wonder if, at her young age, she truly realized she was about to become a social outcast and the subject of vicious small-town gossip for supposed illegitimate pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we get to the &amp;ldquo;Genealogies&amp;rdquo; we&amp;rsquo;re going to study a guy by the name of Jeconiah in Jeremiah 22 and why the virgin birth may be particularly relevant to Jesus being of the &amp;ldquo;house and lineage of David.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Gideon and Zechariah, Mary does not ask for a sign. She just asks, how can these things be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is given one anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her aged and heretofore barren relative Elizabeth has also conceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her faithfulness here echos that of Ruth who places herself at the mercy of Naomi and then Boaz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we truly believe that &amp;ldquo;nothing is impossible with God&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-139-41&#34;&gt;Luke 1:39-41&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a town in Judah, and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke does not give a specific location for the home of Elizabeth and Zechariah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literary tradition from the 6th century identifies Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s hometown with Ein Kerem (about 6 miles west of Jerusalem) and the presence of two 4th-century churches indicates that the tradition is even older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Ein Kerem has a population of about 2000; it is essentially a suburb of Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-142-45-elizabeths-blessing&#34;&gt;Luke 1:42-45 Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s Blessing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and she exclaimed with a loud cry, &amp;ldquo;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-146-55----the-magnificat&#34;&gt;Luke 1:46-55 &amp;ndash; The &lt;em&gt;Magnificat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most beautiful expressions of glory and gratitude; it is very Psalm=like. The Holy Spirit was definitely present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The praise is similar to Hannah&amp;rsquo;s song in 1 Samuel 2 and has many allusions and themes from the Hebrew Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It begins with her personal praise and expands to the hope and promise of the Messianic redemption (the redemption that has its fulfillment in Revelation 19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;46 And Mary said, &amp;ldquo;My soul magnifies the Lord,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Sam 2:1 And Hannah prayed and said, &amp;ldquo;My heart exults in the LORD; my horn is exalted in the LORD. My mouth derides my enemies, because I rejoice in your salvation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;47 and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hab 3:18 yet I will rejoice in the LORD; I will take joy in the God of my salvation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word for salvation here is [יִשְׁעִֽי]{dir=&amp;ldquo;rtl&amp;rdquo;} &amp;ndash; Yesuha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;48 for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant. For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Sam 1:11 &amp;hellip;remember me and not forget your maidservant&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen 29:32 And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben, for she said, &amp;ldquo;Because the LORD has looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will love me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen 30:13 And Leah said, &amp;ldquo;Happy am I! For women have called me happy.&amp;rdquo; So she called his name Asher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;49 for he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psa 126:3 The LORD has done great things for us; we are glad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;50 And his mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psa 103:17 But the steadfast love of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, and his righteousness to children&amp;rsquo;s children,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;51 He has shown strength with his arm; He has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 136:12 with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, for his steadfast love endures forever;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 89:13 You have a mighty arm; strong is your hand, high your right hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 89:10 &amp;hellip;you scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;52 He has brought down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of humble estate;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Sa 2:7 The LORD makes poor and makes rich; He brings low and he exalts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 113:7 He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;53 He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He has sent away empty.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 107:9 For he satisfies the longing soul, and the hungry soul he fills with good things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Sa 2:5 Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, but those who were hungry have ceased to hunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;54 He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of His mercy,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 41:8 But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, the offspring of Abraham, my friend&amp;hellip;Fear not&amp;hellip; you men of Israel! I am the one who helps you, declares the LORD; your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 98:3 He has remembered his steadfast love and faithfulness to the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;55 as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his offspring forever.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exo 32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, &amp;lsquo;I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have promised I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit it forever.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mic 7:20 You will show faithfulness to Jacob and steadfast love to Abraham, as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will you notice God is not done with Israel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passages like this also demonstrate the interconnection between the Old and the New Testament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-156-58&#34;&gt;Luke 1:56-58&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And Mary remained with her about three months and returned to her home. Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son. And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child. And they would have called him Zechariah after his father,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 17:12 He who is eight days old among you shall be circumcised. Every male throughout your generations, whether born in your house or bought with your money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lev 12:3 And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-160-66-his-name-is-yochanon&#34;&gt;Luke 1:60-66 His name is Yochanon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;but his mother answered, &amp;ldquo;No; he shall be called John.&amp;rdquo; And they said to her, &amp;ldquo;None of your relatives is called by this name.&amp;rdquo; And they made signs to his father, inquiring what he wanted him to be called. And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, &amp;ldquo;His name is John.&amp;rdquo; And they all wondered. And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God. And fear came on all their neighbors. And all these things were talked about through all the hill country of Judea, and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, &amp;ldquo;What then will this child be?&amp;rdquo; For the hand of the Lord was with him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-167&#34;&gt;Luke 1:67&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-168-79-the-benedictus&#34;&gt;Luke 1:68-79 The &lt;em&gt;Benedictus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;68 &amp;ldquo;Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has visited and redeemed his people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 41:13 Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! Amen and Amen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 111:9 He sent redemption to his people; he has commanded his covenant forever. Holy and awesome is his name!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;69 and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Sa 2:10 he will give strength to his king and exalt the horn of his anointed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 132:17 There I will make a horn to sprout for David; I have prepared a lamp for my anointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;70 as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zec 7:7 Were not these the words that the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous, with her cities around her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited?&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;71 that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2Sa 22:18 He rescued me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;72-73 to show the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant, the oath that he swore to our father Abraham, to grant us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exo 32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, &amp;lsquo;I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have promised I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit it forever.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lev 26:42 then I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and I will remember my covenant with Isaac and my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;74-75 that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, might serve him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2Ki 17:39 but you shall fear the LORD your God, and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;76 And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 40:3 A voice cries: &amp;ldquo;In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mal 3:1 &amp;ldquo;Behold, I send my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me. And the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant in whom you delight, behold, he is coming, says the LORD of hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;77 to give knowledge of salvation to his people in the forgiveness of their sins,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isa 53:11 Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied; by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous, and he shall bear their iniquities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;78 because of the tender mercy of our God, whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mal 4:2 But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness shall rise with healing in its wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 60:2 For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the peoples; but the LORD will arise upon you, and his glory will be seen upon you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;79 to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 9:2 The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 42:6-7 &amp;ldquo;I am the LORD; I have called you in righteousness; I will take you by the hand and keep you; I will give you as a covenant for the people, a light for the nations, to open the eyes that are blind, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, from the prison those who sit in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro 3:17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-180&#34;&gt;Luke 1:80&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;80 And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GENEALOGIES demonstrates to us that Jesus is of the &amp;ldquo;house and lineage&amp;rdquo; of King David. Once, when Jesus was passing through the streets, some blind men called out to Him, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!” Why did they call Him “Son of David”? What does that title mean, and what is Jesus’ relationship to King David? In this chapter we explore the family tree of the Messiah.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The book of the generations (genealogy) of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen 5:1&lt;/sup&gt; This is the book of the generations of Adam. When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Son of Abraham = means a Jew. Matthew wants us to know that Jesus is Jewish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Son of David is a clear Messianic title. Matthew wants us to know that Jesus is the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew presents his genealogy in the Hebraic style of Genesis 5:1, which reads “this (is the) book of the generations of Adam” (although it is Luke, not Matthew, who presents us the lineage back to Adam).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genealogies were important legal documents to demonstrate lineage for the purposes of inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically records were kept in the temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was destroyed in 70 CE so were most of the records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, ANYONE after 70 CE could claim to be descended from David and there would be no way to prove or disprove it. A few would-be messiahs in history even tried to fabricate their lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the claim for Jesus’ lineage was made when it could still have been checked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen 17:7&lt;/sup&gt; And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2Sa 7:16&lt;/sup&gt; And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a candidate for Messiah is not a descendant from David AND Abraham, he is to be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God made eternal and unconditional covenants with both Abraham and David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 1:1 is the most important verse of the chapter as it establishes Jesus in both David’s line and Abraham’s line (with the remainder of the genealogy used to support the assertion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:2.60856in;height:1.95614in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Deu 17:15&lt;/sup&gt; you may indeed set a king over you whom the LORD your God will choose. &lt;strong&gt;One from among your brothers you shall set as king over you. You may not put a foreigner over you, who is not your brother&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any king, including, and especially the Messiah had to be Jewish by law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have an interesting Juxtaposition between Jesus, the rightful king, and King Herod, the presently reigning king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dichotomy is accented by geography. Above is a picture of Herod’s palace called Herodium (of course he named it after himself). Herodium is about 3 miles from Bethlehem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To varying degrees, all of the gospels portray Jesus the rightful king, messiah, and Son battling against the usurping forces, be they Herod, the political/religious establishment or the forces of spiritual darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herod, was NOT BORN King of the Jews, in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. He’s wasn’t Jewish by birth. He was an Idumean, which is to say an edomite, descended from Esau not Jacob. If you know anything about the history, the Edomites and the Israelites didn’t get along at all. During the period of the Maccabees, Herod’s family was forced to convert. Forced conversions, whether done by the greeks under Antiochus IV, the Jews under the Maccabeans, or the Christians and Muslims in later years, never seem to work out very well for both the converted and those forcing the conversions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. He therefore was not qualified to be King. In fact, he approached the Roman Senate to grant him that title, which they did in 39 BC. And in an irony of History, Rome didn’t even control the area at the time. The Parthians did. Herod pushed them out and secured the area for Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This adds some possible intrigue to &lt;sup&gt;Mat 2:1-2&lt;/sup&gt; Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, [2] saying, “Where is he who has been &lt;strong&gt;born king of the Jews&lt;/strong&gt;? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Magi approach Herod and ask, “where is he who has been BORN KING OF THE JEWS?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck Missler sees this as an intentional dig at Herod. In other words, “Not you, turkey. Where’s the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; king of the Jews?” Which of course sends Herod off in a fit of rage and we know from Matthew 2:4-5, Herod inquired of the birthplace of Messiah and was told it would be in Bethlehem. Eventually, he orders the execution of all males 2 years and younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, before this episode, the Talmud records that Herod once approached his leaders for the qualifications of a Jewish leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Sanhedrin explained Deuteronomy 17:15 to Herod, telling him that one must be naturally born Jewish, Herod naturally, was not pleased with the explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He ordered the execution of all of the Sanhedrin except one (b. Bava Batra 3b), which tells you all about Herod. “don’t shoot the messenger” was not in his vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster notes that Herod then sought to destroy all such records and people of the Davidic Royal line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This likely forced any direct descendant of David to flee from Bethlehem, just a stone’s throw away from Herod’s palace at Herodium, to the relative obscurity in Nazareth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far from being a boring list of names, the fact that Matthew’s genealogy is preserved may be the first recorded miracle in his gospel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.32569in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 1:1 establishes Jesus in David’s line and also in Abraham’s line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אדם  &lt;/span&gt;= Abraham, David, Messiah according to the sages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;matthew-12-6--abraham-to-solomon--luke-3138-adam-to-nathan&#34;&gt;Matthew 1:2-6 – Abraham to Solomon &amp;amp; Luke 31:38 Adam to Nathan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 1:2-6 ↓&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luke 3:38-31 ↑&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah and his brothers, Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Hezron, Ram, Amminadab, Nahshon, Salmon, Boaz by Rahab, Obed by Ruth, Jesse, David the king. And David was the father of &lt;strong&gt;Solomon&lt;/strong&gt; by the wife of Uriah…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Adam the Son of God, Seth, Enosh, Cainan, Mahalalel, Jared, Enoch, Methuseleh, Lamech, Noah, Shem, Arphaxhad, &lt;em&gt;Cainan&lt;/em&gt;, Shelah, Eber, Peleg, Reu, Serug, Nahor, Terah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, Perez, Hezron, &lt;em&gt;Arni, Admin&lt;/em&gt;, Amminadab, Nashon, Sala, Boaz, Obed, Jesse, David, &lt;strong&gt;Nathan&lt;/strong&gt;…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew is very much like an Old Testament genealogy that runs from oldest to newest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke follows the style of a Greco-Roman ancestry that runs from newest to oldest – Luke’s order is flipped above to make comparisons easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew is interested in presenting Jesus as the Jewish Messiah, so his genealogy goes back to Abraham the first Jew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke is interested in presenting us the ancestry of the son of Man, so he’s going to go all the way back to Adam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to Abraham, EVERYONE was a “gentile” (if you’ll pardon the anachronism).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke, which was widely circulated in Gentile regions, wanted gentiles to know Jesus is their Messiah too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he stresses in Luke Volume II (the book we know as Acts), he wants us to know Gentiles are included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam to Noah is the same list as Genesis 5, and Shem to Terah, is roughly the same list as Genesis 11:10-25 (see discussion on potential discrepancies below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Gospels are basically the same from Abraham to David (see potential discrepancies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will touch on the women in Matthew’s gospel in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential discrepancies in this section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew omits some names in this section and omits a LOT of names in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener notes this is not unusual for ancient genealogies, and we may have an element of the Holy Spirit blotting out certain names from the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew conspicuously skips three kings of Judah: Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah (compare 1 Chronicles 3:10-16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was interested in preserving 14 generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke inserts someone named “Cainan” inbetween Arphaxhad and Shelah in Abraham’s line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cainan is not mentioned in Genesis 11l&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this is the identical name to the Cainan in Noah’s line, this is possibly a copyist’s error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note this is why we say the Bible is inerrant &lt;strong&gt;in the original manuscripts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several known copyist errors, most notably in John 5:3-4;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These do not detract from the overall inerrancy of Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke inserts Arni and Admin, which are not included in the Old Testament accounts of David’s lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arni is potentially a variant spelling of Ram, we don’t know where Admin came from. Perhaps it’s an &lt;em&gt;admin&lt;/em&gt;istrative error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big thing to note is that Matthew’s list runs through Solomon, the first surviving son of David and the wife of Uriah, while Luke’s runs through Nathan, the second surviving son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note also that Bathsheba is referred to only indirectly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In fact, she is never named in the Bible after she dies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nothing is accidental in the Bible. The Holy Spirit engineers and orchestrates every letter. For her not to be named is a “dis” from the Holy Spirit!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Far from being an innocent victim, perhaps she was the instigator of the entire episode. She did seem to relish her position as Queen Mother in 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Kings 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In contrast, Rahab repented, Tamar was declared righteous by Judah himself, and if you know anything about Ruth and Boaz, there was nothing inappropriate about their relationship.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bad-girls-of-the-bible&#34;&gt;Bad Girls of the Bible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was highly unusual for an ancient genealogy to include women&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All five women listed, including Mary in verse 16, were tainted by scandal (real or suspected).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster posits that by including the first four women, Matthew sought to make any scandal regarding Mary irrelevant to Jesus’ claim to be the Messiah. The ancients held a much wider view of “mother” and “father” than we do today, so if David had a few less than reputable “mothers” in his line and is still regarded as the greatest King of Israel, how much more should Jesus be regarded as one greater than David even though there are some questions regarding His lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tamar&#34;&gt;Tamar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamar relies on the Levirate Marriage law: &lt;sup&gt;Deu 25:5-6&lt;/sup&gt; If brothers dwell together, and one of them dies and has no son, the wife of the dead man shall not be married outside the family to a stranger. Her husband&amp;rsquo;s brother shall go in to her and take her as his wife and perform the duty of a husband&amp;rsquo;s brother to her. And the first son whom she bears shall succeed to the name of his dead brother, that his name may not be blotted out of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamar was the daughter in law of Judah. We can read the complete story in Genesis 38.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She married one of Judah’s sons a guy by the name of Er, but he was wicked and was struck down by the LORD before they had children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In accordance with the law of the Levirate marriage, Judah was REQUIRED to have Tamar marry the next available male, Onan, to marry Tamar and have a child in the name of the deceased son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judah did this but THAT son was also wicked and was struck down (a very R-rated story- the Bible tells it like it is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re getting an idea that maybe Judah was a less than stellar father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judah had a third son, Shelah, but Judah feared He would die along the others, as if it was Tamar who was the bad news causing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judah promised to give Shelah to Tamar but told her to wait until he was older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judah was likely hoping Tamar would go off and find someone else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this is now the Royal line of Judah that is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamar realizes Judah is going to renege on his word so she takes matters into her own hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She KNOWS that Judah’s line must continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She dresses up as a harlot and entices none other than Judah, her father-in-law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judah doesn’t have cash on hand so he leaves his staff, cord and signet ring as a down payment. The next day he goes to collect but Tamar has vanished. He asks around but is told “there is no harlot here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three months later Tamar is showing. When Judah learns of it, he is incensed at the shame she has brough on the family (seriously?) and orders her burned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen 38:24-26&lt;/sup&gt; About three months later Judah was told, “Tamar your daughter-in-law has been immoral. Moreover, she is pregnant by immorality.” And Judah said, “Bring her out, and let her be burned.” As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law, “By the man to whom these belong, I am pregnant.” And she said, “Please identify whose these are, the signet and the cord and the staff.” Then Judah identified them and said, “She is more righteous than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah.” And he did not know her again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says “She is more righteous than I.” which is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamar is untimately proclaimed righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She thwarted the attack on the Royal Line and had twins, Perez and Zerah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see how these seemingly obscure laws in the Torah like the Law of the Levirate Marriage are actually critical to the Lines of David and Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another interesting tidbit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Deu 23:2&lt;/sup&gt; “No one born of a forbidden union may enter the assembly of the LORD. Even to the tenth generation, none of his descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being “righteous” it was still a forbidden union according to the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God apparently means what He says when He says “10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; generation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perez by Tamar, Hezron, Ram, Amminadab, Nahshon, Salmon, Boaz, Obed, Jesse, David – 10 Generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rahab&#34;&gt;Rahab&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Jos 2:12-13&lt;/sup&gt; Now then, please swear to me by the LORD that, as I have dealt kindly with you, you also will deal kindly with my father&amp;rsquo;s house, and give me a sure sign that you will save alive my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and deliver our lives from death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahab was an actual harlot in Jericho who ends up protecting Joshua’s men in exchange for protection. You can read the story in Joshua 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tradition holds that she repented and found grace and mercy by following the God of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t say that Grace and Mercy are New Testament concepts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is lauded in the Hebrews 11 Hall of faith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Heb 11:31** **&lt;/sup&gt;By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had given a friendly welcome to the spies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ruth&#34;&gt;Ruth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruth relies on the Kinsman Redeemer Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Lev 25:25&lt;/sup&gt; “If your brother becomes poor and sells part of his property, then his nearest redeemer shall come and redeem what his brother has sold.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the passage that causes many to associate Ruth with scandal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rth 3:7-9&lt;/sup&gt; And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then she came softly and uncovered his feet and lay down. At midnight the man was startled and turned over, and behold, a woman lay at his feet! He said, “Who are you?” And she answered, “I am Ruth, your servant (handmaid). Spread your wings over your servant, for you are a redeemer.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know anything about Ruth and Boaz, you know it was unlikely there was any mischief before marriage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ruth 3, she “uncovers his feet”, which to be fair, in the Bible is often a euphemism for other things and then asks him to “spread your wing or hem/skirt over me (same wing and hem/corner are the same word in Hebrew). Her request was scandalous but not for the reason you may be thinking. As chuck Missler says, “she wasn’t propositioning him, it’s far worse than that. She was asking for his protection. In other words, she was asking him to make good on his duty to be a kinsman redeemer – another Old Testament law that turns out to be critically important to Jesus’ lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scandal part is that Moabites were the sworn enemies of Israel and Boaz was forbidden by law from marrying ruth, but he must make an exception (and I suspect he did so gladly) because of the overriding law of the Kinsman redeemer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that is important to know about the application of Jewish law. Whenever there is a negative commandment that conflicts with a positive one, the positive one wins out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is going to make use of this guideline frequently, particularly with the so-called Sabbath controversies. He’s not overriding the law; he’s following the law strictly and perfectly, much more perfectly than the prevailing attitudes of the day were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case the law said an Israelite was forbidden from marrying a moabitie but the positive command required the nearer kinsman to redeem.Ruth who earlier made the famous proclamation of “where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God my God.” (Ruth 1:16) now says “I am your servant or some translations say handmaid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Luk 1:38&lt;/sup&gt; And Mary said, “Behold, I am the servant (handmaid) of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mary’s words in Luke 1:38 echo ruth’s faithfulness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in Biblical typology Boaz is a type of Jesus and Ruth, a gentile is a picture of us, the gentile church. We are helpless and poor without our Redeemer. With Jesus we are royalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mary&#34;&gt;Mary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve talked and will talk a lot more about her righteousness but this doesn’t keep detractors from raising the appearance of scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Joseph appears initially ready to believe the scandal (not without reason of course)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mat 1:18-19&lt;/sup&gt; Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. [19] And her husband Joseph, being a just man and &lt;strong&gt;unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that Jesus’ questionable lineage was used by His detractors in John 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Joh 8:18-19&lt;/sup&gt; I am the one who bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about me.” [19] They said to him therefore, &lt;strong&gt;“Where is your Father?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although I just said to give others the benefit of the doubt, we can tell by the context of the passage that they are being absolutely nasty here!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psalms appear to speak of Jesus’ childhood struggles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Psa 69:8-12&lt;/sup&gt; I have become a &lt;strong&gt;stranger to my brothers, an alien to my mother&amp;rsquo;s sons&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;For zeal for your house has consumed me&lt;/em&gt;, and the reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me. When I wept and humbled my soul with fasting, it became my reproach. When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them. &lt;strong&gt;I am the talk of those who sit in the gate, and the drunkards make songs about me&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s hard to imagine growing up and having Jesus as a half-brother. I’m sure James, Jude and the others were none too thrilled at being told “why can’t you be more like Yeshua?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-wife-of-uriah-bathsheba&#34;&gt;The wife of Uriah (Bathsheba)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:3.77014in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a familiar story but 2 Samuel 11 says it was the time when the Kings should have been on the battlefield but David stayed back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He eyes Bathsheba bathing and the rest as they say his history&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2Sa 11:4-5&lt;/sup&gt; So David sent messengers and took her, and she came to him, and he lay with her. (Now she had been purifying herself from her uncleanness.) Then she returned to her house. And the woman conceived, and she sent and told David, “I am pregnant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He next tries to cover up by having Uriah lay with his wife, which he refused to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The army (again, where David SHOULD have been) was supposed to be in a state of ritual purity, specifically abstaining from marital relations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David then has Uriah eliminated so he can openly marry his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great example of the difference between the “vertical” and the “horizontal” realms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the vertical- our relationship with God– David repented and was forgiven. In acts 13, David is still referred to as a man after God’s own heart and Psalm 51 is a beautiful expression of repentence and forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horizontally – our relationship with others - there are still consequences when we sin. This episode resulted in David’s family life becoming an absolute train-wreck&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture above is inside the same archaeological park we talked about with David’s harp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists think David’s palace was at the top, and you can see how steep the incline is with the houses below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would have been quite easy for the king to walk out and look down into the houses below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some speculation as to whether this was a sexual assault by David. I tend not to see this and we get a clue why in Matthew 1:6. Notice Bathsheba is not named.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact she is NEVER named in the Bible after she dies, and only once during the episode in question is she named as “Bathsheba”, otherwise it’s the “wife of Uriah” or some other pronoun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some scholars see this as a “dis” from the Holy Spirit which to me suggests she knew exactly what she was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew continues this trend of not uttering her name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the other four women who are named either engaged in or had the appearance of scandal only without doing anything wrong. The contrast suggests to some commentators that Bathsheba never repented of her role in all of the drama. That is a speculation but we can see in 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Kings 2, Bathsheba seems to relish her power and position as the Queen Mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet through it all, God orchestrated the messianic line through the sons of David and Bathsheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

After the deportation, Jeconiah, Shealtiel, Zerubbabel, Abiud, Eliakim, Azor, Zadok, Achim, Eliud, Eleazar, Matthan, &lt;strong&gt;Jacob&lt;/strong&gt; the father of Joseph the &lt;strong&gt;husband&lt;/strong&gt; of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Messiah.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;↓ &lt;sup&gt;Luke 3:23&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age, being &lt;del&gt;the&lt;/del&gt; son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew goes from Solomon through Jacob&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He clearly says Joseph is the husband of Mary of whom Jesus was born; he does not say Joseph is the father of Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke goes from Nathan through Heli&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In everyday language, the fact that Luke adds, “as was supposed” implies that Jesus is not actually the son of Joseph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the original Greek, there is no “the” before “son (supposed) of Joseph”, which further distinguishes Joseph from Jesus’ direct ancestors. “By the omission of the article, Joseph’s name is separated from the genealogical chain and accorded a place of its own” (&lt;em&gt;Rienecker&lt;/em&gt; as cited in Stern’s commentary).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler and other commentators see far more going on with the word ενομιζετο, which has as its root &lt;em&gt;nomos&lt;/em&gt;, meaning “law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They speculate that there was a legal adoption (relying completely on the Torah’s rulings) of Jesus by Joseph which gives Jesus claim to the Davidic line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other potential discrepancies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall Luke has 76 names while Matthew has 41 names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew omits Ahaziah, Joash and Amaziah (compare 1 Chronicles 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought is they were so bad they were blotted out according to Deuteronomy 29:20 -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deu 29:20 The LORD will not be willing to forgive him, and the LORD will blot out his name from under heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, Keener notes that omitting some names is not unexpected with ancient genealogies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I’ve said before, of all the Gospel writers Luke is the one most interested in chronology. Matthew is more interested in symbolism and the number 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew’s math doesn’t add up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t get from 586, the main deportation to Babylon and the destruction of Jerusalm to 5 BC and the birth of Jesus with only 14 generations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew lists Jeconiah twice and counts him in both groups of 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler suggests a copyists error with the second Jeconiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last two kings before the deportation were Jehoakim, the direct descendant of Josiah and Jehoiachin, called Jeconiah or Coniah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke and Matthew apparently have some overlap in the lines with Shealtiel and Zerubabbel or it could be just a coincidence with the same names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-deportation-to-babylon&#34;&gt;The deportation to Babylon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Babylon” is a recurring theme in the Bible, particularly the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BCE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern mural depicts Israel’s deportation to Babylon. The words in the upper right say “Galut Bavel,” Exile (to) Babylon&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to place ourselves in the shoes of the Jews of that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve been promised that you’re God’s people through the Mosaic Covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve been promised the land forever through the Abrahamic Covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve been promised that David’s throne will endure forever through the Davidic Covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerusalem was thought to be impregnable, particularly after the Assyrians failed (2 Kings 19:31-36).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet all that is lost on the 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of Av in -586.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had God’s promises failed? Maybe He’s not really all-powerful or all-good. Maybe we sinned. bad that we’re now beyond His reach. Maybe we misread the promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the question many ask today in the face of tragedy or evil is, “How could a good God let this happen?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then what do you do next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sing the blues (Lamentations)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn your back on God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reinvent/reapply/spiritualize the Bible passages pertaining to the promises&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fall on your knees in repentance and draw near to God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we do today, the people back then did all those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as Gettysburg, Pearl Harbor, the JFK assassination, or 9/11 is are those critical moments in history for Americans, the Babylonian captivity is such a moment for Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And a few years later in 70 CE, another such moment will occur: the Roman destruction of Jerusalem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jeconiah&#34;&gt;Jeconiah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew includes Jeconiah in the Royal Line of Messiah, but there’s a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jeremiah 22, God is so fed up with Jeconiah, he puts a curse on him AND his offspring, saying no offspring of his will ever rule in Judah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Jeconiah is in the Line of Jesus. So how can Jesus rule as King Messiah if that very same Royal Line is cursed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chuck Missler says, we can imagine Satan and his demons rejoicing in the halls of hell – they finally polluted the royal line and prevented Messiah. All those attacks on the royal line from Adam and Eve, to Cain and Abel, to Judah and Tamar to David and Bathsheba, to the countless other times Satan tried to wipe out the line, finally worked! We’ve finally prevented the Messiah from ruling!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we need to imagine God turning to the Angels and saying “Watch what I do next!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the fine print! No OFFSPRING of Jeconiah’s shall sit on the Throne of David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image5.png&#34; style=&#34;width:3.95053in;height:3.9826in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s put this all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we note that this is only a speculation, but it’s the one that appears to be held by most (but not all) Protestant commentators, though it’s not without its complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion is Matthew is presenting Joseph’s Genealogy and Luke is giving us Mary’s line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presents Jesus as the Jewish King/Messiah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genealogy begins with Abraham, the father of the Jewish people,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;presents the Legal/Royal Line through Joseph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his gospel, Matthew focuses much more on Joseph than on Mary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE VIRGIN BIRTH directly circumvents the blood curse on Jeconiah, yet through an adoption procedure (hinted at by the word enomiZETo), Jesus has every right to David’s Royal Line JUST AS IF he were Joseph’s natural son&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the “HOUSE OF DAVID”, the Royal line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the virgin birth also avoids the original sin that happens anytime a human x and a human y chromosome merge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presents Jesus as the perfect man/last Adam/savior of all humanity,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genealogy begins with Adam, the first man,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enomiZETO suggests Joseph adopted Jesus (or potentially some other similar adoption leveraging either the Daughters of Zelophehad (Numbers 27) or the Levirate Marriage (Deut 25) rulings in the Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presents the Blood line through Mary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his gospel, Luke focuses much more on Mary than on Joseph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the LINEAGE OF DAVID, the blood line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Joseph is both of the House and Lineage of David (Luke 2:4), he contains the curse of Jeconiah and can never rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is also both of the House and Lineage of David, but He does NOT contain the curse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why the Virgin Birth is more than a simple sign of the Messiah, it is critical to Jesus’ claim to be the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-reconciliation-theories&#34;&gt;Other Reconciliation theories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, as Stern points out “The Genealogies of both Matthew and Luke employ unusual language in connection with Yeshua/Jesus and with good reason. Both assert Yeshua had no human father in the ordinary sense of the word but that the virgin Mary was caused to bear Him by the holy spirit in a supernatural way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other suggestions over the years (some with very strong traditional support) include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that Jeconiah repented so the need to circumvent the blood curse is null and void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commentaries note that Jeconiah was NOT “Childless” as the Bible records his offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a counter-argument, we would say that none of those children reigned as KING of Judah. Some were lower-level administrators of the region but that’s not the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the line of David continued, but his descendants no longer possessed the throne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew is Mary’s line by birth through Solomon and Luke is Joseph’s through Nathan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matthew directly mentions Mary and the other women, while Luke does not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph’s father Jacob died, and Heli was his adopted father prior to Mary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heli died and his widow remarried Jacob&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew and Luke recorded the same genealogy differently because they had different sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes either Matthew or Luke in error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This commentator would reject that premise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skeptic would say, “See? The Bible is full of contradictions and can’t be trusted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our opinion this is an intellectually dishonest answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless a witness gives us a reason to think they are lying or delusional, we give them the benefit of the doubt that what they are recounting is the truth as they see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOWEVER God choose to authenticate Jesus’ claim to be the Messiah, we’re very thankful He did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Heb 11:6&lt;/sup&gt; And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that &lt;strong&gt;He rewards those who (diligently) seek Him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Tit 3:9&lt;/sup&gt; But &lt;strong&gt;avoid foolish controversies, genealogies&lt;/strong&gt;, dissensions, and quarrels about the law, for they are &lt;strong&gt;unprofitable and worthless&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us strive to be diligent seekers but not engage in foolish and worthless controversies!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;matthew-112-17-jeconiah-to-jesus&#34;&gt;Matthew 1:12-17: Jeconiah to Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And after the deportation to Babylon: Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel, and Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, and Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor, and Azor the father of Zadok, and Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud, and Eliud the father of Eleazar, and Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ. . all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a problem with Jeconiah, which we’ll discuss after we look at Luke’s genealogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew demonstrates that the line of David continued through Jesus even though David’s descendants no longer possessed the throne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The math doesn’t work – you can’t get 14 generations from -586 to -5, the time of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more puzzling is Matthew has to count Jeconiah twice to get 14 from David to Babylon and also from Babylon to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous theories have emerged such as counting Joseph and Mary separately, but these are all speculation and not really pertinent to our purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew is more interested in the pattern of 14, which someone with a Hebraic mindset would have noticed right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew spelling of David adds up to 14:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ד&lt;/span&gt; = D = 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ו&lt;/span&gt; = V = 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ד&lt;/span&gt; = D = 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4+6+4 = 14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another prominent theory is based on the moon phases and their connection to the House of David:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 89:35-37 Once for all I have sworn by my holiness; I will not lie to David. His offspring shall endure forever, his throne as long as the sun before me. &lt;strong&gt;Like the moon, it shall be established forever, a faithful witness in the skies&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron Eby speculates that the original audience would have noted the roughly 14 days from New Moon to Full Moon, darkness to light (Abraham to David) and then the roughly 14 days from Full Moon to New Moon, light to darkness (David to Jeconiah and the deportation), with the dark to light pattern repeated from Jeconiah to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew is clearly establishing a link to David and that Yeshua is the rightful descendant of David’s royal line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-323-30&#34;&gt;Luke 3:23-30&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph, the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai, the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda, the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri, the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er, the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim, the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek genealogies were often reverse chronological&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase “as was supposed” has puzzled scholars&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek word is a variation of nomitzo, which can mean “reckoned as by law” (&lt;em&gt;nomos&lt;/em&gt; = law).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One theory is that Luke is communicating Jesus is not the natural son of Joseph but an adopted son, just like adoptive parents go through a legal process today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we would call Eli the “father in law” of Joseph, but that type of terminology likely didn’t exist in 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century Judaism. According to this interpretation, Eli is Mary’s father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus a common interpretation is that Matthew is giving us the &lt;strong&gt;royal&lt;/strong&gt; line of Jesus through David and Solomon, while Luke is giving us the &lt;strong&gt;blood&lt;/strong&gt; line of Jesus through David and Nathan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus can be said that Jesus is of the house** (royal) and &lt;strong&gt;lineage&lt;/strong&gt; (blood) of David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about Jeconiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jeconiah-and-the-blood-curse&#34;&gt;Jeconiah and the blood curse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jer 22:24-30 “As I live, declares the LORD, though Coniah (i.e. Jeconiah) the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were the signet ring on my right hand, yet I would tear you off [25] and give you into the hand of those who seek your life, into the hand of those of whom you are afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans. [26] I will hurl you and the mother who bore you into another country, where you were not born, and there you shall die. [27] But to the land to which they will long to return, there they shall not return.” [28] Is this man Coniah a despised, broken pot, a vessel no one cares for? Why are he and his children hurled and cast into a land that they do not know? [29] O land, land, land, hear the word of the LORD! [30] Thus says the LORD: “Write this man down as childless, a man who shall not succeed in his days, for none of his offspring shall succeed in sitting on the throne of David and ruling again in Judah.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the promise made to David, Jeconiah was apparently so evil that God pronounced a curse on his line in verse 30: “none of his offspring shall succeed in sitting on the throne of David and ruling again in Judah.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have a problem. The Messiah is supposed to come from David’s royal line yet God just pronounced a blood curse on that line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can imagine Satan and his demons rejoicing, thinking God boxed Himself into a corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we can imagine God saying, “watch what I do next!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leading conjecture is that Matthew establishes Joseph as the &lt;strong&gt;legal father&lt;/strong&gt; through his marriage to Mary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, Jesus is legally entitled to be in David’s Royal line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Jesus is not Joseph’s biological son, Jesus does not carry the blood curse of Jeconiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke establishes Jesus as being from the non-cursed blood line to David through Nathan and Mary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In other words, The ONLY way around the curse is through a virgin birth and adoption.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that doesn’t make you go “wow” you’ve either heard the story before, or you weren’t paying attention!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other conjectures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some scholars reverse this and say Matthew is Mary’s and Luke’s is Joseph. If so, a problem is that Mary is in Jeconiah’s line and would carry the blood curse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that Jeconiah repented and God accepted his contrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus it is later written that Jeconiah had offspring who ruled Judea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The counter argument to this is they were local govenors of Judah under Persian rule, they were not monarchs. &lt;em&gt;The line of David may have continued, continued but his descendants no longer possessed the throne.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Genesis 4:1 - 5:32&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;
Synopsis - Eve gives birth to two sons, Cain and Abel. Cain quarrels with Abel and murders him, and becomes a rootless wanderer with wicked descendants. A third son, Seth, is born to Adam. Enoch, the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; from Adam walked with God, then was taken up without dying. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/246609/jewish/The-Story-of-Noah-and-the-Ark-in-the-Bible.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the tenth from Adam, is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chabad.org/multimedia/video_cdo/aid/4633395/jewish/Was-Noah-Truly-Righteous.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the only righteous man&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in a corrupt world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;genesis-4&#34;&gt;Genesis 4&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-41-5-the-birth-of-cain-and-abel&#34;&gt;Genesis 4:1-5 THE BIRTH OF CAIN AND ABEL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, “I have gotten a man with the help of the LORD.” And again, she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a worker of the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground, and Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering, but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his face fell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam and Eve believed Cain was the promised seed of the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course he forfeited any hope of this by his unholy actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it like us to expect prophecy to be fulfilled in our day and age?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until this point, no offerings were documented as being required, although there could have been such a requirement that wasn’t written down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is reasonable to assume this is not the first time they offered something – at some point, they must have been taught the right way and the wrong way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that Adam went to Jerusalem after being banished from the Garden and built the first altar on Mount Moriah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, tradition says that all of this took place on Mount Moriah, the place we know today as the Temple Mount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First documented religious service; first competition; first murder. These three things are interconnected. When the irreligious see the bad behavior of believers, they naturally want no part of it.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been said that Christianity is not a religion, it’s a relationship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A personal relationship with God and Jesus – Deuteronomy 6:5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A personal commitment to love our neighbors as ourselves – Leviticus 19:18&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abel accepted and Cain rejected&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it because Cain didn’t offer blood?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. This may be an example of Christians knowing just enough about the Levitical sacrificial system to be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both grain and meat offerings are later commanded by God, and the Torah explicitly allows a person to bring a grain offering instead of an animal sacrifice for a sin offering.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the word used in Genesis 4:3-5 is &lt;em&gt;mincha&lt;/em&gt;, which is most closely associated with the grain offering in Leviticus 2.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cain’s occupation was a worker of the ground – he would be expected to bring an offering from the produce grown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tithe in dollars not pounds, because my income is in dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone in England would not be expected to tithe in dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the position that Abel’s meat offering was favored solely because it was a meat offering may have some typological merit in that foreshadows Jesus’ sacrifice, but it has little basis in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should always let the Bible be our first go-to reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Apostolic writings often provide more detail than we are given in the Hebrew Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this situation, John and the writer to the Hebrews tell us exactly why Cain’s offering was rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heb 11:4 By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, through which he was commended as righteous, God commending him by accepting his gifts. And through his faith, though he died, he still speaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Jn 3:12 We should not be like Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother&amp;rsquo;s righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biblical answer to why Abel’s sacrifice was accepted Is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abel’s offering was accepted because he was a righteous person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cain’s offering was rejected because he was a wicked person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, we can reasonably conclude that Cain had something in his heart that polluted his gift to God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 29:13 And the Lord said: “Because this people draw near with their mouth and honor me with their lips, while their hearts are far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment taught by men,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God would rather not have any offering than one made with a polluted heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the same with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 5:23-24 “So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First, be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t required to bring any offers, such as a tithe, but if we do we should never do it begrudgingly or if we are holding a grudge against someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus makes this point in Matthew 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scary thing is we aren’t told whether our gifts are accepted or not. Sure, the church cashes our checks but that’s not the same thing as an offering pleasing to God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this same sermon, Jesus also teaches in Matthew six that if we don’t give in secret, then any accolades we receive from men may be our reward. So the end of year tax deduction letter I get may not accrue any reward in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say, God looks at the heart as He says in 1 Samuel 16. Our offering is just what man sees. The heart was the difference between Cain’s offering and Abel&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-46-7-god-give-cain-a-second-chance&#34;&gt;Genesis 4:6-7 GOD GIVE CAIN A SECOND CHANCE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Cain, “Why are you angry, and why has your face fallen? If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is contrary to you, but you must rule over it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-48-15-cain-murders-abel&#34;&gt;Genesis 4:8-15 CAIN MURDERS ABEL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cain spoke to Abel his brother. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD said to Cain, “Where is Abel your brother?” He said, “I do not know; am I my brother&amp;rsquo;s keeper?” And the LORD said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother&amp;rsquo;s blood is crying to me from the ground. And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother&amp;rsquo;s blood from your hand. When you work the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.” Cain said to the LORD, “My punishment is greater than I can bear. Behold, you have driven me today away from the ground, and from your face I shall be hidden. I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.” Then the LORD said to him, “Not so! If anyone kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.” And the LORD put a mark on Cain, lest any who found him should attack him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do well&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above conclusion that Abel’s gift was accepted because he was a good person presents a problem if our “New Testament” theology holds that “all our righteousness was as filthy rags and we can’t bring any good work before the Lord.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches that our works matter – here God is imploring Cain to repent and do good deeds if he wants to be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not just an “Old Testament” teaching because, as we’ve just seen, the Apostolic authors affirm it, as does Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note also that Hebrew says Abel was righteous by faith (Heb 11:4 By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you may be asking which is it? By faith, or by works? The answer is “yes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is no difficulty here. Abel’s deeds were righteous because he was a man of faith.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have faith, we should be displaying good works. We don’t do good works to get saved; we do good works because we are saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sin croucheth at the door&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note immediately after the promise of a Messiah from Eve in Genesis 3:15, there is an immediate satanic attack on Eve’s firstborn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s warning to Cain went ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have an enemy who tempts us to sin but we must rule over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the moment-by-moment choice to sin or not to sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cain angry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 5:21-22 “You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.’ [22] But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the hell of fire. So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cain committed the murder in his heart in verse 5 and with his hands in verse 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abel as first martyr&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mat 23:34-35 (Luke 11:49-51) Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from town to town, [35] so that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No words of Abel are documented&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was he killed strictly because of his right standing position with the Lord?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So within a few minutes, his good deeds were earning him favor with God and those good deeds would also get him martyred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there someone else who was killed for who He was without opening His mouth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In opposition to “name it and claim it,” Jesus promises us the same kind of tribulation and hatred by the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense, if the world doesn’t hate us, we might be doing something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blood speaks out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 6:10 They cried out with a loud voice, “O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before you will judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heb 12:24 and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that Abel’s soul still speaks condemning every murder and every time an innocent drop of blood is shed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a lot more going on with our blood than we realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tradition also says that Cain’s “fugitive and wandering” soul has no rest.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark of Cain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, there were now more than three people living since Cain is worried about a relative of Abel acting as the “Avenger of blood.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t know what the mark was – it was unlikely to be a tatoo or some type of mutilation since both of these are later prohibited in the Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word is “ot” which means a literal or figurative sign (and is even the word for “letter” as in “a”, “b”, “c”…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah’s rainbow is another “ot” (Gen 9:12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s words are to be an “ot” on the right hand and they shall be as frontlets between the eyes (Deut 6:8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the “sign” could simply be a promise from God, who knows the end from the beginning, that Cain was not to be touched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In His Dust&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cain’s sin had long-term consequences. In Jewish thought if you kill a life, you have killed a generation. If being evil has severe negative consequences in this life, how much more is the opposite true? How much more will our righteous acts be a blessing to others in this life as well as be credited as “gold silver and precious stones” in the next! If we teach a young person to follow Yeshua and take his or her Bible seriously, we are impacting not only that person’s life but who knows how many people in future generations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-416-24-the-children-of-cain-and-a-godless-civilization&#34;&gt;Genesis 4:16-24 THE CHILDREN OF CAIN AND A GODLESS CIVILIZATION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Cain went away from the presence of the LORD and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden. Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he built a city, he called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch. To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech. And Lamech took two wives. The name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock. His brother&amp;rsquo;s name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe. Zillah also bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah. Lamech said to his wives: “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, listen to what I say: I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me. If Cain&amp;rsquo;s revenge is sevenfold, then Lamech&amp;rsquo;s is seventy-sevenfold.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enoch and Lamech – Cain’s descendants Enoch and Lamech are not the same as the Enoch and Lamech in Seth’s line in Genesis 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common “newbie” question is “where did Cain get his wife?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is in Genesis 5:4, “The days of Adam after he fathered Seth were 800 years; and he had other sons and daughters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 930 years, Adam and Eve could have had a lot of kids, and they would have had a lot of kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cain married his sister or his niece – there really was no other option at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the first mention of polygamy and it’s very much in a negative context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamech was a bad dude and he is recorded as being the first polygamist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical reasons for polygamy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women may have outnumbered men&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don’t know this, but it wouldn’t be surprising given what was likely a high rate of maternal as well as infant mortality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polygamy resulted in being fruitful and multiplying the earth faster than monogamous relationships would have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More workers allowed farming and hunting efforts to be more productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But God clearly said “TWO shall become one flesh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is wrong to use our circumstances around us as a rationale to violate God’s commands, which is what Lamech and the Biblical polygamists (including the venerated patriarchs) did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple partners led to big trouble for Abraham and Jacob!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears Cain’s line is bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition hold that Lamech killed Tubal-cain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feinberg notes the contrast between the detail we get of Seth’s line in Genesis five with the rather limited detail of Cain’s line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t told explicitly but it’s a reasonable inference that Cain’s line was wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jude refers to the “way of Cain”: Jud 1:11 Woe to them! For they walked in the way of Cain and abandoned themselves for the sake of gain to Balaam&amp;rsquo;s error and perished in Korah&amp;rsquo;s rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do know that everyone apart from Noah was evil and the world was not a good place to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen 6:5 The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamech’s sons were pioneers in the areas of technology and the arts, and apparently were celebrated for their achievements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t told anything to the effect of these kids not walking in the ways of their father, so we can conclude that Lamech did not raise his sons to know the Lord and that they used their talents for self-serving purposes, turning their back on the one in whose Image they were created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We too are blessed with diverse talents, skills, and creative abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we using these for our own glory or for his?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Godless progress is not progress.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventy times seven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s safe to say, Lamech had “an overdeveloped sense of vengeance. It’s going to get (him) into trouble one day.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn’t hesitate to murder at the slightest offense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin to see how bad the days of Genesis 6:5 were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster writes, “Jesus corrects Lamech’s sadistic mathematics by turning the same equation around and applying it to forgiveness.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 18:21-22 Then Peter came up and said to him, “Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?” [22] Jesus said to him, “I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time we are injured or offended, we should remember Lamech’s position and then immediately substitute that with Jesus’ instruction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-425-26-the-birth-of-seth&#34;&gt;Genesis 4:25-26 THE BIRTH OF SETH&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Seth, for she said, “God has appointed for me another offspring instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. At that time people began to call upon the name of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Appointed”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve, no doubt still hopeful that her direct offspring would be the promised Messiah named Abel’s replacement “Seth”, which in Hebrew is &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;שׁת&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is linguistically connected to Genesis 3:15: &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אשׁית&lt;/span&gt; = “I will put” or “I will appoint”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve hoped that Seth would be the appointed Messiah who would come to correct the evil state the world was in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 5:3 tells us that Adam was 130 when Seth was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, a lot of bad stuff happened in those 130 years and in the remaining 800 years of Adam’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine knowing Eden and now seeing the thoughts and deeds of his offspring focused on “only evil all the day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enosh means man but in the sense of mortal man, not in the sense of Adam, mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Call upon the name of the Lord”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many Hebrew verbs, the word here for “call”, Qara, can have a wide range of meanings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have this in English too. Calling by name has a very different meaning than “name-calling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unnuanced reading might suggest men who had previously forgotten about God now began to invoke His name once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other scholars note man’s general descent into evil and would read this as “men began to &lt;em&gt;profane&lt;/em&gt; the name of the LORD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-51-20-adams-genealogy&#34;&gt;Genesis 5:1-20 Adam’s Genealogy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the book of the generations of Adam. When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God. Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them Man when they were created. When Adam had lived 130 years, he fathered a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth. The days of Adam after he fathered Seth were 800 years; and he had other sons and daughters. Thus all the days that Adam lived were 930 years, and he died. When Seth had lived 105 years, he fathered Enosh. Seth lived after he fathered Enosh 807 years and had other sons and daughters. Thus all the days of Seth were 912 years, and he died. When Enosh had lived 90 years, he fathered Kenan. Enosh lived after he fathered Kenan 815 years and had other sons and daughters. Thus all the days of Enosh were 905 years, and he died. When Kenan had lived 70 years, he fathered Mahalalel. Kenan lived after he fathered Mahalalel 840 years and had other sons and daughters. Thus all the days of Kenan were 910 years, and he died. When Mahalalel had lived 65 years, he fathered Jared. Mahalalel lived after he fathered Jared 830 years and had other sons and daughters. Thus all the days of Mahalalel were 895 years, and he died. When Jared had lived 162 years, he fathered Enoch. Jared lived after he fathered Enoch 800 years and had other sons and daughters. Thus all the days of Jared were 962 years, and he died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Genealogy in Matthew begins identical to Genesis 5:1 and Jesus’ genealogy in Luke is identical to Genesis 5 (Luke goes in descending order)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 1:1 (KJV) The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luk 3:36-38 the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan, the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition regarding Adam says he died in Jerusalem and was buried on Mt. Moriah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-521-24-mysterious-enoch&#34;&gt;Genesis 5:21-24 Mysterious Enoch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Enoch had lived 65 years, he fathered Methuselah. Enoch walked with God after he fathered Methuselah 300 years and had other sons and daughters. Thus all the days of Enoch were 365 years. Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Genesis 5, Enoch is only mentioned one other time in the Hebrew Bible (1 Chr 1:3 as part of a Genealogy), but by virtue of his mysterious ending, he is the subject of a large body of work in Jewish mysticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He might be largely forgotten about by Christians were it not for two mentions, one in Hebrews and one in Jude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heb 11:5-6 By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God. [6] And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Septuagint uses the Greek word for “pleasing” in Genesis 5:24 where it says “walked with God.” In greek the thought is “Enoch was pleasing to God.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does the Book of Revelation bear a striking resemblance to the book of 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Enoch, Jude directly quotes from 1 Enoch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jud 1:14-16 It was also about these that Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, “Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his holy ones, to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all their deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him” (quoting 1 Enoch 1:9). These are grumblers, malcontents, following their own sinful desires; they are loud-mouthed boasters, showing favoritism to gain advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early believers expected Enoch and Elijah to return prior to the second coming of the Messiah.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early church father Tertullian wrote, “Enoch was translated and so was Elijah. They did not experience death; it was postponed, and only temporarily. They are most certainly preserved for the purpose of suffering of death so that, by their blood, they may extinguish Antichrist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Tertullian and others suggest that Enoch and Elijah are the two witnesses of Revelation 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 11:3-5 And I will grant authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.” These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth. And if anyone would harm them, fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes. If anyone would harm them, this is how he is doomed to be killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish Midrash states that Enoch was a shoemaker (perhaps because of all the walking with God he did).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the evil world around him, Enoch stitched each shoe with care and perfection in order to give his customers pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, “his main motivation was to help others rather than merely to sell shoes for a living.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that his heart was 100% on God, but that did not detract from his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No matter how mundane one’s vocation may be, it can be elevated by keeping in mind that one is helping others.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-525-32-enoch-to-noah&#34;&gt;Genesis 5:25-32 Enoch to Noah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Methuselah had lived 187 years, he fathered Lamech. Methuselah lived after he fathered Lamech 782 years and had other sons and daughters. Thus all the days of Methuselah were 969 years, and he died. When Lamech had lived 182 years, he fathered a son and called his name Noah, saying, “Out of the ground that the LORD has cursed, this one shall bring us relief from our work and from the painful toil of our hands.” Lamech lived after he fathered Noah 595 years and had other sons and daughters. Thus all the days of Lamech were 777 years, and he died. After Noah was 500 years old, Noah fathered Shem, Ham, and Japheth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, they knew Noah was going to be a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A boat captain wasn’t on their radar, so they naturally assumed he might be the messiah who will set things straight and remove the curse of painful toil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methuselah had the longest recorded life of anyone in the Bible – 969 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His name means “his death sends” or “his death brings” – Mot is death and selach means to send.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we do the math, we see the Flood came in the very year Methuselah died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus his name is a prophecy – his death shall bring the judgment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that he has the longest life also suggests God’s mercy –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Pe 3:9 The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grace – getting what you don’t deserve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercy – not getting what you DO deserve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we shall see in chapter 6, God’s mercy does not last indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gospel-message-in-hebrew&#34;&gt;The Gospel Message in Hebrew&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>Nativity Part I - Matthew 1:18-25</title>

&lt;p&gt;In NATIVITY focuses exlusively on Joseph.  He is fully prepared to do the thing expected of a Tzadik who has been wronged - seek no shame or revenge, but divorce her quietly.  Through this painful process, Joseph learns a lesson about how the light of Messiah can shine unexpectedly out of personal disappointments.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luke 2:1-38 (coming soon!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;matthew-118-19-marys-condition-and-josephs-dilemma&#34;&gt;Matthew 1:18-19 Mary&amp;rsquo;s Condition and Joseph&amp;rsquo;s Dilemma&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;th&gt;Matthew 1:18&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Heb 7:26&lt;/sup&gt; For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen 3:15&lt;/sup&gt; I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until now, miraculous births in the Bible still required a male/female union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek traditions (as well as Genesis 6) speak of gods impregnating women but nothing about the text indicates Mary’s conception was in any way sexual.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God spoke the universe into existence. He created Eve from Adam’s rib.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He could have achieved Mary’s pregnancy by speaking it or any number of other “contactless” ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a minimum, The Virgin Birth removes the stain of sin (often called original sin) that occurs whenever a human x and human y chromosome merge. Hebrews 7 reminds us that Jesus is “holy, innocent, unstained and separated from sinners.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tidbit about the Virgin Birth. In Genesis 3:15 God says to the serpent, “I will put enmity between your seed and HER seed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “seed of the woman” is one of the many names of the Jewish Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a seemingly biological contradiction. The seed is in the man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way back in Genesis, many scholars believe we have a hint of the virgin birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wells and Caves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:3.29028in;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eastern tradition (Greek, Russian orthodox, etc.) holds that the annunciation occurred at this well, in keeping with the rich tradition of momentous events happening at wells or springs throughout scripture. Abraham, Jacob, Gideon, and even Jesus in John 4 has the famous meeting with the Samaritan woman at the well.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western (Roman Catholic) tradition holds that the annunciation was in a cave that today is venerated at the Catholic Church of the Annunciation in Nazareth.
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:3.29028in;float:right&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caves are also prominent in the Bible with Abraham purchasing the cave at Machpelah in Hebron as a burial place, David establishing his superiority over Saul in a cave (though he later regretted it), Elijah, before he killed the priests of Baal, he found them hiding in caves,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John the Baptist traditionally lived in caves, and it is widely believed that both the birth of Jesus and the events described in the Garden of Gethsemane both took place in caves. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col style=&#34;width: 50%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&#34;width: 50%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;large&gt;Matthew 1:19&lt;/large&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;And her husband Joseph, &lt;u&gt;being a just man&lt;/u&gt; and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tzadik – &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;צַדִּיק&lt;/span&gt; – righteous one; not sinless but in the sense of Michah 6:8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Micah 6:8&lt;/sup&gt; He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you? but to do justice, and to love kindness (mercy), and to walk humbly with your God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Deu 22:23-24&lt;/sup&gt; “If there is a betrothed virgin, and a man meets her in the city and lies with her, then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones, the young woman because she did not cry for help though she was in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbor&#39;s wife. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mat 5:32&lt;/sup&gt; But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rom 12:7&lt;/sup&gt; Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as the Spirit wanted us to know that Zechariah was righteous, He wants us to know that Joseph was righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the Hebrew word for a righteous one is tzadik. Abraham was a tzadik, Boaz was a Tsadik and here Joseph is a Tzadik&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you read proverbs and it says the righteous do such and such but the wicked do such and such, the word for righteous is almost always tsadik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be a tzadik does not require sinless perfection, but it essentially means the person is living out Deuteronomy 6:5, love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, might and Leviticus 19:18 Love your neighbor as yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these are restated in Micah 6:8, He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you? but to do justice, and to love kindness (mercy), and to walk humbly with your God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus gives us all the power to be tzadikim (pl), just like Joseph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we weren’t acting like a tsaddik yesterday, today is a new day in the Lord who makes each of us a new creation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling Joseph a Tzadik rules out Joseph being the biological father (at least not in the usual sense – see speculation below); a just man wouldn’t have had relations before marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The angelic visitation is confirmation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph did have a decision to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Joseph&amp;rsquo;s No Good Options&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike today, the engaged couple entered into a marriage covenant upon the announcement of the betrothal (today we only enter into such a contract after the wedding ceremony).
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:4.41111in;float:right&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract is called a Ketubah and today at Jewish weddings, they are often done as beautiful artwork such as the one pictured.[^6]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To break an agreement of betrothal required a legal divorce&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources indicate divorce in this situation was REQUIRED (if the child was not his)[^7]; Jesus even affirms that divorce is appropriate in the scenario of adultery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to the Mishna, adultery during a betrothal period was &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; serious than that done after the wedding.[^8]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph, as the injured party, had full control over what happened to Mary in terms of judicial punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1&lt;/strong&gt;: She could have been subject to the death penalty for adultery, which is death by stoning (Deuteronomy 22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that she was obviously pregnant probably would have been enough for such a conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way it worked, was the injured party (for example the next of kin in a murder case) would be the one to cast the first stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember this nugget when we get to John 8 and the woman caught in adultery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commentators are split on whether Mary had a chance to plead her case to Joseph or whether Joseph assumed what to him was obvious. They would not have been allowed to be alone together but this does not exclude a conversation between Mary and Joseph with another adult present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can infer that Joseph loved her. If they had discussed if any part of him wanted to believe her; this would make it nearly impossible for him to be the one to cause her death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although some of the reasons the Bible gives for the death penalty may sound harsh by our standards, in practice the death penalty was rarely carried out. The Mishna records the following: “Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says a Sanhedrin that executes a transgressor once in seventy years (is considered a bloodthirsty tribunal)”[^9]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on what we know about Joseph, he was very unlikely to consider this option, and Matthew confirms this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2&lt;/strong&gt;: public divorce followed by public shame followed by exile – she would not be welcome in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Honor and Shame” was very strong in the ancient world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have honor and shame too, but we get it backwards; we &lt;strong&gt;encourage&lt;/strong&gt; shame (Netflix, Reality TV) and &lt;strong&gt;discourage&lt;/strong&gt; honor. It’s supposed to be the other way around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She and her child would have to fend for themselves in a society that did not take kindly to single mothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tzadik doesn’t seek revenge or seek to cause harm to another, even when he is wronged; therefore, #2 is also an unlikely option for Joseph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 12:17 reminds us that we should never repay evil for evil. This is a verse we must consider carefully whenever we are considering a legal remedy in response to a financial or physical injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it wasn’t written in Romans yet, Joseph modeled this behavior. He took door #3, which was the only option left to him (so he thought).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 3&lt;/strong&gt;: “Divorce her quietly” likely means Joseph was prepared to pay the fee to the father of the bride to break the engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is somewhat like a legal settlement where neither side admits any wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph is not going to press the issue of infidelity, and in so doing, HE would not directly bring any shame on Mary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, her condition would eventually be obvious and Mary would suffer the consequences of her actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without an accuser, there would be no judicial punishment, but she and her newborn would likely have been exiled from the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 4?&lt;/strong&gt;: As we mentioned above, the one thing he did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have the option to do was to marry her. At least not prior to verse 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law forbade it, so he would be sinning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing so would be an admission that He fathered the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such an admission would be (and as best we can tell, ultimately WAS) treated accordingly by the small, tight-night, and religiously observant community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes the sacrifice Joseph is about to make even MORE remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Since Joseph didn&amp;rsquo;t divorce Mary, why bother mentioning that he was thinking about it? Could there be a significant truth?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of being a disciple is asking questions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original &lt;em&gt;talmidim&lt;/em&gt; were frequently asking questions to make sure they understood what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Timothy 3:16-17 tells us that all scripture is profitable…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we read the text, we want to begin to question everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At various points, we want to ask, “why does the Spirit want me to know this?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically in this case, given that Joseph ultimately did NOT divorce Mary, why is it “profitable” for us to know that he was considering it even though he didn’t go through with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes all we can do is speculate, but as long as our loosely held theory doesn’t contradict Scripture or is refuted by historical facts we can continue to pursue it. We are very likely to learn something (or at least understand why our theory is false); either way, we grow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given what we discussed in the last lesson about the apparent extraordinary lengths God went to assure Jesus had the right credentials to be the Messiah, verse 19 potentially represents a momentary crisis point in the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had Satan enticed Joseph to follow through with the divorce, is it possible Jesus would have no connection or claim to the Royal line of David, and the whole messianic plan would have fallen apart?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put this another way, Jesus would have gone on to be the sinless Son of God with or without Joseph’s parenting. Why was Joseph’s NOT divorcing Mary worthy of mention?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can infer &lt;strong&gt;having Joseph involved must be extremely significant&lt;/strong&gt; somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence the very reasonable theory that the adoption by Joseph as the legal father is a required precondition to Jesus’ Messiahship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, with God&amp;rsquo;s plan momentarily in jeopardy, God must directly intervene once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;matthew-120-21-josephs-course-correction&#34;&gt;Matthew 1:20-21 Joseph&amp;rsquo;s Course Correction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;th&gt;Matthew 1:20&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.&#34;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is 51:7 “Listen to me, you who know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear not the reproach of man, nor be dismayed at their revilings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“conceived” = γεννάω, literally “begotten”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 49:5 And now the LORD says, he who formed me from the womb to be his servant…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given all we’ve discussed, the command to take Mary as his wife is staggering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angel reminded Joseph that he is a Son of David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joseph is not just in the bloodline of King David, he’s in the much more exclusive royal line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph then receives supernatural confirmation that Mary is not an adulteress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted previously, in any other circumstance, Joseph would be sinning if he married Mary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angel tells him that he’s not sinning by marrying her&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this introduces another problem. By proceeding with the wedding, Joseph was communicating that the child was his &lt;em&gt;and that he had acted less than honorably before marriage. No one at the time was going to believe their story about an immaculate conception&lt;/em&gt;. Not very many believe it today for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, we have a contradiction –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The baby’s not his, so he can’t marry her; he’s a tsadik and a tsadik doesn’t willfully break the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, he DOES marry her even though the baby’s not his (or is it?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster speculates that among the infinite number of ways God could have engineered the pregnancy, we can’t rule out that Joseph’s DNA was not &lt;em&gt;somehow, someway,&lt;/em&gt; a part of the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this is speculation, but such a move resolves any legal quandaries, namely the requirement for Joseph to divorce Mary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This move would also assure the royal Davidic line continued to be blood-based but would (again, somehow, some way) not have the stain of the curse.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, think about the ramifications for Joseph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us not overlook his sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph, Mary, and Jesus all had to live with the stigma of a crime they didn’t commit (and back then it was a crime) and for which the folks in a small town would have presumed their guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This perhaps adds new context to the angel’s encouragement to “do not fear”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 51:7 says “do not fear the reproach of men.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek word &lt;em&gt;genneas&lt;/em&gt; does not imply sexual conception;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is more along the lines of being miraculously formed in the womb as with Isaiah 49:5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more, it could be understood as miraculously placed in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nicene Creed attempts to deal with this by saying Jesus is “begotten not made, of one essence with the father by whom all things were made.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ Hebrew/Aramaic name is Yeshua, which means salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is wordplay, albeit highly significant wordplay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אֶת־שְׁמוֹ יֵשׁוּעַ כִּי הוּא יוֹשִׁיעַ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew likely meant “His people” denotatively (literally). His people were the Jewish people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jews are His natural born people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gentiles that are His are His by adoption (Romans 8:15, Galatians 4:5) and grafting (Romans 11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;matthew-122-23-jesus-fulfills-isaiah-714&#34;&gt;Matthew 1:22-23 Jesus Fulfills Isaiah 7:14&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: “Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel” (which means, God with us).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 7:13-&lt;/sup&gt;14 And he said, “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also? [14] Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1Pe 3:15&lt;/sup&gt; but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mat 28:20&lt;/sup&gt; And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew is using a literary device called &lt;em&gt;inclusio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inclusio&lt;/em&gt; is using the same or similar wording at both the beginning and the ending of a paragraph, passage, or in this case an entire book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we consider the genealogy a preamble, he’s essentially beginning his gospel with “God with us”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew ends his gospel with “I AM with you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the first of the statements on fulfilled prophecy cited by Matthew.
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:5.68403in;float:right&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The photo is from the “Great Isaiah Scroll” one of the Dead Sea scrolls which dates to the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; century BC that was discovered in 1947.  The bottom two lines are Isaiah 7:14.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;answering-common-challenges-to-matthew-123&#34;&gt;Answering Common Challenges to Matthew 1:23&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with more conservative theological beliefs would contend Matthew was inspired by the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Through this lens, we contend Matthew supernaturally saw that Isaiah’s prophecy regarding the birth of &lt;code&gt;Immanuel&lt;/code&gt; had messianic fulfillment by the virgin birth of Yeshua.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, theological conservatives have less of a problem taking Matthew (and indeed the entire Bible) at face value than do those with a more liberal Christian worldview or a non-Christian worldview.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-missionaries&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and other critics/skeptics often cite several problems with Matthew’s hermaneutical methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the most part, these arguments &lt;em&gt;do have some validity&lt;/em&gt;; therefore, we believe such exploration is a worthwhile exercise, even though those of us reading this commentary may be firm in our beliefs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is to our benefit to know and understand common so-called &amp;ldquo;problems&amp;rdquo; with the Bible to have a ready response if asked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Peter 3:15 tells us to be prepared to give every man an answer for the hope that is within us doing so with gentleness and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of discipleship is having that initial conversation with a non-believer, whether that person is a skeptic or has never heard Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are called to provide reasons, and sound, logical arguments, for the hope we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if not checked, seeds of doubt can grow into weeds that impede our own discipleship.  We must be absolutely confident that God&amp;rsquo;s word is true, and we must live like we are confident in it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chuck Missler used to say, &amp;ldquo;if you think you&amp;rsquo;ve found an error in the Bible, rejoice!  There are no errors in the Bible, and the journey you take to confirm that for yourself will result in a blessing.&amp;rdquo;  AMEN!&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times, such a defense may require us to provide refutations to arguments that attack the core fundamentals of the faith (in this case, the inerrancy of the Apostolic writings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of doing so with gentleness and respect, I would say rebutting an argument is ONLY worthwhile if the other person is making a legitimate academic inquiry and seeking an answer in good faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should not pick fights or try to win points in a social media discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending your time and energy answering someone who doesn’t really want to listen to you is an example of “casting your pearls before swine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, let’s look at some of the common challenges, and then we’ll provide some rebuttals and rationales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Challenge #1: Matthew takes the passages out of context. This passage in Isaiah was a sign given to King Ahaz about King Hezekiah’s birth (who many had hoped would be the messiah).&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Response: Yes, he does ignore the original context for the most part. In context, we agree the prophecy was given to King Ahaz 700 years before Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew follows Jewish methods of Scripture interpretation and application of his day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such methods leverage word-play, gematria, and hyper-literal application called &lt;em&gt;Midrash&lt;/em&gt; related to &lt;em&gt;drosh&lt;/em&gt;, to seek out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apostolic era midrash involves the transposition of a biblical text to a different application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no way my professors at Liberty University would let me get away with such methods of hermeneutics today, but they were common and accepted in the first century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many prophecies Matthew will cite have a dual application – one immediate to the time and another to the days of Messiah (and from a Christian perspective, this could either be the first coming or the second).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac Troki&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, one of the earliest published books that today’s anti-missionary groups rely on is called “Faith Strengthened” written in the mid 1500’s by Isaac Troki. Troki first documented most of the arguments we are discussing here in this section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troki is from the Karaite branch of Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an estimated 40,000 followers today (that is to say fairly small), Karaites break with most of traditional Judaism in rejecting the Oral Torah including the midrashic methods of interpretation used by almost every other branch of modern Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it’s easy for him to attack Matthew’s methods of Judaic interpretation because Troki himself didn’t agree with them according to his lens of Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also wouldn’t agree with the hermeneutic traditions of most other traditional Jewish sects, including the beliefs of those today who cite his book to attack Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Challenge #2: Matthew takes the passages &amp;lsquo;hyper-literally.&amp;rsquo; He&amp;rsquo;s reading things into the text that aren&amp;rsquo;t there.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-   Challenge: **He takes the passage hyper-literally.** Nothing about the passage implies a Virgin will still be a virgin when she conceives. It only requires that she be a virgin when the prophecy was given.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-   Response: Also true; but Matthew was also saying the most supernatural part of the prophecy remained unfulfilled in Ahaz’s day: the fact that the virgin will be a virgin when she conceives.

-   While the prophecy was most directly to King Ahaz (who lived 700 years before Jesus), Isaiah also said, “hear then, HOUSE OF DAVID…” – the prophecy can apply to the entire line; not just one man.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Challenge #3: The Hebrew word Matthew says means &lt;code&gt;virgin&lt;/code&gt; could also mean &lt;code&gt;a young woman&lt;/code&gt;, who is not necessarily a virgin.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Response: This complaint is more flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same people just got through arguing that the person need only be a virgin at the time the prophecy was written. For the woman to NOT be a virgin, would be a curse, not a prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six other times the word &lt;em&gt;alma&lt;/em&gt; is used in the Bible; most of the time it is unambiguously a virgin as we think of the word. The other couple of times, it could be ambiguous potentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not much of a sign when a young woman gets pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the nail in the coffin of this complaint is when the Jewish scholars translated the Hebrew Bible into the Greek Septuagint, they used the unambiguous Greek word for virgin, Parthenos, παρθένος&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, 200 years before the birth of Jesus, the Jewish sages believed Isaiah meant “virgin” as we think of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Challenge #4: Judaism never teaches a virgin birth. The Christian concept of the &lt;code&gt;Immaculate Conception&lt;/code&gt; is straight out of Greco-Roman paganism.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Response: as we noted at the beginning of this lesson, pagan conceptions between gods and virgin females were ALWAYS sexual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened to Mary was in NO WAY sexual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we acknowledge that two of the four gospels don’t mention the virgin birth and several apostolic writers including Paul never mentions it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-   An argument as to why this could be that they didn’t find it all that surprising because they knew Jewish tradition, which DOES in fact have several TRADITIONS and LEGENDS of supernatural conceptions and births.[^13]
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible recounts several “closed wombs” that were supernaturally opened by God, making all of those conceptions miraculous works of God. By definition, a virgin’s womb is closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not from the Bible, Jewish legend holds that Isaac, Moses, and David also were supernaturally conceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dead Sea Scrolls written around the time of Jesus contain a fragment of a legend that holds Noah was supernaturally conceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t saying these non-biblical legends are true, and that is not the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that a Jewish supernatural conception of a person God used mightily would have resonated with the early apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they may have initially had their doubts, once they heard the story as authenticated by Matthew and Luke (of whom we have no reason to believe they were being deceitful or delusional), the other Jewish apostles had no reason to doubt any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virgin birth has nothing to do with pagan mythology that anti-missionaries object to.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;matthew-124-25-josephs-revised-decision&#34;&gt;Matthew 1:24-25 Joseph&amp;rsquo;s Revised Decision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Matthew 1:24-25&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Reference&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mishnah Bava Batra 8:6, 134a&lt;/sup&gt; If one says: &amp;ldquo;This is my son,&amp;rdquo; he is believed, as regards the right of inheritance”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern notes, “Joseph’s behavior indicated that he accepted Yeshua as his son.” The Mishnah states, “he is to be believed; thus Yeshua, as a legally acknowledged son, is entitled to inherit the throne of King David from Joseph.” &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps this supports the speculation that (somehow, someway) Jesus WAS Joseph’s son.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a minimum, it appears Joseph married Mary &lt;strong&gt;immediately&lt;/strong&gt; to attempt to minimize her (and now their) shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By doing so, he also created the impression among the 200 or so other townsfolk of Nazareth that he faltered and fathered the child. They probably knew the timing didn’t line up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, to see both sides, there is another line of thought that says the folk in Nazareth, which means “branch town,” i.e., branch of David, believed the messiah would eventually come from their midst, so maybe the situation isn’t as dire as we might imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we go through the gospels, where it may be of value to our own discipleship, we will try to learn to critically question many of the standard conclusions made and passed down by commentators over the years to see if there might not be another equally plausible explanation for what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we will look for examples that allow us to exhibit Leviticus 19:18 better and give others the benefit of the doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, word got out, and Jesus’ detractors learned about Jesus’ seemingly inappropriate conception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several examples of ancient anti-Christian literature claim that Jesus resulted from an affair Mary had with a Roman soldier named Pantera (yes, children of the 80s, you heard that right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only have the one event from Jesus’ childhood where he visits the Temple, so nothing is recorded of any trauma or struggles in His childhood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 8, Psalm 69 and others might indicate the family was subjected to abuse because of the apparent scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew skips over the birth narrative with the shepherds, which we find in Luke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish boys were not named until the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day, at their circumcision&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another subtle hint that the Magi were not there the night of Jesus’ birth but came later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll spoil this and many other of your favorite Christmas traditions when we get to Luke 2!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anti-missionaries are traditional Jews who believe Christianity is a dangerous anti-Jewish cult and work to prevent, refute, and undo any Christian missionary efforts among Jews. “Jews for Jesus” is a messianic missionary group. “Jews for Judaism” is an anti-missionary group.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read/hear the portions&lt;/strong&gt;: Luke 2:1-38&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In NATIVITY part II, Joseph and Mary must travel to Bethlehem to take part in a census. Five miles from Jerusalem, Bethlehem serves as the birthplace of David and King Messiah. Close by at Migdal Eder, a group of shepherds is startled by an angel who announces the birth of the Messiah. The new family makes their first trip to the Temple in Jerusalem, where they encounter a holy man and a prophetess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Videos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 2:1-20: 
 &lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 2:21-38:

 &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geographic-setting&#34;&gt;Geographic Setting:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 2 is our first encounter where geography plays a significant supporting role in our understanding of the Gospels. In just about every remaining chapter in the Gospels, we will want to pause to understand the geographic background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.875in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This satellite photo shows two possible travel routes from Nazareth to Bethlehem&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The more direct route would take them through Samaria along the Way of the Patriarchs. In other words, this is the same road that Abraham and Jacob traveled frequently. It’s about 70 miles to Jerusalem going this way. While we’re often taught that Jews and Samaritans avoided each other at all costs, it was not unheard of for Jews to use this road. Luke doesn’t tell us which way they traveled, but we know Jesus traveled the shorter route on at least one occasion in John 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way around would take travelers from Galilee, through the Jezreel valley, around Mt. Gilboa, where they would follow the Jordan down to Jericho. At Jericho, they would hang a right to make the grueling climb along the Ascent of Adummim up to Jerusalem. The photo below shows the climb from 800-1200 feet below sea level at Jericho (depending on where you measure) to 2500 feet above at Jerusalem.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Going in this direction added an extra 20 miles to the journey and required fording the Jordan a couple of times. We know for sure Jesus traveled this way as He made His way up to Jerusalem for the final time of His earthly ministry after he met with Zacchaeus and Bartimaeus in Jericho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.875in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several examples Luke paints a very different picture of “the Christmas story” than many of us have grown up with. We call these &amp;ldquo;Christmyth Busters.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christmyth: A December birth for Jesus is unlikely.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One large problem with assuming a December birth is that the dirt roads would have been nearly impassable in early winter because of the snow, rain, and mud. If we assume they took the long route along the Jordan – ~90 miles, the Jordan river would have been swollen and the banks flooded. In short, it is unlikely that a roman administrator in his right mind would have conducted a census at this time of year (think of the alps in Italy and the mountains in Turkey). To be fair, not all Roman emperors were in their right minds although that charge has never been leveled against Augustus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned in &lt;strong&gt;Annunciations&lt;/strong&gt;, there is strong tradition to suggest John the Baptist was born in the spring, which means Jesus would have been borm six months later in the early fall.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luke 2:1-3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;In those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria. And all went to be registered, each to his own town.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Act 5:37&lt;/sup&gt; After him Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and drew away some of the people after him. He too perished, and all who followed him were scattered.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:40%;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Matthew gives us only a brief overview regarding Jesus&amp;rsquo; actual birth – remember his only mention was in Matthew 1:24; everything after that verse is AFTER his birth – Luke will give us a lot more detail. We said in Luke 1 that Luke’s intent is to give us an orderly account. Luke is focused on who Jesus was, so we’re going to get a lot of detail about the human side of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars and skeptics have a problem with Luke’s dating of the Quirinius census to AD 6, which would have been way too late to have occurred at the time of Jesus’ birth. King Herod died in 4 BC, so Jesus’ birth had to be before Herod’s death. The problem is we have no historical evidence of a census that occurred during the later stages of Herod’s life. We must remember that “absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.” This is the fallacy the skeptics are engaging in with their argument. They’re assuming Luke made an error, for which we similarly have no evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Bible itself, Acts 5:37 tells us that Luke knew exactly when the AD6 census was because he references it directly. Again this is one of those instances where the Narrative would have been just fine with “Judas the Galilean rose up and drew away some of the people” but the Holy Spirit adds “in the days of the census.” This, in my opinion, is the Holy Spirit anticipating the Quirinius question and letting us know that Luke was referencing a different census in Luke 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we don’t have any extrabiblical evidence to support a worldwide census around 5 BC, we do have some reasonable clues to suggest Luke is accurate. Of course, I and I presume most watching this video will start with our presupposition that the Bible is inerrant in its original manuscripts. We have no reason to doubt Luke, therefore we contend he’s telling the truth. To be fair, not every person (not even each who professes to be a Christian) has our presupposition; so, it doesn’t hurt to dig deeper to be educated on plausible explanations in case we are asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke mentions Caesar Augustus. Caesar Augustus (63 BC-AD 14) was the first Roman emperor. He reigned as emperor from 27 BC to AD 14.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; One theme of Luke is that in many places, he appears to be “pro-roman.” Centurions are often the “good guys” in Luke’s narrative. In Acts, Luke is careful to say it’s not the Romans causing trouble, but the religious establishment. This gives support to the speculation that Luke wrote Luke and Acts as affidavits for Paul’s trial at Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an executive, Augustus was among the greatest of all the emperors. Although there are no records of him ever ordering a worldwide census, it is not unlikely that he did. We presume this census must have served a needed function in the administration of the Roman Empire. In God’s providence, it was used to bring Joseph and Mary from Nazareth to Bethlehem in order to fulfill the prophecy of the Messiah’s birth in Micah 5:2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:3.95694in;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, archaeology may help us resolve the conundrum. This tombstone doesn’t mention Quirinius by name but it mentions someone who was TWICE legate of Syria and Phoenicia during the time of Augustus.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This presents a couple of reasonable explanations. 1. Quirinus conducted at least two censuses: one in AD 6 for which we have extrabiblical confirmation, and one at the time of Jesus for which we do not. 2. Formen suggests Quirinius may have &lt;em&gt;completed&lt;/em&gt; a census in AD 6 that was started much earlier.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 3. The Greek word “proto” can mean first, but it can also mean before. A prototype is an early model before the final version. This could be the census BEFORE Quirinius. Critics and skeptics like to point to apparent discrepancies in an attempt to cast doubt on the text, but usually all it takes is a little digging to develop alternate plausible theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect that would be good for us to be more comfortable with is certain tensions in the biblical text. They are nothing to be afraid of. When the Jewish sages encountered such matters in the Hebrew Bible, they often write “this is a difficulty,” then go on to postulate on what may be going on. Often there is not agreement between sages on how to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Lencioni wrote a business book called the “five dysfunctions of a team.” A fear of conflict and artificial harmony is one of those disfunctions. Lencioni says that open, candid dialogue and constructive conflict is how teams grow; and I would add it’s how disciples grow too. We don’t fully grow by being spoon-fed a bunch of facts. We grow by challenging and being challenged by the text so that we resolve all conflicts as best we can, and in so doing we thoroughly own and understand the text and make it our own. Discipleship is not always comfortable (ask Peter); following Jesus is not a spectator sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image5.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:1.51389in; float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For forty-five years continuously, I have devoted myself to one great study of the Old Testament, in all of its languages, in all of its archaeology in all of its translations. The critics of the Bible who go to in order to find fault claim themselves as all knowledge, all virtue, all love of the truth&amp;hellip;I can affirm that there is not a page of the Old Testament concerning which you need have any doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert D. Wilson, Ph.D (1856-1930).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would add that the New Testament is equally reliable. Whenever you think you’ve found an error, rejoice. There are no errors. What follows will likely be an exciting journey into deeper understanding that draws you closer to the Author of the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luke 2:4-5&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the “Genealogies” lesson, we discussed the theory that Matthew presents Jesus’ line through Joseph and Luke presents His line through Mary. This enables Jesus also to be of the “house” and “Lineage” of David but without the curse on the bloodline documented in Jeconiah 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/luke2-4-jezreel.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned earlier, it was common for Jews in Galilee who were traveling to Jerusalem to bypass Samaria by traveling south through the Jordan Rift. Luke 17:11 mentions that Jesus traveled between Samaria and Galilee on His way to Jerusalem. Mount Gilboa is the northernmost of the mountains of Samaria. Joseph and Mary may have skirted these mountains by passing past Jezreel and through the Harod Valley.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This is one of my more favorite locations in Israel. I have many favorite locations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christmyth: No mention of a Donkey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our next Christmyth buster, neither Luke nor Matthew indicates they made the journey on a donkey or any other animal. In fact, this is unlikely as only the wealthy could afford an animal for travel. We know from the offering they made to redeem Mary’s purification at the temple, that they were poor. See comment at verse 22.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luke 2:6&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christmyth: Jesus was not born immediately after Mary arrived in Bethlehem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were in Bethlehem for some undetermined amount of time before Mary’s delivery. They did not come into town late at night with a medical emergency only to be met with doors slammed in their faces.  They had plenty of time to find suitable lodging.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luke 2:7&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn (guesthouse).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christmyth: our conceptions about “no room at the inn” are all wrong.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image8.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:50%;float:right&#34; /&gt;We often imagine Mary being rejected by a grumpy innkeeper at the exact moment of an impending medical emergency and all they could find was some stinky animal feeding trough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Luke is clear that Jesus’ birth was unusual, this isn’t quite what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No room at the Inn” is an extremely poor translation. There was no room at the &lt;em&gt;katalyma&lt;/em&gt;, which is a guest room that is part of a private dwelling. Luke uses a different word for a commercial innkeeper – &lt;em&gt;pandocheion&lt;/em&gt; in Luke 10:34 and the Good Samaritan story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a more logical explanation: a &lt;em&gt;katalyma&lt;/em&gt; is simply not an appropriate place for a birth. Guest rooms were likely full because of the census so they were likely sharing sleeping space. A birth is an intimate moment for the family and quite likely Mary made some screams (I don’t think they had epidurals back then), both of which make it uncomfortable and awkward to have others around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no question, however, that Jesus’ entry into the world was humble and lowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they often did do was build their houses so that the basement (if I could use that term) was a cave. They would build the upper levels of the house on top. The custom in that day is that’s where they would keep the livestock. That sounds foreign to us, but that’s what they did. That’s what the picture above is showing (although we’re pretty sure Mary did not have the incandescent light bulb to light her way).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christmyth: Jesus was not born in a stable.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image9.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:35%;float:right&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“(The evidence) suggests Jesus was born in the main quarters of a house which…may have incorporated a cave into its living space.”[^7]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This illustration was drawn in the 1880s and provides another illustration for what the scene might have looked like if Mary gave birth to Jesus in a room in the house where animals were kept.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-cave-tradition&#34;&gt;The Cave tradition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early church tradition places Jesus birth in a cave. One fact about history is the next occupying force was tended not to respect previous folk’s holy places. The fact that the people were able to be conquered was taken as a sign that their gods were weak. In approximately 135, the wicked Emperor Hadrian (yes the same guy with the wall in England) thought he would stamp out Judaism and this weird offshoot that came to be called Christianity by converting all of their holy places to pagan roman shrines. He did this with the Temple and the church of Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem and he did this with a certain Cave in Bethlehem. In other words, he wouldn’t have tried to erase these locations if they weren’t significant; it shows these sites were revered long before Hadrian came along. So far from erasing this history, he actually marked and preserved these locations for posterity. Thank you Hadrian!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;luke-28-15-the-shepherds&#34;&gt;Luke 2:8-15 The Shepherds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luke 2:8-12&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And in the same region, there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.  And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear.  And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.  For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Messiah the Lord. And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.” &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image10.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.30833in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here and verse 15 we know that the shepherds were some distance away from Bethlehem&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words they could not have been there at the moment of Jesus’ birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another strike against a December birth is that it probably would have been far too cold to keep flocks out by night. In fact, it suggests the opposite. When it was warmer, the sheep would pasture by night; when it was cooler, they pasture during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern notes, “shepherding was and is a despised occupation in the Middle East,” and stands in stark contrast with the Magi of Matthew 2, who were at the opposite end of the social scale. “Both came to honor the messiah (because he is the) Messiah of high and low alike.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is already the third “fear not” in Luke (to Zechariah, Mary, and now the Shepherds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image11.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:4.89068in;height:3.5in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“City of David” is a term that is used interchanably for Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Both cities claim King David the way both Abilene, Kansas and Dennison Texas claim Eisenhower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember Yeshua is connected for the words for salvation and savior. In Luke 1:47 Mary’s “spirit rejoices in God (her) Savior.” Here it is clear that the Savior is the Messiah, Yeshua and therefore Messiah = God of Israel. This is one of the dots that Luke is connecting for us gentiles. Think of this the next time you ask whether someone is “saved”? You are REALLY asking “Are you Jesus’d?” Do you have joy in being Jesus’d? Do people look at you and say “he or she is Jesus’d!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Christ” is not His last name. It is His title in Greek. His title in Hebrew is “Messiah” – Jesus the Messiah and Jesus Christ both mean the same thing. Since He ministered to a Jewish culture, we encourage saying Jesus the Messiah. If you’re slightly more daring, you can even call him Yeshua HaMashiach! On a related note some people have websites telling others that Jesus is a pagan name related to Zeus. This is internet folklore. Yeshua to Ieasus to Jesus is a logical progression from Hebrew/Aramaic to Greek/Latin to English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luke 2:13-15&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!” When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 14 is known as the &lt;em&gt;Gloria&lt;/em&gt;, which is short for &lt;em&gt;Gloria in Excelsis Deo et in terra pax homínibus bonae voluntátis.&lt;/em&gt; In Latin or English, Luke 2:14 is a prominent fixture in both Catholic and Protestant liturgies, as well as a U2 single from 1981.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earthly choirs honored the emperor, and the current emperor Agustus is known for instituting the famous &lt;em&gt;pax romana.&lt;/em&gt; Luke is certainly contrasting the worldly king with all his pomp and circumstance with the true king in a lowly manger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image12.png&#34; style=&#34;width:5.12855in;height:4.70935in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shepherds travelled some unstated distance to Bethlehem. Bolen: The traditional location of Shepherds’ Fields to the east of the village of Bethlehem is logical because sheep would graze beyond the area cultivated by farmers. As one goes to the east, the amount of rainfall quickly drops off, making it unproductive for agriculture.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen 37:11&lt;/sup&gt; And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener notes, “Bethlehem was not a large town. The shepherds probably checked the animal stables one by one until they found the one with the baby.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christmyth: Jesus was not univerally rejected at His Birth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the Christmyth that Jesus entered the world rejected and despised, the evidence suggests the opposite. His birth was heralded by the highest angels and praised by lowest shepherds. He was welcomed and celebrated. Next, we’ll see how Jesus was praised in the temple by a devout priest and a humble prophetess. Luke will end the chapter by saying “And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man” (Luke 2:52).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;And at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Luk 1:59&lt;/sup&gt; And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child. And they would have called him Zechariah after his father…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mat 1:25&lt;/sup&gt; And he called his name Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image13.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:35%;float:right&#34; /&gt;As we reviewed at the end of Matthew 1, circumcisions were on the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day as specified in the Torah, and this is when the newborn child was named. Luke 2:21 corresponds with Matthew 1:25. Note the shepherds&amp;rsquo; story comes BEFORE Luke 2:21 and the Magi story comes AFTER Matthew 1:25. Our next Christmyth buster is that the Magi were not there with the shepherds, but came after, apparently as late as two years after, Jesus’ birth. We’ll unpack this more in the next lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;And when the time came for their purification according to the Law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, “Every male who first opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord”) and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord, “a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Exo 13:2&lt;/sup&gt; “Consecrate to me all the firstborn. Whatever is the first to open the womb among the people of Israel, both of man and of beast, is mine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Lev 12:2-4, 8&lt;/sup&gt; “Speak to the people of Israel, saying, If a woman conceives and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean seven days. As at the time of her menstruation, she shall be unclean. [3] And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. [4] Then she shall continue for thirty-three days in the blood of her purifying. She shall not touch anything holy, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying are completed. (8) And if she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves or two pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a purification offering. And the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Num 18:16&lt;/sup&gt; And their redemption price (at a month old you shall redeem them) you shall fix at five shekels in silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ parents fulfill the Jewish Law properly. Jesus had to perfectly keep the law in order to be the Messiah. Even when He is physically unable to do so by His own means, his parents do what is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two different rituals going on here at the same time: the offering of the firstborn and the required ritual purification of a mother after she gives birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering for the firstborn was done after the 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day (traditionally the 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; day), while the purification was done after 40 days. They either did both at the same time or stayed in Jerusalem between the 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; and 41&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; days. If Luke is being fully precise in his chronology, it appears that both offerings may have been on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the text mentions both, it’s curious that the recorded offering in verses 22-24 deals ONLY with the purification procedure, not the firstborn redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;purification-of-mary&#34;&gt;Purification of Mary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While giving birth is not a sin, according to the Torah, it rendered a woman in an unclean state. Being unclean is a temporary status and is not the same as sinning. Many times, an unclean status was not avoidable. Mary and Joseph followed the required offering to purify Mary from her unclean status. Offering two pigeons or two turledoves the provision for those who couldn’t afford a lamb, according to Leviticus 12:1-8. This indicates they were poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;redemption-of-the-firstborn-son&#34;&gt;Redemption of the Firstborn Son&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The redemption of the firstborn is directly tied to the Levitical priesthood. The father typically handed the baby boy to a priest, and say, “This is my firstborn son, and the Holy One, blessed be He, has commanded me to redeem him.” The priest then says, “Which do you prefer, to give away your firstborn son to me, or to redeem him for five shekels as you are required by the Torah?” The father then typically replies, “I wish to redeem my son; I present you with the cost of his redemption.” The father pays, then the priest takes the child in his arms, blesses him, then hands the child back to the father.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s reasonable to conclude Joseph paid the five shekels (or some equivalent provision for the poor), but Luke doesn’t mention this. Another way to look at it is that the Holy Spirit edited that out. During the Genealogies lessons, we learned we want to ask “why” whenever the Holy Spirit includes a seemingly unnecessary detail. Here we need to ask the same question when the Holy Spirit omits a seemingly critical detail. When we dig a little we are rewarded with insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;More &amp;lsquo;Holy Spirit editing&amp;rsquo; in Genesis 22&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The classic example of an obvious &amp;ldquo;omission&amp;rdquo; that results in a deeper spiritual point is Genesis 22:19 &lt;em&gt;So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham lived at Beersheba&lt;/em&gt;. This is immediately after the Angel stopped Abraham from sacrificing Isaac. After the promise given to Abraham in verses 16-18, it’s reasonable to conclude that BOTH Abraham AND ISAAC, descended the mountain and return to Abraham’s young men who were watching the donkeys in 22:5. But Isaac is not mentioned here. He is not mentioned again until after being united with Rebekah in Gen 24:62. If we think in types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abraham is a type of the Father who sacrificed His Son.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaac is a type of Jesus who “disappears” after being “sacrificed.” He remains “hidden” until he is united with His bride. It gets better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rebekah is that gentile bride who agrees to be wed to a groom she has never seen.  She is a type of the Church.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of this is orchestrated by a servant whose name means God’s Helper. The servant is a type of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have the Father, Son, Spirit, and gentile church all in view in Genesis 22 and 24. The typology doesn’t work unless Isaac is somehow edited out of the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Luke’s case, if we look ahead to the end of the story, there are any number of reasonable applications as to why the five shekels “wasn’t paid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus lived His life in service of God, just as if He had been handed to the temple priest for lifetime service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus WILL pay the price to be the “Firstborn of All creation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is the one who will redeem us; He is not the One who needs to be redeemed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is a priest in the order of Melchizedek, not Levi. Heb 7:11 Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, rather than one named after the order of Aaron?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luke 2:25-28&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Christ. And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the Law, he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Act 1:6&lt;/sup&gt; So when they had come together, they asked him, “Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another facet that is logical but isn’t obvious is that according to verse 27, Simeon was the priest officiating the firstborn ceremony. The Holy Family had entered the court of Women in the Temple looking for a priest to officiate. At the same time, Simeon’s eyes were drawn to the family and made himself available for service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is another Jewish person described by Luke as righteous and devout. He also has the Holy Spirit upon him. Here is another Jew who lived in expectation of the coming of Messiah and recognized Him when He arrived. We all should be seeing how the actual words of the Bible are often in conflict with popular New Testament theology concerning the Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll come back to Acts 1:6 when we meet Anna, the prophetess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;oracle-6---nunc-dimittis&#34;&gt;Oracle #6 - Nunc Dimittis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace, according to your word; for my eyes have seen your salvation that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel.” And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen 46:30&lt;/sup&gt; Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me die, since I have seen your face and know that you are still alive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Psa 119:65 Teth&lt;/sup&gt; You have dealt well with your servant, O LORD, according to your word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Psa 119:41 Waw&lt;/sup&gt; Let your steadfast love come to me, O LORD, your salvation according to your promise;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen 49:18&lt;/sup&gt; I wait for your salvation, O LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 52:10&lt;/sup&gt; The LORD has bared his holy arm before the eyes of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Psa 98:2&lt;/sup&gt; The LORD has made known his salvation; he has revealed his righteousness in the sight of the nations (Gentiles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 42:6&lt;/sup&gt; “I am the LORD; I have called you in righteousness; I will take you by the hand and keep you; I will give you as a covenant for the people, a light for the nations (gentiles),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 46:13&lt;/sup&gt; I bring near my righteousness; it is not far off, and my salvation will not delay; I will put salvation in Zion, for Israel my glory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 2 has the last two of the seven oracles. We looked at the first five in Luke 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annunciation of John - 1:13-17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annunciation of Jesus to Mary - 1:30:37&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blessings of Elizabeth - 1:42-45&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Magnificat - 1:46-55&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Benedictus - 1:68-80&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nunc Dimittis 2:29:32&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary’s Sword - 2:34-25&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars believe the Nunc Dimittis became a part of early church liturgy along with the Magnificat and Benedictus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we see the deliberate pun on salvation and Yeshua. Simeon also revealed that Gentiles were included in the Messianic plan. In this respect, Simeon is possibly a foreshadow of Simon Peter, who, after some convincing, also proclaimed this message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are at least eight references to the Hebrew Bible in this short oracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;oracle-7--marys-sword&#34;&gt;Oracle #7 – Mary’s Sword&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col style=&#34;width: 50%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&#34;width: 50%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luke 2:34-35&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, “Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Num 6:24&lt;/sup&gt; The LORD bless you and keep you;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 8:14-15&lt;/sup&gt; And he will become a sanctuary and a stone of offense and a rock of stumbling to both houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And many shall stumble on it. They shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and taken.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mar 12:10&lt;/sup&gt; Have you not read this Scripture: “‘The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rom 9:33&lt;/sup&gt; as it is written, “Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense; and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blessing in verse 34 is likely the &lt;em&gt;v’arevecha&lt;/em&gt;, the priestly benediction, from Numbers 6. We’re speculating but as this is directed to Mary, potentially, Simeon handed Jesus to Mary instead of Joseph as he spoke these words. This would have been unusual (the baby was supposed to be handed back to the father according to tradition) but this could be a hint that Simeon knew that Joseph was not the father in the usual sense and/or b) giving Jesus to Mary would have underscored the severity of Simeon’s words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After six oracles promising joy and salvation, this seventh turns dark and unsettling.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is the first indication of pain in the Gospel story. Simeon prophecies the division Messiah will cause, leading to His death. Israel’s rejection of Messiah will be nearly overwhelming for Mary. A “sword piercing a soul” is a Talmudic idiom for “wish I were dead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luke 2:36-38&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years from when she was a virgin, and then as a widow until she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day. And coming up at that very hour she began to give thanks to God and to speak of him to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Act 5:42&lt;/sup&gt; And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and preaching that the Messiah is Jesus.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t sure why, but Luke doesn’t record what she said. First, it’s interesting that Luke notes she is from the tribe of Asher. Asher was one of the ten northern tribes that was taken into captivity by the Assyrians in 721 BC. This has led to the so-called “ten lost tribes” myth. Apparently Anna was not lost. When we get to Revelation and the sealing of the 144,000, some wonder how we can take the “12,000” from each of the 12 tribes literally if ten of the tribes are supposedly lost. Luke is telling us that God knows exactly where His people are. If you’re feeling distant from God, God is not the one who moved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anna or channa in Hebrew, means “grace” or “favor,” so whatever she said likely provided some comfort after Simeon’s dark predictions. She was married for seven years, then became a widow. Rather than remarry, she elected to devote her remaining years to the service of the Lord. Her devotion foreshadows the earlier Jewish believers who will meet in the Temple every day to proclaim Jesus after His Ascension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that Simeon, Anna and the Jewish apostles in Acts 1:6 who were expecting Jesus to redeem Israel and Jerusalem weren’t wrong. When we get to Acts 1, we are often taught by well-intended teachers something along the lines of, “those dense apostles. Even after all Jesus taught, they STILL didn’t understand how wrong they were. Once again, Jesus has to set them straight.” As we will be fond of pointing out, Acts 1:7 and 1:8 does not support any type of correction or rebuke. In fact, Jesus doesn’t even disagree with the assumptions behind their question. He merely says, “It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.” (Acts 1:7-8). The Redemption Simeon and Anna were waiting for will happen, but it will be on God’s timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, in Luke’s narrative, the Holy Family returns to Nazareth. Matthew records that they had some other adventures first. We’ll look at those in the next lesson called “the Nazarene.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In THE NAZARENE, Joseph and Mary return to the remote village of Nazareth overlooking the Jezreel Valley and Mount Tabor. The transition from cosmopolitan Alexandria to backwater Nazareth allows them to live out their own personal exodus from Egypt. Every year at Passover, the family joins other Galileans to make the pilgrimage to Jerusalem for the festival. Twelve-year-old Yeshua is reluctant to leave His Father’s house in the holy city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:75%; float:right&#34; /&gt;Matthew’s narrative includes the visit of the Magi from the “east” – scholars think it’s either Parthia/Persia or Arabia. In general, the Euphrates separated the Parthian from the Roman empire. Frankincense and Myrrh are associated more with Arabia, but this doesn’t mean the Magi had to come from Arabia, although they certainly could have. We’re going to see that Herod and all Jerusalem was in an uproar, which to some suggests Herod may have thought a Parthian invasion was imminent. (Three guys on camels would not cause an uproar, but we’ll bust that Christ myth a bit later!). After the Magi’s visit, the Holy Family flees to Egypt. We aren’t told where, but Alexandria is a fair assumption because of the significant Jewish population there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.png&#34; style=&#34;width:60%; float:right&#34; /&gt;In a sense the whole bible is about usurpers, starting back in Genesis 3 with the serpent tricking man into thinking that our way is better than God’s way. That deception still continues, not only in the geopolitical world around us but also within us individually. Herod is the phony king of the Jews who isn’t even Jewish, while Jesus is the rightful one who is BORN king of the Jews. Herod represents darkness while Jesus represents light. At this point in Matthew 2, the evil king is hunting down Yeshua, who must relocate to safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe Old Testament Joseph traveled along the Via Maris, the way of the sea, while Jacob and his family traveled along the way of the Patriarchs to Beersheba and then on down to Egypt. Given that Bethlehem lies along the way of the patriarchs, it’s reasonable to suspect the Holy Family used the same road as Jacob when they fled to Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Magi are said to depart from Bethlehem a different way, which is to say they did not go back through Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herod died in 4 BC. After the sojourn in Egypt, the text appears their first choice would have been to go back to Bethlehem however the political situation – and the holy spirit – directed them back to Nazareth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archelaus, who was now over Judea and Samaria (including Jerusalem) was every bit as ruthless as his father Herod was. He was so awful that Rome replaced him in AD 6 with the procurators. The procurator we know best is Pontius Pilate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archelaus’ brother Antipas was over Galilee and Perea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Matthew 2, whenever we read “Herod” or “Herod the Tetrarch” without further designation, that is referring to Herod Antipas. Antipas is the Herod at the end of Jesus’ life who asks for a miracle. When Jesus stays silent (Refusing to acknowledge his authority), Antipas mocks him and sends him back to Pilate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, “Where is he who has been born king of the &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt;? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Num 24:17&lt;/sup&gt; I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near: a star shall come out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel; it shall crush the forehead of Moab and break down all the sons of Sheth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen 3:15&lt;/sup&gt; I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 2:6&lt;/sup&gt; For you have rejected your people, the house of Jacob, because they are full of things from the east&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magi were gentile/ pagan astrologers whose divinatory skills were widely respected in the Greco-Roman world; astrology had become popular through the “science” of the East. According to Keener, “everyone agreed that the best astrologers lived in the East.” Isaiah acknowledges this in Isa 2:6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have mentioned, there is a possible dig at Herod when they ask, “where is He that is BORN king of the Jews?”. Herod was appointed by Rome. They could be saying “where is the REAL king?” Even if they didn’t mean it as an insult, it is likely Herod took it as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That messiah would be signified by a star goes back to Numbers 24 and a prophecy by Balaam, also a gentile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Matthew’s points is that gentiles who would otherwise have no interest in a Jewish messiah make the trek across the lands to come bow to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Him, while in verse 5, the religious who should worship the messiah do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we move through the Gospels, we’ll encounter a terminology problem with the word translated as “Jews” in our Bibles. For us 2000 years later, it can be difficult without additional context. Sometimes the Jews are all Jewish people in the first century and other times they are a specific subset, such as the corrupt political elite. Some speculate it would only take as few as 20 or 30 people to engineer the plot to arrest and kill Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use “Americans” the same way, but we usually understand the meaning from the context. “The Americans invaded Afghanistan” versus “Americans have specific rights outlined in the constitution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remind us that we need to ask ourselves this question and not immediately assume all Jews, I will use the Greek term &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt;. In this context in Matthew 2, &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; means all Jews. In the next lesson, we will see that this term refers to a very small subset of temple-establishment types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 2:3-4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, &lt;strong&gt;and all Jerusalem with him&lt;/strong&gt;; and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:60%; float:right&#34; /&gt;As we said earlier, it could have been a threat of military incursion from Parthia or it could simply be a situation of “if Herod isn’t happy, then ain’t nobody happy,” While Herod provided many jobs with his building projects, overall it is safe to say he was hated. Rumors of a prophesied new king could have spread quickly throughout Jerusalem&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and many would have been ready to join a political incursion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve looked at Bethlehem in the Annunciations video so this is just a refresher. Bethlehem is about 4-5 miles from Jerusalem. The main road in the centre of the slide is roughly the same road since antiquity, the Way of the Patriarchs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeshua was born&lt;/strong&gt; between 8 and 4 B.C.E&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The reason he was born &amp;ldquo;B.C.&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;Before Christ&amp;rdquo;) is that Dionysius Exiguus, the sixth century monk who set up the modern calendar, made a mistake in determining the date which was not corrected till later.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Though he died in the early days of the New Testament period, King Herod left a significant mark on the land of Israel for decades to come. His structures at Masada still cause visitors to marvel.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herod was paranoid about his power and was known to eliminate any potential threats, including those of his own family. He built palaces such as Masada in case he needed to flee in the event of a revolt. Ironically Masada has become a symbol of Jewish freedom and independence similar to what the Alamo in Texas means to Texans. Near the very end of the first Jewish Revolt (66-72) a band of Jewish rebels made this their last stand against the Romans. As the Romans were about to breach the walls, Josephus records that they committed mass suicide instead of becoming slaves (well the men would have been killed and the women and children would have been slaves.) To this day one of the mottos of the Israeli Defense Forces is “Masada shall never fall again.” Several IDF units hold their swearing-in ceremonies at Masada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one of Herod’s grand construction projects was the city of Caesarea. Here he constructed a palace, theater, temple, and harbor. Caesarea is the location where the Gospel first went out to the Gentiles. Acts 12 records that Herod Agrippa died in the theater&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;ldquo;images/media/image4.jpeg&amp;rdquo; style=&amp;ldquo;width:60%; float:right /&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christmyths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have several issues with our traditional representation of the wise men versus what the Bible actually says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bible does not record that the shepherds and the wise men visited Jesus at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time the wise men show up, they are in a House in Bethlehem, not a manger. Judging by the decree to kill the boys 2 years and younger, this visit could have happened up to two years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shepherds did not see a star, the Magi did&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the time of year is not mentioned and December is an unlikely month to bring a caravan across the desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Bible does not say there were three wise men. In fact, &amp;ldquo;all Jerusalem was in an uproar.&amp;rdquo; It is highly unlikely that three guys on camels could have caused this. The people possibly were fearing a Parthenian military incursion which means this could have been an entire entourage, such as one sent in advance to spell out the terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magi were pagan astrologers; in that day, “astrology” was more of a “hard science” than we consider it today. Even though these Magi were Pagan, God had chosen to reveal himself to them. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a tradition that Daniel put all this in motion when he was placed in an executive leadership role in Daniel 6. That they saw “his star” could be a reference to Numbers 24:17, where Balaam, also a gentile like the Magi were, said “There shall come forth a star out of Jacob.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;They told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet: “‘And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.’”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mic 5:2&lt;/sup&gt; But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2Sa 5:2&lt;/sup&gt; And the LORD said to (David), ‘You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over Israel.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener notes that the scribes had head knowledge that Messiah was to be born in Bethlehem and received a potential sign from God that this birth had occurred, yet they did nothing with it (either positively has the Magi did or negatively, as Herod will do in verse 16). There’s a huge difference in knowing about Jesus and knowing Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve talked in previous videos about Matthew’s editing, very loose paraphrasing, and broad interpretation of Old Testament prophecies, to the point where he is clearly taking them out of context. “You will shepherd my people Israel,” which is found in 2 Samuel 5:2, isn’t even a prophecy but more of a commission to David. While it seems strange to us and would not be acceptable by today’s academic standards of exegesis, it was very consistent with rabbinic exegesis of the day. Matthew is using the text of 2 Samuel 5:2 as what is called a “midrash” which serves to expand on Micah 5:2, Lancaster rephrases this as, “The ruler coming forth from Bethlehem is Messiah, Son of David who will shepherd Israel just as David of Bethlehem did.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a fair question to ask why the Magi went to Jerusalem if the Messiah was prophesied to be born in Bethlehem. It’s logical for the Magi to assume the messiah would have been born in Jerusalem, and possibly been one of Herod’s sons. Also, Bethlehem and Jerusalem are only a few miles apart. When they go to Bethlehem Luke records that a star will guide thim; this is reminiscent of the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night that guided the children of Israel in the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col style=&#34;width: 50%&#34; /&gt;

&lt;th&gt;Matthew 2:7-8&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared. And he sent them to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bethlehem, saying, “Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 2:6 For you have rejected your people, the house of Jacob, because they are full of things from the east and of fortune-tellers like the Philistines, and they strike hands with the children of foreigners.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of reacting favorably to the news the Messiah was born, Herod, like most other pagan rulers of his day attempted to divine from the stars things pertaining to the fate of his kingdom. The problem is such divination was forbidden for Jews in Deuteronomy 18. Here Isaiah makes an interesting statement that God’s people look to “things from the east and of fortune tellers.” this is exactly what Herod does even though He’s just been read Micah 5:2. The ancients thought comets and falling stars predicted the fall of rulers; some emperors even banished from Rome astrologers who issued such predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: Herod has no intention of Worshipping Jesus. He never hesitated to murder anyone whom he saw as a threat to his throne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Magi traveled six miles (10 km) south from Jerusalem to Bethlehem. Since some time had apparently passed (up to two years), and verse 11 mentions the “house” where Jesus’s family was staying, it is likely that they had moved from the place where Jesus was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col style=&#34;width: 50%&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;After listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And going into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh. And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to &lt;strong&gt;Egypt&lt;/strong&gt;, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 60:5-6&lt;/sup&gt; The wealth of the nations shall come to you. A multitude of camels shall cover you, the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all those from Sheba shall come. They shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall bring good news, the praises of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Psa 45:8&lt;/sup&gt; your robes are all fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen 37:28&lt;/sup&gt; Then Midianite traders passed by. And they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. They took Joseph to Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three gifts are likely where we get the tradition of “three wise men”. Although we often picture treasure troves of gold being presented, Scripture doesn’t tell us how much gold was provided to them or what happened to it. We know that the offering of the two pigeons at the temple indicates Mary and Joseph were poor (although the Maji visit could have happened after Luke recorded that event at the temple). We get no indication that the family had any significant wealth either during Jesus’ childhood or after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myrrh had a number of uses, including incense (Exod 30:23), perfume (Ps 45:9), cosmetic (Esth 2:13), anesthetic (Mark 15:23), and embalming (John 19:39).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the main road in and out of town would have taken them directly through Jerusalem, they had to find another way. We don’t really know which way they went. Again, they likely had a large entourage, making clandestine travel difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-flight-to-egypt&#34;&gt;The Flight to Egypt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Matthew 2:13&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to &lt;strong&gt;Egypt&lt;/strong&gt;, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen 37:28&lt;/sup&gt; Then Midianite traders passed by. And they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. They took Joseph to Egypt.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are literally over 100 different ways that the lives of Jacob’s son Joseph and Jesus are connected. Both not only had a sojourn in Egypt but both were also carried off at the hands of Ishmaelites. Edomites and Ishmaelites are interrelated. Joseph was carried by Ishmaelites while Jesus fled the hand of Herod the Edomite. In Gen 37:28 we also see that both were lowered and lifted out of a pit (Jesus when He was imprisoned by Caiaphas) and both were sold for pieces of silver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Matthew 2:14-15&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, “Out of Egypt I called my son.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Hosea 11:1-5&lt;/sup&gt; When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son. The more they were called, the more they went away; they kept sacrificing to the Baals and burning offerings to idols. Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk; I took them up by their arms, but they did not know that I healed them. I led them with cords of kindness, with the bands of love, and I became to them as one who eases the yoke on their jaws, and I bent down to them and fed them. They shall not return to the land of Egypt, but Assyria shall be their king, because they have refused to return to me.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect we can miss is when Jesus, Matthew or Luke references a small segment of one verse, the original audience would more than likely have understood the entire passage. To further complicate matters, sometimes the snippet the apostolic writer quotes may be relatively innocent sounding, but the underlying passage has an entirely different complexion. Such is the case here. First of all, Matthew is taking Hosea entirely out of context. That is not even up for debate. The point is that Jesus epitomizes and fulfills Israel’s history. Keener writes, “Isaiah narrows down the mission of Israel as a whole to the one who can ultimately fulfill that mission and suffer on behalf of the whole people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, there is nothing the slightest bit messianic about Hosea 11. We would be hard-pressed to call verses 1-4 prophecy. It is more of a lamentation. In verse 1, We can see it specifically refers to the nation Israel. Matthew is making a larger point. Just as Israel fled to and was called out from Egypt, so too it is with Messiah. Israel is God’s son; Messiah is God’s Son. Matthew was following common methods of Rabbinical interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part we miss is the entire passage of Hosea. Notice the sadness God has for his people who reject him despite his constant calling, healing, lovingkindness and provision. By the way, this is not just national Israel but you and me when we act ungrateful and stiff-necked. In context Hosea was written to the northern kingdom – because they refuse to serve the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and follow other gods, they will be forced to live under a despotic ruler, Assyria, just as generations before were slaves in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck Missler subtitled his verse-by-verse commentary on Hosea, “Hosea can you see.” His point was the warnings and lamentations God had for the northern kingdom apply to His people living in the United States who reject Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image5.png&#34; style=&#34;width:60%; float:right&#34; /&gt;Bolen notes that Joseph and Mary likely traveled west out of the hill country from Bethlehem and down to the Elah Valley shown in the photo&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. They may have followed a route running similar to the modern road that travels west through the valley. In this case, they would have traveled by the scene where David killed Goliath, perhaps considering that the child with them was the “son of David” who would defeat all of the enemies of God’s people in order to permanently establish the Lord’s kingdom on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other option is heading south through Hebron and down to Beersheba. In this case, I like to imagine the Holy Family thinking of Genesis 22, when God came through in a big way after Abraham nearly offered Isaac. Genesis 22:19 says that Abraham and his men returned to Beersheba. Either way, they would have recalled something miraculous that God did, just as he was doing in their own lives. This is the benefit of visiting Israel for us today. These stories jump off the black and white pages and seem more real somehow. A trip to the Holy Land strengthens our faith in a way that nothing else can.&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image6.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:60%; float:right&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very large Jewish community was in Egypt, particularly in Alexandria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Exo 1:22 Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, “Every son that is born to the Hebrews you shall cast into the Nile, but you shall let every daughter live.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t have any extrabiblical documentation of what is known as the slaughter of the innocents. “Following the Messiah” episode 1 has some interesting speculation on this if you are interested. Even biblical skeptics concede that this behavior of flying into a rage and ordering executions is entirely consistent with everything we know about Herod. Possibly the reason it escaped notice from historians is that we estimate the number of children killed was probably less than 30. This number is shocking to our ears, but Herod and the Romans who followed him didn’t hesitate to have hundreds executed at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, the parallel is there with Pharaoh who gave a similar command only to have God’s appointed deliverer miraculously escape the decree. Just as Moses was saved in the waters of the Nile, so too did Jesus escape across the Nile to safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The First century Jewish Historian Josephus records a legend, “One of the pharaoh’s sacred (astrologers) told the king that a child was about to be born to the Israelites, who, if allowed to live, would humble the kingdom of Egypt and exalt the Israelites. The King was so frightened that he commanded they should cast every male child born to the Israelites into the river and kill it.” Lancaster writes, “Matthew’s readers would have known this legend about the astrologers and the birth of Moses. They would have seen that the birth of Jesus followed the pattern set by Moses.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah: “A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be comforted because they are no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, “Rise, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child&#39;s life are dead.” And he rose and took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jer 31:15 Thus says the LORD: “A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted for her children, because they are no more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Exo 12:39&lt;/sup&gt; And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough that they had brought out of Egypt, for it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt and could not wait, nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bolen: “Archaeologists discovered the remains of Herod’s tomb in 2007. Most of it was destroyed, but experts were able to reconstruct it based upon the fragments found.” &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herod knew he was hated by the people who were likely to be very happy when he died. There’s a famous story that when Herod was about to die, he had several prominent and popular Jewish sages arrested. He gave orders that as soon as he died, the sages were to be murdered, thus causing the people to mourn “as such as never had any king before him; the nation would mourn from their very soul.” After he died, His sister Salome hurried to the prison and lied that Herod had ordered the sages released. All Israel now had two reasons to rejoice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of Galilee. And he went and lived in a city called Nazareth, so that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, that he would be called a Nazarene.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And when they had performed everything according to the Law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom. And the favor of God was upon him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 11:1&lt;/sup&gt; There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Zec 3:8&lt;/sup&gt; Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who sit before you, for they are men who are a sign: behold, I will bring my servant the Branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Jer 23:5&lt;/sup&gt; “Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface this prophecy by Matthew is puzzling. There is no passage in the Old Testament that says “He shall be called a Nazarene.” Therefore people conclude matthew was either misinformed or he fabricated the whole story. The key is understanding that the root word for Nazareth is Netzer, which means branch or sprout. This word is used in Isaiah 11:1. In Zechariah 3:8 and Jer 23:5 a synonym is used, Tzemach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In other words, Matthew is not referring to just one prophecy when he says “He shall be called a Nazarene,” nor is he quoting a particular passage. This is why he says “spoken by the prophet&lt;strong&gt;S”&lt;/strong&gt; In every other citation he uses prophet, singular but here he communicates the substance of several prophets.” COM 131&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image7.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:60%; float:right&#34; /&gt;As the holy family was in Egypt Jerusalem descended into chaos. Rome had ordered that her image of a golden eagle be hoisted above the Temple gates, which was a deliberate offense to the Jews who considered Herod complicit in the deed. Curiously this was a fulfilment of prophecy. Hosea 8:1: Hos 8:1 Set the trumpet to your lips! One like a vulture is over the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant and rebelled against my law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several devout believers scaled the Temple walls and threw down the eagle. Herod reacted with mass arrests and executions. Since we’ve been talking about omens, Josephus records that night following the executions, there was a full moon and Herod’s health started failing. Herod knowing the people hated him had grew concerned more of the most popular sages arrested and imprisoned in Jericho. He gave the order that as soon as he died, the sages were to be murdered, thus causing the people to mourn “as such as never had any king before him; the nation would mourn from their very soul.” After he died, His sister Salome hurried to the prison and lied that Herod had ordered the sages released. All Israel now had two reasons to rejoice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archelaus was what we might call a train-wreck. Keener: Archelaus exhibited his father’s worst flaws. The romans ultimately deposed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph opted instead for the territory of Antipas, who was slightly less dangerous than Archaleous. Antipas is the Herod who has john the Baptist executed and who will mock Jesus just before His crucifixion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jesus’s day, the population of Nazareth was probably only a few hundred people but archaeologists believe many people moved here from near Bethlehem, David’s town. Since Netzer means “branch” perhaps these were the original branch davidians. (if you’re not old enough to understand that joke, consider yourself blessed!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover. And when he was twelve years old, they went up according to custom. And when the feast was ended, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it, but supposing him to be in the group they went a day&amp;rsquo;s journey, but then they began to search for him among their relatives and acquaintances, and when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching for him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord commanded Israelite men to appear before him three times a year (Deut 16:16). Today, 2,000 years after the time of Jesus, Jewish families continue to “go up” to Jerusalem for the three annual feasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern notes that in that day, the tradition made allowances for folks far away, including granting an exception to the Torah requirement for those who would have had to travel long distances. Despite this, note that Joseph and Mary went to Passover every year.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was considered to have “come of age” when He reached twelve, but it is not known if a custom similar to today’s bar mitzvah was practiced in the 1st century AD. A bar mizvah as we know it today was first recorded not until the middle ages, but it appears to have roots in whatever was practiced in that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, many Jewish boys celebrate their bar mitzvahs at the Western Wall prayer plaza. In the photo above, the 13-year-old is wearing phylacteries and reading from the Torah Scroll. Overall it’s a joyous occasion, socially similar to a baptism in the church today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. And when his parents saw him, they were astonished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and I have been searching for you in great distress.” And he said to them, “Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father&#39;s house?”  And they did not understand the saying that he spoke to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Exo 20:12&lt;/sup&gt; “Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are probably not appreciating the non-verbal cues in verse 48-51. In no way is Jesus being snotty or disrespectful. The commandment to honor one’s father and mother was one of the most important – we will see this in verse 51 where Jesus is “submissive” to them. Stern notes that in light of what had already been revealed to them back when he was born, they should have known where to look. Another thought is Joseph and Mary likely would have been very proud of their oldest son involved in an adult-level discussion with elite sages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most visitors are surprised today at the expansive size of the Temple Mount. At about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;35 acres (14 ha), the Temple Mount would fit a total of 25 football fields. Joseph and Mary could have spent several hours looking before they found Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may find that answering a question with another question is irritating, but in that day asking intelligent questions was a way of demonstrating that you understand the material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus respectfully but unapologetically explained to His parents that the study of the Word took priority at that moment. Jesus would later use His knowledge of Scripture to fend off the devil’s attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we grow as talmidim, disciples, we want to be just like Jesus, which means, among our other necessary priorities such as work and tending to our families, we need to be consistently setting aside time for the serious study of His word. We have no idea when our time of temptation will come but the one thing we can do now is to be as prepared as possible by having a deep relationship with Jesus and His word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;td&gt;And he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was submissive to them. And his mother treasured up all these things in her heart. And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not exactly true to say we know nothing of Jesus childhood outside of the Temple incident. Verse 52 tells us a lot, that Jesus increased with wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Dehut, concludes “Even without very many details of Jesus’ upbringing, you can clearly see the rural influence in how He taught. In the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7) He will spoke about Salt and Lamps, birds, lilies and grass, grapes, figs and trees. His parables had a rural focus, using seeds, weeds, leaven, fields, merchants and fishing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The time Jesus spent growing up in the rustic town of Nazareth with the humble family of Joseph and Mary provided the familial influence and upbringing that God wanted His son to have.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s going to lead in to our application for this lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In JOHN THE IMMERSER, Herod the Great’s sons have divided up the holy land, and the Holy Temple has fallen into the hands of a corrupt and Romanized priesthood. We turn our attention away from palaces and politics to seek a prophet, the voice of one calling in the wilderness. We find John the Immerser preaching on the other side of the Jordan River, near Bethany. John prepares the way through immersion and repentance. The waters of the Jordan River run with history and spiritual significance. Those waters have served as a place of renewal for the people of Israel more than once. The people seeking the prophet and his immersion must cross over its waters again to re-enter the land with a new heart and new commitment to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-word-on-the-lesson-title&#34;&gt;A word on the lesson title&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In messianic Jewish circles, John the Baptist is often referred to as “John the immerser.” The reason for this is the term “Baptist” has become somewhat of a charged term theologically (positively and negatively). Immersion reminds us that Christian baptism has its roots in Jewish ritual immersion in a pool of “living water” (either a spring-fed river or lake, or a cistern used to collect rainwater) and is not an entirely new practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-time-of-the-beginning&#34;&gt;The time of the beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Mat 3:1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Mar 1:1,4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luk 3:1-2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God…John appeared baptizing in the wilderness&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Augustus was the Caesar at the time of Jesus’ birth; in 14 he was succeeded by Tiberius. If we assume Luke is counting from the beginning of Tiberius’ reign as Emperor (which is only an assumption) 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; year would place us in 27/28. Other commentators use other dates to come up with anywhere from 26-30 CE/AD. This results in a crucifixion date between 29-33 CE being defendable. Often the date one picks for the start of His ministry depends on the bias one holds regarding a Friday crucifixion and the Daniel 9 prophecy – we’ll get to both of those questions much later in our study. Unless you need a topic for a PhD thesis in seminary, I recommend we hold dates VERY loosely there’s a lot of ambiguity with calendar conversions and dating methods. Luke says Jesus was ”about thirty” when He started his ministry – if He started in the year 28, he would have been in his mid-30s (remember He had to be born prior to 4 BC when Herod the great died).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The region of Judea, Samaria and Idumea was first given to Archelaus, who as we mentioned last time fits the modern definition of a train wreck. He was deposed in 6 CE and was exiled. At this time Rome brought in Governors or Procurators, All Rome asked of its citizens was “pay your taxes and don’t revolt”. The procurators were tasked with seeing to both things. The procurators were headquartered at the palace in Caesarea but tended to visit Jerusalem during the feast days where large numbers of Jews &lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:2.45972in;height:2.39375in&#34; /&gt;(most of whom hated Rome) congregated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of Jesus, the procurator was Pontius Pilate. Some scholars doubted Pilate’s existence until a stone with an inscription referencing Pontius pilate prefect of Judea was found at Caesarea. The stone was found in the theater at Caesarea upside down. Even back then they were into recycling. Pontius Pilate was appointed governor of Judea in AD 26/27, and he held the post until March of AD 37. This inscription was found in secondary use in the theater of Caesarea. A suggested restoration reads: “Pontius Pilate, Prefect of Judea, made and dedicated the Tiberium to the Divine Augustus.” The stone is the first and only mention of Pilate from an archaeological source. Today a replica is on display at the national park in Caesarea and the original is in the Israel Museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herod Philip had the northern districts including villages such as Bethsaida and Caesarea Philippi where Peter will later make his famous declaration. When asked “who do YOU say I am”, Peter answered, “you are the Messiah.” Jesus asks us that same question today and every day. In the Gospels, the scene at Caesarea Philippi is the high-water mark of sorts. Jesus would now begin to teach and repeat overtly that he would suffer and die. Both thematically as well as geographically, the rest of the gospels picture Jesus moving from Caesarea Philippi with Peter’s proclamation, which should have been EVERYONE’s proclamation, up to Jerusalem where he would be crucified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Herod that will give Jesus the most trouble is Antipas. Antipas was over galilee and the territory east of the Jordan called Perea. John the Baptist will accuse Antipas of adultery, and even the Jewish historian Josephus records that Antipas was politically threatened by John the Baptist. Jesus calls Antipas a “fox” in Luke 13 and they finally met face to face on the day Jesus was crucified. Jesus was before pilate being interrogated. When Pilate learned that Jesus was from Galilee, Pilate was concerned about a jurisdictional issue and had Jesus transferred to Antipas. Jesus said nothing to Antipas who mocked him and sent Jesus back to Pilate where he was given over to be crucified. Antipas would eventually be exiled just as his brother Archelaus was and replaced by Herod Agrippa I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Decapolis (which means “ten cities) were gentile territory where Jesus fed the 4000 and expelled the demons into the herd of pigs, which Chuck Missler affectionally labels, “the first case of deviled ham”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schlegel notes that “Jews were unhappy with this complicated arrangement of foreign roman domination.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In other words, Messianic hopes were high that God would correct this situation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster reports that between the time John’s father Zechariah served in the temple and the start of John’s ministry, the Romans began to sell the office of the high priest to the highest bidder, and of course, it only was awarded to those loyal to Rome. Annas was like a mafia godfather. Josephus records the political intrigue that resulted in Caiaphas being appointed High Priest, with Annas behind the scenes pulling the strings. The family controlled the high priesthood between 6 and 66. You know the saying about absolute power corrupting absolutely. These were the corrupt Sadducees and they virtually controlled the Sanhedrin in the days of Jesus and Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we get the idea that all of Jesus’ opponents were a single collective group – not so – the Pharisees tried to live their lives strictly by the word of God, so they detested the politically corrupt Sadducees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilderness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Judean wilderness between Jerusalem and Jericho is virtually uninhabitable apart from a few isolated monasteries first built in the Byzantine period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying “The word of God came to John” is linking John with the Old Testament prophets who received supernatural revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wilderness recalls the 40 years wilderness wanderings in Exodus. Lancaster: “Just as he led them into Canaan in the past, He will lead them from the wilderness into the Messianic Era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Lexham Geographic Commentary, Aubrey Taylor notes, “The wilderness paradoxically symbolizes chaos and distance from God, as well as a place for God to create new life and order. In the wilderness, God created a people and bound them to Himself, laying a foundation for the future nation. John likely believed he was initiating God’s return by enacting prophetic passages in a literal way within the wilderness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark begins his gospel narrative here, completely bypassing the birth and childhood events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark presents Jesus as the servant of all and focuses primarily on what Jesus did to serve mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essentially Peter’s gospel, and it moves like Peter did. Quick fire hits. We can imagine Peter dictating to Mark in Hebrew, while Mark translated into Greek, trying to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark does not have a genealogy because, as Missler says, “we aren’t interested in the pedigree of a servant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.2&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;2 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.3&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;3 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, “The voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.4&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;4 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Now John wore a garment of camel&#39;s hair and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.5&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;5 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.6&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;6 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.2&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;2 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, “Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.3&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;3 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight,’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.4&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;4 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.5&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;5 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.6&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;6 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Now John was clothed with camel&#39;s hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.3&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;3 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And he went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.4&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;4 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, “The voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.5&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;5 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall become straight, and the rough places shall become level ways,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.6&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;6 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;What do you say about yourself?” [23] He said, “I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as the prophet Isaiah said.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 3:2 says, “repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” This is John’s gospel message. It is also Jesus’ gospel message (Matthew 4:17) and it is also the disciples’ Gospel message (Matthew 10:2). Note the gospel message is not “believe in me so you can live however you want and still go to heaven when you die”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repent means return to God, literally it means to turn around and go the other direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kingdom of heaven, as interpreted by Rabbi Lichtenstein is “both the external state where Messiah reigns over the whole earth and the internal state of the individual who is forgiven and spiritually regenerated by the LORD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is at hand – the kingdom messianic age is about to begin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All four gospels say that John’s ministry fulfills Isaiah 40:3. The Isaiah passage begins with “comfort, comfort my people” (40:1) and then goes into the voice of one crying in the wilderness (40:3). God’s Comfort is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism and its Jewish predecessor immersion in a Mikveh carries a tie to ritual cleanliness and confession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the firstborn son of a priest, John should have been serving in the temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was either disenfranchised and pushed out by the corruption, or he voluntarily withdrew because he wanted nothing to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible does not tell us that he abandoned his priestly obligations, so we need to be cautious with inferring this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do have some suggestion that John affiliated with another group of disaffected priests known as the Essenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Essenes lived at Qumron and are presumed to be the authors of the dead sea scrolls. Qumron is located in the Judean Wilderness on the Northwestern shore of the Dead Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They opposed the sold-out, corrupted, Rome-loving, Hasmonean and Sadducean priesthood of Jerusalem.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars debate whether he was formally an Essene, merely was familiar with the Essenes and shared some similarities, or was not affiliated with them in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster writes, “John and his disciples are associated with, and at points, endorsed by the Pharisees; this would not have happened if John were a known Essene.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His attire alludes to Elijah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2Ki 1:8 They answered him, “He wore a garment of hair, with a belt of leather about his waist.” And he said, “It is Elijah the Tishbite.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jordan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the area of, and perhaps the exact location where Moses called the nation to make a covenant with the LORD and Joshua crossed the river and lead Israel into the promised land.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locusts &amp;amp; wild honey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 7:33 reminds us John was a Nazirite from birth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“John entrusted himself solely to God for his daily needs,”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which is reminiscent of the Israelites in the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deu 29:5-6 I have led you forty years in the wilderness. Your clothes have not worn out on you, and your sandals have not worn off your feet. [6] You have not eaten bread, and you have not drunk wine or strong drink, that you may know that I am the LORD your God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Locusts could be insects or it could be carob pods from the locust tree, a tree that would have been available in parts of the Judean wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honey could refer to the syrup of dates and figs in addition to bee honey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John exemplified Jesus’ teaching on “do not be worried about what you will eat or drink” (Matthew 6:25)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His attire alludes to Elijah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John wore clothing that was not purchased in the markets of Jerusalem. John’s dress reminded the people of the prophet Elijah, who wore a garment of hair (2 Kgs Mark 1:8). Indeed, John came in the spirit and power of Elijah to warn of impending judgment before the Lord’s appearance (Mal 3:1-6; 4:5-6).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.7&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;7 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; He said therefore to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.8&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;8 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Bear fruits in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.9&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;9 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.10&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;10 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And the crowds asked him, “What then shall we do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.11&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;11 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And he answered them, “Whoever has two tunics is to share with him who has none, and whoever has food is to do likewise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.12&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;12 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Tax collectors also came to be baptized and said to him, “Teacher, what shall we do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.13&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;13 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And he said to them, “Collect no more than you are authorized to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.14&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;14 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Soldiers also asked him, “And we, what shall we do?” And he said to them, “Do not extort money from anyone by threats or by false accusation, and be content with your wages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the seeker-friendly message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus will have a lot to say about bearing fruit during His ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say it often, but our works matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t do good works to get saved; we do good works because we already are saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A healthy fruit tree will bear fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are saved, there should be evidence of good works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By saying “Bear fruit in keeping with repentance” John is confirming that immersion must be an outward expression of an inward change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He didn’t see any fruit of an inward change, so he refused to permit the outward expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Matthew mentioning Pharisees and Sadducees we might get the impression that John is rejecting the religious and allowing sinners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why there is value of comparing passages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke makes it clear that John rejected ANYONE who was unrepentant, whether they were in vocational ministry or everyday folk such as soldiers and common folk, or vocational sinners such as tax-collectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 21:32 also references John ministering to prostitutes, which can include “fallen women” for any reason not limited to sex for hire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did not single out just the religious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What he is likely railing against here is what we might call “cheap grace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when the golden calf incident happened, God was ready to wipe the people out, Moses ”reminded” God of his promises to Abraham and God relented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, it became fashionable to rely on their familial connection to righteous Abraham to cover up sins in much the same way that Christians invoke the atoning sacrifice of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is when they invoke Abraham, or we invoke Jesus to exonerate us from personal responsibility.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we will note is the old adage whenever you point a finger at someone, there are three fingers pointing back at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we do this today? Do we ever say “well, I’m saved by Jesus so I’m forgiven”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we say that from a posture of contrition and repentance it’s absolutely true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we say it as an excuse to keep on sinning WITHOUT repenting, then it’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What shall we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After shooting painfully straight with his audience the faithful asked “what then shall we do?” There’s hope in this. None of us are beyond the father’s reach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John prescribes acts of lovingkindness, called chesed in Hebrew; these deeds achieve the spirit of the commandment to love one’s neighbor as one’s self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of note, John allowed them to stay in their occupations provided they conduct their lives with the highest standards of ethics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soldiers here are unlikely to be Roman soldiers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John’s ministry did not extend to gentiles and Romans would have had no interest in anything Jewish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given where he was (Perea), the soldiers were likely employed by Herod Antipas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These stones&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Joshua 4, God commanded stones of rememberance be placed to mark the moment where Israel was consecrated and crossed in to inherit the promised land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, the words for “stones” and “sons” only differ by one letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A possible point could be a warning for them to not rely on cheap grace. In other words, “don’t fool yourselves. There are plenty of genuinely repentant righteous people who produce good fruit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also a sense could be “be like the original generation who crossed at this location by faith.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Judaism, a gentile convert receives the title “Son of Abraham.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.7&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;7 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And he preached, saying, “After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:41.1.8&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;8 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.15&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;15 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As the people were in expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Christ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.16&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;16 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; John answered them all, saying, “I baptize you with water, but he who is mightier than I is coming, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Joh 1:19-28 And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?” [20] He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.” [21] And they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.” [22] So they said to him, “Who are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” [23] He said, “I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as the prophet Isaiah said.” [24] (Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.) [25] They asked him, “Then why are you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” [26] John answered them, “I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know, [27] even he who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.” [28] These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John’s message was that the Messianic Age was about to commence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This naturally led some to wonder whether John was the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In John 1:20, he says that he is not the messiah but is the forerunner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Talmud records, “a disciple must render to his teacher all the service that a slave renders to his master except that of loosening his shoe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John is saying “I’m not even worthy to be regarded as Jesus’ slave.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water vs Holy Spirit and fire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrival of Messiah has two different implications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the believers who repent and bear fruit (the righteous), Jesus brings an immersion in the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the unbelievers who don’t repent and don’t bear fruit (the wicked), the coming of Messiah brings judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book of Proverbs is our go-to reference when we study the righteous versus the wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the righteous, as it is today with Christian baptism, water is an outward sign that symbolizes spiritual regeneration in the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus Jesus says in John 3:5, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:40.3.12&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;12 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.17&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;17 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;verseid:42.3.18&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;18 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; So with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mal 4:1&lt;/sup&gt; “For behold, the day is coming, burning like an oven, when all the arrogant and all evildoers will be stubble. The day that is coming shall set them ablaze, says the LORD of hosts, so that it will leave them neither root nor branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mal 4:5-6&lt;/sup&gt; “Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes. [6] And he will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the land with a decree of utter destruction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that day they would take a tool like a pitchfork and toss the kernels up into the air. The heavier seed would drop into one pile and the lighter chaff would be carried downwind into a separate pile. This was usually done on a plateau called a threshing floor. At the end the seeds would be gathered into a barn or a storehouse, and the chaff would be burned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew and Luke develop this theme of spirit vs fire with a quick one-verse parable, which we may call “the winnower, the wheat, and the chaff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winnowing fork = instrument of Messiah’s judgment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winnower’s hand = Messiah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threshing floor = Land of Israel/or the world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barn = the Kingdom of Heaven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheat = repentant righteous&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaff = unrepentant wicked - The image of the wicked as chaff is common in the Old Testament (Ps 1:4; Isa 40:24; Dan 2:35).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning: Messiah is coming to punish the wicked and reward the righteous. I, John, am bringing you this good news and therefore begging each of you to repent and do works of righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, John is the fulfillment (at least partially) of Malachi 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many believe Elijah himself is one of the two witnesses in Revelation 11, at which time Malachi’s prophecy would be completely fulfilled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John’s mission was to call God’s people to repentance and right behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it’s as if John is saying, “you can &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; me you’re repentant, but you need to prove it to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When things are going well it&amp;rsquo;s easy to trick ourselves into thinking that God must be really proud of our piety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all must turn to God for our provision. Again we don’t do good works to get saved, we do good works and bear good fruit because we are saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fruit of repentance is a life of good deeds that reflect our love for God and our love for our neighbors, just as Jesus instructs his disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>7. Immersion and Temptation</title>
      <link>https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/gb2/7-immersion-and-temptation/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In IMMERSION AND TEMPTATION, more than two decades have elapsed since we last visited. Yeshua is no longer a precocious twelve-year-old boy; he is a grown man who has taken over His father Joseph’s carpenter trade. From Nazareth, we follow Yeshua’s family to the plains of the Jordan, across from Jericho, where John the Immerser is at work, proclaiming the good news and immersing for repentance. After His baptism, we follow Yeshua out into the dry and waterless Judean Wilderness between Jerusalem and Jericho where He spends forty days in prayer and fasting. Early Christians preserved the memory of the traditional location of the temptations. They named a certain high hill in the Jordan Valley, two miles northwest of Jericho, as “The Mount of the Temptation.” Today, a Greek Orthodox monastery marks the location.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>8. The First Sign</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In THE FIRST SIGN, we join Yeshua and His handful of followers in the Jordan River Valley near Jericho. We follow them north along the eastern side and pick up more disciples on Lake Galilee’s north shore in Bethsaida and Capernaum. A fishing boat takes us across the lake to Magdala.  From there, it’s a day’s walk to Cana of Galilee on the northern slopes of the Nazareth ridge, where Yeshua and His first followers attend a wedding. From there, we follow them back to Capernaum on the north shore of Lake Galilee, where they join a pilgrimage making their way down the Jordan Valley, following its eastern bank, before crossing near Jericho and ascending to Jerusalem for the Festival of Passover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeshua is IN JERUSALEM, the holy city, for the Passover festival and remains in Judea for a few extra weeks while His disciples immerse new penitents. Meanwhile, John the Immerser moves his work into Samaria and begins immersing “at Aenon near Salim,” leaving Yeshua and His followers to baptize in the area around Jerusalem. Salim is a fertile valley in Samaria east of Shechem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IN SAMARIA follows Jesus as he leaves Jerusalem and make his way back north to Galilee. Yeshua elects to travel through Samaria, the most direct route to reach Nazareth. We stop at the village of Sychar where Yeshua encounters the Samaritan woman. His disciples return to their homes on the lake, Yeshua take us to Cana. An official from Capernaum travels to Cana to find Yeshua and to implore Him to heal his son.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In A PROPHET WITHOUT HONOR, we leave the village of Cana and follow Yeshua back to Nazareth to spend a quiet Shabbat in His hometown. The view from atop the Nazareth hill affords us a splendid view of the Jezreel Valley, Mount Tabor, and the surrounding territory. Take a walk around town and take in the sights as the shops close and people prepare for Sabbath. This is where our Master grew up.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the POOLS OF BETHESDA, we follow Yeshua as He makes another pilgrimage to Jerusalem to keep one of the festivals. On the Sabbath day, we head for the Temple. On the way there, we walk along the city walls and cut through the five-colonnaded double pool of Bethesda on our way to the Sheep Gate. Then we duck inside and up to the Temple to spend the rest of the day, where a delegation from the religious leaders in Judea reprimands Him for healing on the Sabbath. The ensuing discourse occurs within the Temple courts, but the discussion takes us from the carpenter shop in Nazareth to the end of the era, the resurrection of the dead, the Messianic Kingdom, and the final judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a confrontation with the religious leaders in Judea, Yeshua seeks a place where He can conduct His ministry in the safety of relative obscurity. We follow Him back to the Galilee, but not back to Nazareth. Instead, He goes to the north shore of Lake Galilee for a visit to CAPERNAUM, the town of Simon Peter. We visit the village synagogue and Simon Peter’s house. Local tradition identifies a cave overlooking the lake near Capernaum and Tabgha as the “secluded place” where Yeshua used to pray. He says that He must leave Capernaum to take the good news of the kingdom to other villages. He invites the fishermen to join Him on the journey, but He does most of His miracles and teaching along the north shore of the lake within ten miles of Capernaum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lesson is titled, &amp;ldquo;Zacchaeus and Bartimaeus&amp;rdquo; because of the healings, one physical and one spiritual of Blind Bartimaeus and Zacchaeus the wealthy tax collector.  In Luke, Jesus also gives the double-parable of the Minas (Pounds) and the King&amp;rsquo;s Return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson begins with Jesus passing through Jericho on His way up to Jerusalem for the Passover.  What Jesus knew, and what we, the readers, know, but what the disciples and others at the scene did not know is that this would be the final stop of His earthly ministry.  The most tumultuous and historically significant week in all of human history was about to begin, but first Jesus continues His mission to seek and save the lost sheep of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;29. As they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;46. And they came to Jericho. And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;35. As he drew near Jericho…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Notes:&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Matthew and Mark say they were leaving Jericho, while Luke says they were drawing near Jericho need not concern us. Dr. Bolen writes, “it is apparent that Jesus was leaving the population center of Jericho (as recorded in Matthew) and entering the area of the Herodian city (as recorded in Luke).”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lesson takes place in and around the city of Jericho. Jericho is only about 15 miles from Jerusalem, but they couldn’t be more opposite in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/64e48fd0624a152b3cd6f2097b3af360.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Jericho&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jericho lies deep in the Jordan Rift Valley, around 900 feet below sea level.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare this to Jerusalem, high in the Judean hills at about 2500 feet above sea level&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Jericho, freshwater is plentiful from the many springs. It is known as the “city of palms” because it is very much an oasis in the desert.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jerusalem’s only source of freshwater, the Gihon Spring, can only provide water for a few thousand people per year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jericho commands the central east-west approach to Jerusalem, making it strategically important.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Jordan was relatively easy to cross near Jericho.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This factor contributed to the wealth of Zacchaeus, the tax collector who was able to tax people coming and going.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite having tremendous religious importance, Jerusalem is neither strategic nor wealthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;

    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Jericho Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empires from the Persians to the Romans used Jericho as an administrative center. Alexander the Great had a private estate here. Mark Antony gave Jericho to Cleopatra as a gift. As we noted last time, Herod the Great had a palace here, which would still have been in use as Jesus made His way through the city. Much like he did with Jerusalem, Herod expanded his “footprint” in the city with several public works, military buildings, a hippodrome/theatre complex to entertain the masses, and of course, his lavish private palace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Israel’s history, we know that Jericho is significant for being the first town Joshua and the Israelites could capture using a unique battle plan. Of significance for us is the town of Gilgal. This is where God made the Israelites stop, get circumcised (a very odd thing to do before a battle!), sanctify themselves, and celebrate Passover (Joshua 5:1-12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back even further, archeologists have unearthed artifacts that date to ~8000 BCE in the new stone age period – that’s 6000 years before Abraham. Historians believe Jericho is the oldest, continuously inhabited city in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The setting here is a little over a week before Passover. Crowds are beginning to swell. The beginning of the narrow Ascent of Adummim would have represented a bottleneck, with people backing into Jericho.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, primarily, but perhaps not exclusively due to Jesus, the expectation grew for a Messianic deliverer. Such hope is always higher around Passover, as the feast recalls Israel’s miraculous deliverance from oppressive Egypt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those who realized God sent Jesus had every reason to think a similar redemption was at hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blind-bartimaeus&#34;&gt;Blind Bartimaeus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mat 20:29-34&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mar 10:46-52&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luk 18:35-43&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Matthew 20&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luke 18&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;29. As they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him. 30. And behold, two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!” 31. The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be silent, but they cried out all the more, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;46. And they came to Jericho. And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the roadside. 47. And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” 48. And many rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;35. As he drew near Jericho, a blind man sat begging by the roadside. 36. Hearing a crowd going by, he inquired what this meant. 37. They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.” 38. And he cried out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” 39. And those in front rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again, we note Mark’s attention to detail. He gives us the beggar’s name, Bartimaeus.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since others whom Jesus healed are usually unnamed, this might seem to suggest that Bartimaeus might have achieved some notoriety in the early apostolic community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark also translates the man’s name for his Roman readership who didn’t speak Hebrew or Aramaic. Bar in Aramaic means “son,” so the man’s name means the son of Timaeus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The healing is relatively straightforward, so it could be easy to miss some nuances.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark and Luke record that he is told “Jesus of Nazareth” passes by. ישׁוע (Yeshua) was a widespread name, but there is only one Yeshua of Nazareth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bartimaeus makes a messianic declaration when he exclaims, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” – in other words, this blind man could “see” better than most people of his day. Although he was blind, he saw Jesus clearly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their persistence is admirable. Do we shout louder for Jesus to help us, or do we give up at the first sign of the crowd telling us to be quiet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;One or two? Coming or going?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew and Mark say they were leaving Jericho, but Luke says they drew near Jericho. Matthew says there were two beggars, but Mark and Luke say there was only one. Which is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discussed the first question in the introduction. Jericho’s had two distinct sections: a population and a government center. They were about a mile apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, of the three authors, Luke would have been the least familiar with the geography of Jericho, and he was writing to an audience that would not have necessarily had any familiarity with the region. Perhaps he got this minor detail wrong. If so, insignificant discrepancies such as these need not concern us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to whether one versus two blind people were healed, this is similarly a non-issue, in my opinion. Matthew occasionally says multiple people were involved in an incident when Mark and Luke discuss only one person. Matthew was an eyewitness to these events, whereas the other writers may have edited their stories to focus on the most significant individual. Further, Mark does not say there was “only Bartimaeus.” We can easily reconcile this. They came upon two blind men, one of whom was named Bartimaeus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember that the Books of the Bible are not transcripts of every event that happened. They are carefully edited and revised narratives. They are stories designed to get at the essence of a particular event. Then perhaps they were changed and edited some more as the years passed, leading up to the point at which they were canonized (finalized).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These minor discrepancies are significant for one huge reason: they demonstrate a lack of coordination and collaboration among the gospel writers. If multiple witnesses’ testimonies match too closely, people become suspicious that they might have gotten together beforehand to concoct a cover story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of chronology, Lancaster sees this event as happening after the episodes with Zacchaeus as they were leaving Jerusalem and starting the Ascent of Adummim leading up to Jerusalem. Beggars would have been more “successful” here, where a crowd of people would be converging for the pilgrimage, then elsewhere in the middle of Jericho. Specifically, Lancaster places the event &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; “they came to Jericho” in Mark 10:46, but &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; “And as he was leaving Jericho.” in the same verse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark 10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luke 18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;32. And stopping, Jesus called them and said, “What do you want me to do for you?” 33. They said to him, “Lord, let our eyes be opened.” 34. And Jesus in pity touched their eyes, immediately recovered their sight, and followed him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;49. And Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” And they called the blind man, saying to him, “Take heart. Get up; he is calling you.” 50. And throwing off his cloak, he sprang up and came to Jesus. 51. And Jesus said to him, “What do you want me to do for you?” And the blind man said to him, “Rabbi, let me recover my sight.” 52. And Jesus said to him, “Go your way; your faith has made you well.” And immediately, he recovered his sight and followed him on the way.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;40. And Jesus stopped and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him, 41. “What do you want me to do for you?” He said, “Lord, let me recover my sight.” 42. And Jesus said to him, “Recover your sight; your faith has made you well.” 43. He immediately recovered his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;opened-eyes&#34;&gt;Opened Eyes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They knew what they needed.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He doesn’t ask Jesus for a few coins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He asks to be healed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How often do we ask for the &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; thing we need?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This time, there is no elaborate mud ritual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus’ touch is all the men need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus commends them for their faith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They immediately follow Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of healings have become commonplace in Mark. They have a double purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, Mark records selected events in Jesus’ ministry that demonstrated Jesus’ authority over the physical world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, as Lancaster says, these infirmities “symbolize the Master’s struggle with the spiritual impediments besetting His generation. These impediments prevented the people from repenting, recognizing the Messiah, and obtaining the kingdom.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparison-with-the-rich-young-ruler&#34;&gt;Comparison with the Rich Young Ruler&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster concludes the section with a table comparing the Rich Young Ruler to Blind Bartimaeus, which I have modified slightly&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Rich Young Man&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Blind Bartimaeus&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Request&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“what must I do?” (the man is the focus)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“have mercy on me!” (Jesus is the focus)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jesus’ reply&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“Keep the commandments; sell everything.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“What do you want me to do for you?”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Left all he had and followed Jesus?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes; he threw his cloak aside, which is probably the only thing he owned&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mood after the exchange&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sad, causing others to wonder, “who then can be saved?”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Glorified God, causing others to be awed and praise God&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lesson&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;When we depend on our adequacy and our righteousness, we go away sad&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;When we humble ourselves enough to ask for mercy, we are rewarded for our faith in the Son of David. Our faith is about the best we can offer to Him. He has EVERYTHING to offer us.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zacchaeus-the-tax-collector&#34;&gt;Zacchaeus, the tax collector&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 19:1-4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
1. He entered Jericho and was passing through.
2. And behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector and was wealthy.
3. He was seeking to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd, he could not because he was small in stature.
4. So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for Jesus was about to pass that way.
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/ad09ca3fccdb82076f4cf3d075fcbe64.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are told Zacchaeus was the &lt;em&gt;chief&lt;/em&gt; tax collector, yet he wanted to see Jesus badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This sets the stage for another “last shall be first” reversal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tax collectors were near the bottom of civilized Jewish society (See the call-out box below for further background).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most &amp;ldquo;sinners&amp;rdquo; would avoid someone who is seen as morally superior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zacchaeus was probably less than five feet tall, so he climbed something more like a middle eastern fig tree versus a North American sycamore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These trees have short trunks and branches relatively close to the ground, making them easy to climb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like it is today, climbing trees is seen as a child’s activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could say that by elevating himself, Zacchaeus was lowering himself in the eyes of others.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can draw a parallel to the prodigal son&amp;rsquo;s father.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was considered degrading for the patriarch of the family to run after anything, yet this is exactly what the father did in the story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wonder if both men, the father and Zacchaeus, aren&amp;rsquo;t a picture of our Heavenly Father who will overcome any obstacle to be with us.  Conversely, we should be more like the two men, removing any obstacles that get in our way between us and communion with God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;The taxman cometh&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zacchaeus was hated because he worked for the man…the Ro-man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jericho was a major administrative and tax center, as mentioned in the introduction. It was also a border town between Judea and Perea across the river. Unlike Joshua’s day, the Jordan was easily crossed in Jesus’ time. All of this made Jericho “one of the wealthiest cities of Palestine in the most fertile part of Judea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we introduced Matthew, we talked a bit about the system. They didn’t have actual, fixed tax rates. Whatever the tax collector could muscle out of the victim was fair game. It was a dirty business. If the collector thought someone underpaid his taxes, he had the authority to jail the citizen until he paid up. Further, they had something like a multi-level marketing scheme in which lower tax collectors had to give their bosses a cut. Zacchaeus was at the top of the pyramid, and he was loaded. It’s easy to see how the citizens considered Jews like Matthew and Zacchaeus traitors and thieves. Avoiding the taxman was seen as a duty among the faithful. As a result, tax collectors were ostracized from the rest of Jewish society. They were disqualified from serving as a witness in a trial. Because their occupation required them to be dishonest, they could never be trusted to tell the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, Himself, said His disciples should treat the unrepentant as if he was a tax collector. That is to shun him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Note: &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;friend-of-sinners&#34;&gt;Friend of Sinners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 19:5-7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
5. And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I must stay at your house today.”
6. So he hurried and came down and received him joyfully.
7. And when they saw it, they all grumbled, “He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.”  
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine all the people who wanted to see Jesus, like how our folks line the street of a motorcade today.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not only does he stop and call someone out for special attention, but that person also happens to be a hated tax collector!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luke has a number of these stories that juxtapose a repentant sinner with the murmuring of the self-righteous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zacchaeus would have been well known to the city’s people and not well known in a good way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why would Jesus choose to honor this lowlife?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any food he might serve Jesus would have been purchased with stolen money, making Jesus in some way complicit in the crime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zacchaeus was a symbol of all that was wrong with Roman oppression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zacchaeus was supposed to be ostracized, but Jesus isn’t playing by the rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversely, we can imagine the town’s religious leaders expected Jesus to dine with them.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe they had already started preparing their houses in the hopes that they would get to entertain this critical guest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, this event happened right around the time Jesus told the parable of the workers. Here, we see something very similar.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The “owner” of it all can choose to bestow favor on whomever he pleases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They didn’t like who Jesus chose, so they grumbled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep in mind that these people weren’t simply petty in their dislike for Zacchaeus. He was a thief.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They had probably all been victimized by him, and he made their lives harder than they needed to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus, of course, knows the end from the beginning, and he knows what is going to happen next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;teshuvah&#34;&gt;Teshuvah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 19:8-10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
8. And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold.”
9. And Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house since he also is a son of Abraham.
10. For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I imagine the grumbling people were quite surprised the next day when they got a knock on the door and handed a bag of cash, four times the amount that they had initially been paid!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They were ultimately quite glad Jesus spent some time with Zacchaeus!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Jesus gave him an ultimatum as He did for the Rich Young Ruler, it is not recorded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can take away from the text is that Jesus chose to honor an outcast, and he repented.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that he repented from &lt;em&gt;exploiting others&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on John the Baptist&amp;rsquo;s warning to a previous group of tax collectors, we should not necessarily assume that the man gave up being a tax collector (Luke 3:12-13).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hebrew word for repentance is &lt;em&gt;teshuvah&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As with many Hebrew words, action is implied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we with our &amp;ldquo;western&amp;rdquo; minds think of repentance, we might think of a chance of heart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a Hebraic mindset, that change of heart is always accompanied by action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this case, a good deed reflects repentance that started in the heaert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We touched on this last time with the Rich Young Ruler.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Zacchaeus’ case, his heart was right, so good deeds followed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the young man’s case, his heart wasn’t right despite his claim to have kept all the commandments Jesus listed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a potential that both exchanges happened on the same day, which would have highlighted the contrast in the disciples’ eyes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remuneration
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Torah assigns various levels of remuneration for theft depending on the circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zacchaeus gave himself the highest level: quadruple damages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;yeshua-has-come&#34;&gt;Yeshua has come&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Jesus says, “Today, salvation has come,” this is not because of the good deed of giving half to the poor and remediating with quadruple damages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salvation came because of his repentance, which was subsequently evidenced by the act.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zacchaeus would undoubtedly have been familiar with John the Baptist in this geographic region.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps it was one of Zacchaeus&amp;rsquo; direct-reports who met John the Baptist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While it appears Zacchaeus did not immediately repent at John’s words, perhaps a seed was planted that took some time to grow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to remember this when we don’t see immediate fruit from our ministry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There could be growth going on that we can’t see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is also a deliberate pun. Yeshua means salvation.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not only was Zacchaeus saved in the spiritual sense, Jesus, but the embodiment of salvation had also come to his house and was sitting across from him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Son of Abraham
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is also significant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He was one of the lost sheep of Israel, once thought to be beyond reach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet Jesus restores him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewish people of that day (like many nominal Christians today) believed they had salvation just by being Jewish.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, this could be forfeited by self-exclusion, such as becoming a tax collector or some other type of sinner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we entertain the fact that he remained a tax collector, this inclusion and restoration would have been even more offensive to those in attendance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recall previous lessons where we discussed the divine reversal, including the last lesson where those who showed up for work at the 11th hour (the repentant sinner) got the same wage as those who had been working all day (the lifelong believer).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-man-goes-on-a-journey&#34;&gt;A man goes on a journey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 19:11-12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
11. As they heard these things, he proceeded to tell a parable because he was near to Jerusalem and because they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.
12. He said, therefore, “A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note the last part of verse 11. They expected the political kingdom immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Journey parables have a common theme.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Man goes on a journey, yet before he leaves, he entrusts his operation to a group of servants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When he returns, typically unexpectedly, the owner demands an accounting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The righteous are rewarded while the wicked are punished&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the original audience, there may have been (at least) three layers of intended meaning:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, we are individually accountable in the absence of direct supervision
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul elaborates on this in Ephesians 6
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the Bible talks about &amp;ldquo;masters&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;slaves&amp;rdquo;, we need to substitute &amp;ldquo;employers&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;employees&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;clients&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;contractors&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, After His Resurrection, Jesus will be “away” for a while
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The disciples (i.e., you and me) are entrusted not only with keeping the operation moving but also delivering a return on investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When He comes again, not only will the wicked be judged at the Great White Throne Judgment, but those deemed righteous will have their works evaluated at the Bema Seat Judgment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third, Israel has not had direct supervison but now the King is returning and will audit the books
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, the parables possibly explain the coming judgment about to fall on Jerusalem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Through Moses, God had delivered to the people a perfect system for keeping in communion with Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In many ways, the Torah is written like a contract; it promises life to those who fulfill the terms and death to those who do not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now Jesus, in a sense, the “second Moses,” is returning to audit the books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If He found that generation had produced fruit in keeping with repentance, His arrival would have brought reward – the Messianic Kingdom would have begun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since He found that generation had failed to fulfill the terms, His appearance brings judgment – destruction, exile, and a delay of the Kingdom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These three would serve to communicate, albeit indirectly, that He is not the messiah, they’re looking for. There will be no immediate Messianic Kingdom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears Luke may have combined two parables into one. Both begin with “a nobleman went into a far country to claim his Kingdom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The “Parable of the Minas” is Luke 12-13, 15b-26.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The “Parable of the King’s Return” is Luke 12, 14-15a, 27.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both parables begins with a nobleman going into a far country to receive his kingdom. Keener points out, “Herod the Great (in 40 BCE) and Archelaus (in 4 BCE) each had to go to Rome to receive their right to rule Judea&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus’ audience would have immediately recalled this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When they heard the opening words of the parable, they would have thought, “oh, you mean just like Herod and Archelaus.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means, to the original audience hearing the parable, the protagonist in the parable was hated, wicked, and dishonest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we evaluate the parables, we need to keep in mind Jesus’ stated reason for telling them: BECAUSE THEY SUPPOSED THE KINGDOM OF GOD WAS TO APPEAR IMMEDIATELY.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;parable-of-the-minas&#34;&gt;Parable of the Minas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 19:12-15&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
12. He said, therefore, “A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.
13. Calling ten of his servants, he gave them ten minas and said to them, ‘Engage in business until I come.’
15. When he returned, having received the kingdom, …
15. … he ordered these servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by doing business.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A mina was roughly three months’ wages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As is the theme with “man goes on a journey” parables, the workers are given an unannounced amount of time to grow their investments.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although it is not stressed in this parable, in “Journey Parables,” the master returns unannounced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means the workers (or bridesmaids) should constantly be in a heightened state of preparedness and expectation regardless of the length of the absence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-audit&#34;&gt;The audit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 19:16-26&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
16. The first came before him, saying, ‘Lord, your mina has made ten minas more.’
17. And he said to him, ‘Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.’
18. And the second came, saying, ‘Lord, your mina has made five minas.’
19. And he said to him, ‘And you are to be over five cities.’
20. Then another came, saying, ‘Lord, here is your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief;
21. I was afraid of you because you are a severe man. You take what you did not deposit and reap what you did not sow.’
22. He said to him, ‘I will condemn you with your own words, you wicked servant! You knew that I was a severe man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow?
23. Why then did you not put my money in the bank, and at my coming, I might have collected it with interest?’
24. And he said to those who stood by, ‘Take the mina from him, and give it to the one who has the ten minas.’
25. And they said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten minas!’
26. ‘I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although ten servants were given a mina each, we are only told the audit results of three.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first two must have had good asset managers as the ROI (return on investment) was 1000% and 500%, respectively.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to one commentator, this return is too good to be true; therefore, we should understand and apply the meaning of the parable accordingly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They were then put in charge over much more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third wrapped up his mina in a scarf.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In that culture, wrapping up a sum of money and laying it away meant it couldn’t be touched.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;matthews-parable-of-the-talents-matthew-25&#34;&gt;Matthew&amp;rsquo;s Parable of the Talents (Matthew 25)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although the parables are quite similar, there are some key differences
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Matthew’s version, there are three servants, not ten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The currency is a “talent” (a talent is 6000 denarii – so 23-25 years’ wages – a significant sum!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of each servant getting equal, the three servants get 5, 2, and 1 respectively.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first two deliver 100% ROI (somewhat more reasonable than the return on the Minas)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These servants are told, “well done, good and faithful servant. You were faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Luke&amp;rsquo;s version, there is no &amp;ldquo;good servant&amp;rdquo; (although there is &amp;ldquo;failthful&amp;rdquo;), neither is there &amp;ldquo;joy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third servant responds much like the third servant in the Mina parable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of application, Lancaster concludes, “If the parable of the ten minas describes how equal opportunities can be used differently to achieve different results, the parable of the talents describes how different opportunities and resources can be used equally to achieve the same results.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;” Strikingly, the third servant is not merely reprimanded. Still, he is cast into Gehenna, where “there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” (Matthew 25:30)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prevailing view assumes the parable is roughly equivalent to the Matthew 25 version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The two were rewarded, and the one was punished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we are faithful in the small things, Jesus will reward us with more important things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As for the seemingly impossible rate of return, with man, this is impossible (at least without fraud or insider trading), but all things are possible with God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparation for this lesson, I came across two different views of the meaning of this parable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since both conclusions can benefit us as disciples, I will present them both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The alternative view is discussed at the end of the lesson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming the prevailing view, a takeaway of the parable would be that Jesus doesn’t want us coasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He expects us to produce good works if we are his disciples and servants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again, we do this not to get saved but because we are saved.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish scribes recount similar “faithful with small things” lessons with Moses and David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both started as shepherds leading literal, four-legged sheep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because they proved themselves faithful, God put them each over His people Israel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God tests us in small matters each day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some modifications, Lancaster’s conclusion of the Ten Minas is below&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;King = Messiah&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Journey = Messiah’s absence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Servants = disciples/Israel/you and me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minas = the work of the kingdom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faithful Servants = disciples focused on the kingdom work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfaithful servant = those who have neglected the work of the kingdom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reward = advancement in the kingdom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Punishment = loss of the kingdom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaning = Those faithful with the responsibilities entrusted to them will be rewarded at the coming of the Messiah. Those who are negligent will be punished.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;parable-of-the-kings-return&#34;&gt;Parable of the King’s Return&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
12. He said, therefore, “A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.
14. His citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We do not want this man to reign over us.’
15. … he returned, having received the kingdom, …
27. (and said) these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slaughter them before me.’”
28. When he had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/ae852c903db4cdf4484fba55dd9b9de6.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, hearers of this parable would have immediately recalled the Herodian ruler Archelaus. After Herod the Great died around 4 BCE, his kingdom was split among his sons. Like other famous, wealthy neurotics, Herod had multiple wills that needed to be sorted out. Antipas believed he should have inherited the title “King of the Jews” from his father. The Romans disagreed. Archelaus got Judea and Samaria, Antipas got Galilee and Perea, and Philip got the territory to the northeast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Passover, Archelaus slaughtered approximately 3000 Jews in the temple in Jerusalem&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Following this, a delegation of Judeans went to Rome to petition for relief. Ultimately, he was banished to Vienna, and the Roman Procurators’ age began. See map for these boundaries&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we assume the ruler in the parable(s) is supposed to represent Jesus, why would Jesus compare Himself to the wicked Archelaus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One explanation: as we have mentioned, Jesus’ parables often have flawed protagonists.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the lessons is “if a flawed human can do good things (like reward high-producing servants), how much more will perfect God do those things.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another possible explanation: for context, note He said these things as he was going up to Jerusalem.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He knew, but the disciples did not, that He will be rejected and hated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While we believers, do not view Jesus as an evil ruler, non-believers do not share our opinions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For our purposes, we can include the Jerusalem religious establishment in the category of non-believers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this respect, Jesus was hated just like this ruler was.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, in this second interpretation, the parable’s meaning is that judgment awaits those who oppose the kingdom.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If our image of Jesus is as a blonde-haired Scandinavian who goes around the shores of the Sea of Galilee patting children on the head, we may find these words startling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those people have never read the last few chapters of Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Jesus comes again, His enemies will be put down, and God wins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we said above about the “Journey” parables, Jesus’ first-coming, as well as His second-coming, are in view. Although they are “successful” at having Jesus cast aside, in about 40 years, the Romans will invade and slaughter the residents of Jerusalem. Those who survive are sent into exile. Either way, judgment awaits those who reject the rightful ruler. Jesus is also possibly dropping another hint that the Messianic political Kingdom will wait.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
As mentioned, Aubrey Taylor, writing in the “Lexham Geographic Commentary,” believes Luke’s version is not merely a retelling of Matthew’s Parable of the Talents. “When the setting of the parable is accounted for, it becomes clear Jesus is delivering a critique of exploitative power structures—not celebrating them as a model of discipleship.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument is compelling, so I submit it here for Acts 17:11 analysis. Also, perhaps both interpretations are valid. Parables usually only have one meaning, but they don’t always have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view hinges on the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;comparing the ruler in the parable(s) to Herod Archelaus, not Jesus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the too good to be true returns on investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the geographic setting: Jericho, in view of Herod’s palaces, on the way up to Jerusalem, where the Messianic Kingdom will NOT be initiated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the context of Zacchaeus repenting and refunding (with damages) his ill-gotten wealth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parable begins with a nobleman going into a far country to receive his kingdom, which Archelaus did a few years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above, we asked, “Why would Jesus compare Himself to the wicked Archelaus?” Taylor argues that He would not and did not intend to make that comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the economy of that day, “the very act of doing business for profit was considered immoral, the profit margins presented by the first to servants were downright evil.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike today’s economy, where a rising tide lifts all boats, it was seen as zero-sum in that day. If one person gained, that means another person lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In that culture, the nobleman would have been the villain, and the third slave would have been the hero!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The speculation is that the first two slaves would have had to resort to harassment and thievery to generate those massive returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m sympathetic to this view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even today, if someone showed those percentages of returns, we likely would assume that there were some shenanigans; perhaps the asset manager received an insider-trading tip or something like that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Taylor’s view, it was the third slave who acted honorably.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He did not lose any part of the initial investment. He wrapped it in a cloth for safekeeping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He did not directly disobey the wicked ruler, but he didn’t do anything to help him either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, in the fourth century, Eusebius referenced yet another version of the parable (in the now lost Gospel of the Nazarenes) where the third servant was &lt;strong&gt;rewarded&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taylor sees this interpretation as more fitting in the context of following the story of Zacchaeus, who gave away his ill-gotten earnings with Luke 19:11.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As they heard these things, he proceeded to tell a parable because he was near to Jerusalem and &lt;strong&gt;because they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, they wanted a national kingdom to replace Rome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to this view, &lt;strong&gt;Jesus responds that it would be absurd to establish the kingdom of God based on the model of Rome&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the first century, Israel’s recent history bore this out.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewish people rightly celebrate Hanukkah (as did Jesus Himself in John 10:22), where a group of rebels defeated the tyrannical Greek Seleucid empire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet only a few decades later, Israel’s own rulers, the Hasmoneans, showed themselves to be just as ruthless, inept, and just as corrupt as their Greek counterparts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In later centuries, Church history proved this as well.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taylor’s argument appeals to me because I give the most weight to what the original audience would have understood.   * What they would have understood is likely what Jesus meant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus would show us there&amp;rsquo;s going to be a different way.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He will enter Jerusalem not on a conquering horse but a humble donkey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“But, amid the crowds calling out for a king and a rescuer, He must have realized his message was falling on deaf ears.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll look at that entry in Lesson 39.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this said, the similarities of this parable to Matthew 25 can’t be ignored. The context of Matthew’s parable is a “good and faithful servant who enters into his master’s rest.” Luke’s parable is almost identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, while they appear conflicting, the two interpretations are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  In any case, we need to stay focus on kingdom work and not become complacent while Jesus is &amp;ldquo;away&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More applicable than the parable is we need to have the heart of Zacchaeus. We need to joyfully make it right when we are wrong because salvation has come to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lesson is titled “The Triumphal Entry” because we have finally arrived at the most significant week in all human history. The next seven days are a roller coaster of emotions, ending on the highest peak of all, the Resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 39 will be in two parts. Part I will review the Ascent of Adummim, which connects Jericho to Jerusalem. We’ll meet up with Jesus and the recently resurrected Lazarus in Bethany, look at how Jesus procures a donkey for his entry into Jerusalem, and examine the crowd’s reaction as they welcomed Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction-the-final-week-begins&#34;&gt;Introduction: The Final Week Begins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note about the “Final Week” – We are “only” in John chapters 11 and 12, so the last ten chapters of John deal with this week and post-resurrection. Lancaster&amp;rsquo;s commentary is a five-volume set. Each volume has around 400 pages. The Triumphal entry occurs about ½ way into volume 4. In other words, even though it looks like we’re nearing the end from a timeline perspective, we have a LOT of Gospel still ahead of us. Our format will take another 14 lessons to cover the events in the eight calendar days between Palm Sunday and Resurrection Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is undoubtedly the most influential and most personally significant week in all of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Luke 19:28&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And when he had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;these things&amp;rdquo; are the Minas and the King&amp;rsquo;s Returning parables we studied in Lesson 38.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/c4203840c06c77de695a847ff7bbc559.png&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photo&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; shows the ancient path that led the 18 miles (29 km) up from Jericho to Jerusalem. One always goes “up to Jerusalem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/2bafbd3f9ccec62efdf0eaf9ce825b36.png&#34; width=&#34;75%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chart comes from AD Riddle&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and shows Herod’s palace, Jericho, to Jerusalem. Presumably, the -720 is from the Herodian Palaces, west of the modern city and slightly higher. Modern Jericho’s height is listed at -864 feet, making it the lowest and the oldest continuously inhabited city on Earth. Today much of the Kidron valley has been filled in, so the elevation difference between that and Jerusalem is not as significant. Still, one had to be in excellent physical shape to make this trek. Today we do it in an air-conditioned bus with Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginning of the Following the Messiah episode 8 has an excellent segment about this ascent. Watch through 8:55.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8UaThqyEBzc&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;will-he-come-to-the-feast&#34;&gt;Will he come to the feast?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 11:55-57&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;55 Now, the Passover of the Ioudaioi was at hand, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves.   56 They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, “What do you think? That he will not come to the feast at all?”   57 Now, the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, he should let them know so that they might arrest him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the week leading up to Passover, Jerusalem would swell with Pilgrims. By some estimates, a population of perhaps a few hundred thousand could swell to 2-3 million. This helps explain several dynamics, most notably why the city&amp;rsquo;s leadership (both the Romans and the temple establishment) might be more on edge. It also makes locating one person in that crowd a non-trivial task.Ceremonial purification could take up to a week, especially if that person had come into contact with a corpse (Numbers 19). The Jewish Sages applied those same standards to any Jew living in a foreign country – gentile nations are inherently unclean. Remember this point when we get to Acts. This notion of ceremonial uncleanliness has a lot to do with the disciples&amp;rsquo; attitudes and reticence concerning dining with non-Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were looking for Jesus, meaning the people were wondering whether He would claim his Messianic title. The Passover/Feast of Unleavened bread was compulsory, so it would be very unusual for Him not to show up, especially since He only had to travel a relatively short distance from Galilee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public didn’t realize that “the game’s afoot,” as Sherlock Holmes might say. The Jerusalem &amp;ldquo;deep state&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot; had already decreed that Jesus needed to be taken out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;A Passover Seder&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/7f5926edfba1e6038c96b7bb867e4ffd.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get a chance to participate in a Passover Seder, you should take advantage of it. It is rich with Symbolism and Biblical history. Christians/Messianic Jews see additional symbolism that represents Jesus. For example, there are traditionally three pieces of Matzah wafers. The way it is baked, it has holes (like saltine crackers) and stripes. He was pierced for our iniquities, and his stripes heal us. Additionally, the 2nd of the three pieces is literally broken and “hidden” away until after the meal. Most Jews will tell you they don’t know why this is. Christians may have a better idea as this speaks of Jesus&amp;rsquo; Resurrection, where He is absent for a time, and we await rejoining Him at the Marriage Supper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note Jesus and other 1st Century Jews did not celebrate the Passover the way Jewish people observe the festival today. However, the Last Supper accounts in the Gospels record several themes and practices with today’s Passover Seder. The use of the Seder plate is a post-biblical tradition, but it serves as a helpful illustration of the traditional observance of the festival. Today’s traditional Seder plate includes a shank bone (replaced above with a piece of chicken), charoset (brown mixture), bitter herbs (lettuce), bitter herbs (parsley), egg, and a vegetable. The letters in the center of the plate are Pei Samech Chet (Hebrew is read from right to left). This spells Pesach. In many non-English countries, Easter goes by the name of Pesach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Precise dating of this week is difficult&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 12:1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1** Six days before the Passover, Jesus, therefore, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.**&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John 12:1, dating these events in the final week is a problem. We are not told precisely what year all this went down, so we must do our best with what we know. Some scholars believe this is 32 CE/AD because of a prophecy in Daniel 9, which we will discuss in Part II. Other scholars land on 33 or 30 CE/AD because, in these years, the date of the Passover meal would have been on a Thursday with his crucifixion on a Friday. There is strong traditional evidence that the crucifixion was on a Friday, but some scholars are not convinced. We will have to save this discussion for a later lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even here in John 12:1, while most scholars believe John meant six days before Nissan 14, the Passover sacrifice, some believe he told six days before Nissan 15, the Passover meal ushering in the seven-day feast of unleavened bread.  This is further complicated by John&amp;rsquo;s placing the perfume anointing story six days before the Passover, while Mark says it was two-days before.  There is some suggestion John may have been using a different calendar than the Synoptic Gospel writers, but that may not fully explain the perfume discrepancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If none of these dating discrepancies bothers you and you don’t care because you’re just glad Jesus died for your sins and rose again, you’re probably much better off than the rest of us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lazarus-causes-ioudaioi-to-believe-in-jesus&#34;&gt;Lazarus causes &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; to believe in Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 12:9-11&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9 When the large crowd of the &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; learned that Jesus was there, they came, not only on account of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. 10 So the chief priests made plans to put Lazarus to death as well, 11 because on account of him, many of the &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; were going away and believing in Jesus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been said that Lazarus was first DEAD before Jesus. He was in a state where he could do nothing to help himself. He needed Jesus. Then there was a period where he was symbolically DEFEATED. Although he had been raised, he was still in his grave clothes. This is symbolic of the Christian who has been saved but can’t or won’t let go of past “stuff” holding them back. Then once he got rid of his grave clothes, he was DANGEROUS, so much so that the deep state wanted him taken out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are getting specific, note that John says it wasn’t even the entire temple establishment that wanted Lazarus gone; it was a much smaller subgroup of the chief priests. The number of conspirators against Jesus might have been MUCH more minor than we might otherwise imagine. I’m sure Lazarus had quite a story to tell, but we remember that in Luke 16:31, Jesus said that even if one comes back from the dead, many would still not be persuaded.Just a reminder, when reading the Gospel of John, when we read “the Jews,” we need to avoid automatically inferring “the bad guys.” John is very imprecise with some of his terms. The Ioudaioi in verses 9 and 11 are clearly on the side of Jesus. Here we have a POTENTIAL ambiguity. Are these Ioudaioi the everyday commonfolk Jews, or could John also say that many of the TEMPLE ESTABLISHMENT Ioudaioi came to believe in Jesus? THAT second possibility would rattle the chief priests. We don’t know, but it’s fun speculation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Mat 21:1-3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mar 11:1-3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luk 19:29-31&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joh 12:12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Now when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;2 saying to them, “Go into the village in front of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;3 If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and he will send them at once.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Now when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;2 and said to them, “Go into the village in front of you, and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;3 If anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.’”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;29 When he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;30 saying, “Go into the village in front of you, where on entering you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever yet sat. Untie it and bring it here.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;31 If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you shall say this: ‘The Lord has need of it.’”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark and Luke note “a donkey on which no one has ever sat – according to Lancaster, Animals used for many Jewish rituals had to be pure. This includes being without blemish and never being ridden or yoked. Lancaster also draws a parallel with Jesus’ tomb in which no one had previously lain.As donkeys are notorious for being wild and difficult to break, the fact that Jesus walked up, mounted, and rode without being bucked could potentially be another miracle. It might also explain why it took two disciples to fetch the animal. Unbroken donkeys are also supposedly attached to their mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photo by Dr. Bolen&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; shows the journey from Bethany, through Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives. Jesus didn’t only make this journey on Palm Sunday. He spent a lot of time with Lazarus, Mary, and Martha. This aerial perspective shows the route that Jesus probably took MANY mornings as He walked from Bethany to Jerusalem. In addition to beginning the Palm Sunday walk, one of the things we do when we go there is remember that Jesus also ascended from the Mount of Olives (Acts 1:9-12). We also tend to want to look up to the sky. Zechariah 14:4 says, “His feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east”…The somewhat adjacent Bethphage churches mark the typical starting point for a Palm Sunday procession. Since it’s about a 15-minute walk from Bethphage to the summit of the Mount of Olives, tours like the one I did begin at an overlook on the Mount of Olives near the Ascension church.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Did Jesus prophesy regarding the donkey?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/9aed9aa5c1d2045b2e8c5dbbf23fc17c.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This donkey was photographed while running loose on the Greek Orthodox compound at Bethphage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars are conflicted about whether Jesus’ instructions represent a prophecy with a relatively quick miraculous fulfillment, a logical forecast given the attitudes towards hospitality in that day, or whether this was some pre-arranged code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster argues for a miracle by noting the amount of space the gospel writers spend on it. If it was prearranged or expected, he theorizes the evangelists probably would have merely written, “they brought Jesus a donkey.” None of the gospels mention a pre-arranged signal, yet that didn’t stop people from bringing forth that theory. It’s intriguing, but there is little evidence for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener makes an argument for the hospitality theory “the donkey’s owner probably saw it as helpful hospitality to a famous rabbi.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, as we mentioned on the previous slide, Jesus spent a lot of time in this area. It makes sense that He would know where to find a donkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, saying,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;5 “Say to the daughter of Zion, ‘Behold, your king is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.’”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;6 The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;7 They brought the donkey and the colt and put on them their cloaks, and he sat on them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street, and they untied it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;5 And some of those standing there said to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;6 And they told them what Jesus had said, and they let them go.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;7 And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it, and he sat on it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32 So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;33 And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;34 And they said, “The Lord has need of it.”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;35 And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their cloaks on the colt, they set Jesus on it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14 And Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;15 “Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your king is coming, sitting on a donkey&amp;rsquo;s colt!”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;16 His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and had been done to him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the 9th of 10 prophecies by Matthew where he writes, “this took place to fulfill…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of His ministry, Jesus did not permit anyone to speak of His kingship. His usual response was “my hour has not yet come.” Then on this day, as Chuck Missler liked to say, “He not only permitted it, he arranged it.” As Lancaster writes, “Sending for a donkey…indicated a shift in public policy. He was ready to declare to Israel that He was her long-awaited Messiah-King.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;Lancaster notes that just about every donkey reference in the Hebrew Bible prefigures Messiah: from Genesis 22 and Abraham’s near-sacrifice of Isaac to Jacob’s donkey in Genesis 32 to Moses in Exodus 4 and so on. The Talmud records, “In the same way, the latter redeemer will come, as it is stated, “Humble and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Why not on a horse?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much is made of the fact that Jesus rode in on a lowly donkey when we might expect a king to ride in on a horse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prevailing theory by many Protestant commentators is the crowd should have known by the donkey that Jesus wasn’t going to be a conquering king this time. In his SECOND coming, he arrives on a horse. Revelation 19:11-16.  They imply that because Jesus entered on a donkey he was not coming as a king but as a servant to lay His life down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is half correct and half incorrect.  They are correct that a donkey signaled that He came in peace. Those in the crowd who expected a political, conquering King should have seen the sign.  They are incorrect that the donkey signaled He was not entering as a king.  The key word is &amp;ldquo;conquering.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lizorkin-Eisenberg notes that “when a city welcomed a victor with open arms WITHOUT an exercise of power, it was expected that the victor would enter on a donkey and not on a horse.”  Lizorkin-Eyzenberg says Revelation 19 still fits this model –At that point in the future, the world is being judged, and the people do not accept Christ willingly. So He comes as a conqueror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, BOTH times, he comes as a King; once in peace on a donkey; but the second as a conqueror in judgment on a horse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare Solomon, the &amp;ldquo;son of David,&amp;rdquo; assuming his throne on a donkey in 1 Kings 1:33.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they had accepted Him when He came in peace, there would have been no need for Him to return in judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allenby observes protocol in 1917&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the British General Allenby was preparing to take control of Jerusalem after world war I, on December 11, 1917, he rode his horse up to the Jaffa Gate on the west side of the city. He abruptly dismounted and entered the city on foot. The official record is that he did so out of respect for the holy city. He realized he was the first Christian in over 700 years to control Jerusalem, a city claimed by three faith traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also made this humble entry as an intentional or unintentional contrast to the German Kaiser Wilhelm II’s very pompous entry 20 years earlier (the Kaiser had part of the wall near the Jaffa Gate removed so his entourage could fit through). There is a legend that, privately, Allenby supposedly told one of his aides something like, “only one Man is qualified to enter this city on horseback, and that is not me.” That’s cool if it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 Most of the crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;9 And the crowds that went before him and that followed him were shouting, “Hosanna to the &lt;mark&gt;Son of David&lt;/mark&gt;! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 And many spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches that they had cut from the fields.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;9 And those who went before and those who followed were shouting, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;10 Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father, &lt;mark&gt;David&lt;/mark&gt;! Hosanna in the highest!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;36 And as he rode along, they spread their cloaks on the road.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;37 As he was drawing near—already on the way down the Mount of Olives—the whole multitude of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;38 saying, “Blessed is &lt;mark&gt;the King&lt;/mark&gt; who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13 So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying out, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the &lt;mark&gt;King of Israel&lt;/mark&gt;!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Whose King?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Matthew and Mark have the crowd referencing “son of David” while John says explicitly, “King of Israel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’ve occasionally noted in our series, Dr. Lizorkin-Eyzenberg believes John’s audience is writing to non-Judean Israelites, including the Samaritans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Samaritans did not care, let alone think, that their messiah would be a son of David. John wanted his audience to know that Jesus is KING OF ALL ISRAEL!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we indulge a thought that the four Gospels in some way could represent the pattern of spreading the good news in Acts 1:8. In that case, we could say that Matthew and Mark were writing to Jerusalem and all Judea (Jews) – Jews would be interested in the Messiah being a &lt;em&gt;son of David&lt;/em&gt;. Keener notes that during the Passover, which celebrates the deliverance of Israel from the house of bondage, “hopes for the restoration of the Davidic kingdom ran high.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John was writing to Samaria (and other non-Jews who believed in Israel’s God, though not necessarily through the tribe of Judah) – they wouldn’t care about being a son of David, but to them, Messiah is &lt;em&gt;king over all Israel&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke, a Gentile convert, was writing to the ends of the earth, the extent of the Roman empire. His audience wouldn’t care about a son of David or a king of Israel but simply needs to know that &lt;em&gt;Jesus is King&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern pilgrims carry palm branches in an annual reenactment of the Palm Sunday journey of Jesus&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we might miss, but the crowd in Jerusalem that day certainly knew, is that they viewed Jesus as their liberator against the corrupt Temple establishment and the Roman occupiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They reenacted the events in 1st Maccabees where a different group of Jews made a similar triumphal entry into Jerusalem after the successful revolt against the Greeks and Antiochus IV in 164 BC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the crowds going before Him, and those who followed, were shouting, “Hosanna . . . .”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosannah is a Hebrew phrase Hoshia Nah that means Save us now or save us, please. Hoshia is in the same word family as Yeshua, Salvation.“Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the LORD&amp;quot; comes from Psalm 118:25-6. Psalms 113-128 are known as Hallel Psalms. Lancaster notes that in its original 1st Temple usage, Psalm 118 celebrated a Judean King’s return from battle. Ever since, Jewish tradition held that Psalm 118 would herald the messianic redemption. The Talmud mentions explicitly that the waving of palm branches accompanies the singing of the Hallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was unmistakable what the crowd was communicating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a lot less crowded when Sarah and I did the Palm Sunday walk. Oddly enough, this is a busy street. Periodically we’d have to make way for a car. There was a car coming down and a car going up that had to navigate around each other at one point. That was entertaining.The man in the middle is Chuck Missler, who I frequently mention. This was in 2010, so he would have been about 75. Chuck had a tremendous impact on me and millions of others through his ministry. His unique background as a naval academy graduate and career as a secular executive before the transitioning to vocational ministry. I can’t say the transition to full-time ministry because his view is that we are ALL in the full-time ministry whether we know it or not. Chuck went to be with the Lord in 2018. Chuck taught me a love for God’s word and Israel. His arm is around my friend Peter from England and on his left is my friend Stuart from Australia. I know they have their backs to us, which breaks many rules of photography, but I still love and cherish this picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;39 And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples.”   40 He answered, “I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian commentaries typically see those self-righteous and, if I may say, “wascawy phawacees” at it again (many apologies to Elmer Fudd). If this is true, they ignored a fundamental tenet in the Art of War. Never interrupt your enemy when he is in the process of destroying himself. If I was Jesus&amp;rsquo; enemy (GOD FORBID!) I might have been inclined not to say anything and let him get in trouble with the Romans for inciting an insurrection.Keener noted at Mark 11:1 that had the Roman garrison recognized the implications the crowd was making; they probably would have arrested him. Lancaster writes, “even those Pharisees who may have hoped the acclamations were true understood the grave political danger they were in by such an open proclamation. They feared for Yeshua’s life.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; You decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either case, Jesus&amp;rsquo; reply says it all. Whereas before he said, “my time has not yet come,” He now says that creation can&amp;rsquo;t keep silent any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re probably wondering what this has to do with &amp;ldquo;the cheapest souvenir in Israel.&amp;rdquo; Unfortunately, a trip to Israel is not inexpensive. It’s been said that the best way to leave Israel with a small fortune is to enter Israel with a large fortune.But there is one free item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the stones that didn&amp;rsquo;t cry out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/IMG_1037.JPG&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m indebted to Chuck Missler for this tip. As you walk down the Palm Sunday Road, look for a rock. This has been more difficult since they paved the road a few years back, but there are still some spots where you can find them. Of course, it’s essential to make sure you aren’t disturbing anything that’s been intentionally put there, like landscaping or stones of remembrance at gravesites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you see one, pick it up. Then when you get home, and people ask you what it is, you can say, “that’s one of the stones that didn’t cry out. You know, from Luke 19:40?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they look at you puzzled, this allows you to dig into the passage where Jesus allows the people to proclaim him King, and he doesn’t stop them. Jesus here is proclaiming Himself to be the Messiah. From here, if your person is a non-believer, you can give them CS Lewis’ line about how He’s either lying, or he’s a lunatic, or if it’s neither one of those, he must be telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Part II, we will look at the remainder of the day, including Jesus weeping over Jerusalem and issuing a prophecy about the destruction of the city.  It&amp;rsquo;s a prophecy that , today, we can reach out, touch, and know it is fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Sunday mornings, we are leading a verse-by-verse study through the book of Genesis.  Every lesson will have a video that focuses on the cultural, historical, and geographic background of the passage followed by a live teaching. &lt;strong&gt;New content is produced every week.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
