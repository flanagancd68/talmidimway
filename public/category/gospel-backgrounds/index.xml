&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospels are Jewish documents. 1st Century “Christianity” was a Jewish sect.
John is often viewed as contrasting the correct way of Christianity with the incorrect way of Judaism, but this represents what is called an anachronistic fallacy, often shortened to “Anachronism” - misappropriation of concepts and ideas in time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often see anachronisms in period piece movies.  Someone will be wearing a digital watch in a movie set in the 18th century.  at the 1955 enchantment under the sea dance, Marty McFly is playing a 1958 gibson guitar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a challenge to restrain our own presuppositions, our set of established beliefs, when we read the Bible.  It is natural to assume a biblical speaker to affirm our presuppositions in order to justify our positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overarching anachronistic fallacy Many commentators commit is to take what is called “the parting of the ways” between Judaism and Christianity that occurred much later (2nd-4th centuries CE) and reading it back into this text in the 1st century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, since it had not occurred yet, there is absolutely no way John or any other biblical writer could have the split between Judaism and Christianity in view when they were writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called eisegesis - reading into the text.  Modern conservative scholars would all agree that eisegesis is bad yet many of them do it almost automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we strive for is EXEGESIS, understanding the text IN CONTEXT to extract what the author was saying.  To do this, we must first realize the gospels are Jewish documents written within a historical context of 2nd Temple Judaism.  The audience were Jewish Christ followers together with many non-Jews who had joined a Jewish sect..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early church fathers affirmed John’s authorship of this Gospel strongly and unanimously. Some of the fathers claim to have personally known those who knew John in Ephesus in his later years, thus making a direct link to the tradition of Johannine authorship. The evangelist John is shown here with the symbol of an eagle, the one of the four living creatures which is traditionally associated with him (Ezekiel 1:5-10 and Revelation 4:6-7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-11&#34;&gt;John 1:1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logos in the normal sense means “word or speech”.  In this prologue, John uses it in the mystical sense.  He alludes directly to the beginning of the Torah and the beginning of creation.  He starts this with an intentional allusion to Genesis 1:1 “In the beginning”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-12-6&#34;&gt;John 1:2-6&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. 6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall the first act of Creation. “and God said Let there be Light, and there was light.”&lt;br&gt;
In verse 4  John declares that this life had always been available through God’s word, which is the same word that he identifies with Jesus (IVP). 
In John 1:5, The divine light from the first day of creation shines once again into the dark world of man, signifying a new creation (COM)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John
Excavations in the early 2000s revealed this cave west of Jerusalem near Ein Kerem. Archaeologist Shimon Gibson identified it with the ministry of John the Baptist on the basis of a stick-figure drawing of a man inside the cave. Gibson’s theory was published in The Cave of John the Baptist (Doubleday, 2004).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For responses, see that by James F. Strange (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/reviews/the-cave-of-john-the-baptist/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/reviews/the-cave-of-john-the-baptist/&lt;/a&gt;) and Todd Bolen (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bibleplaces.com/cave-of-john-the-baptist/%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://www.bibleplaces.com/cave-of-john-the-baptist/)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the writing of the church father Origen (AD 185-254), the location of John’s baptizing at Bethany beyond the Jordan has been located at a point near the river opposite Jericho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-17&#34;&gt;John 1:7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;7  He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some scholars note that John has a “legal” feel.  As you read John&amp;rsquo;s gospel, be on the lookout for the terms Witness, Testimony, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, John is interested not only in establishing Jesus’ credentials, he is also interested in “convicting” the corrupt Jerusalem establishment on the grounds of usurption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/01-the_logos_files/01.Picture7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;30%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discovered in Cave 4 of Qumran in the early 1950s, this text contains five biblical verses that focused on the coming of the Messiah. This artifact was photographed in the Amman Museum.&lt;br&gt;
A few scholars suspect John may have been part of the Essene sect, but in any case he was definitely influenced by them.  The Essenes believed that the forces controlling Jerusalem and the Temple were usurpers and priests of darkness.  They juxtaposed darkness and light just as John does throughout his writings.   “in the Dead Sea Scrolls, the forces of light and darkness were engaged in mortal combat, but light was predestined to triumph” (IVP)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-18-13&#34;&gt;John 1:8-13&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;8 He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light. 9 The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. 11 He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. 12 But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, 13 who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is spiritual rebirth, not ethnic descent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerusalem was the home of David and place where his greater Son was appointed to rule over the nation.  John uses a term Ioudaioi, which get’s translated as “jews” but many scholars believe this is too generic.  Think of the term “Americans” -The Americans won the Gold medal in 1980 (a group of 20 hockey players).  The Americans invaded Normandy (those members of the Army and the Navy in June 1944).  The Americans imposed Tariffs on China (specifically referring to the Government).  The Americans pay their taxes on April 15 (most Americans but not all - children don’t pay taxes).  The Americans are guaranteed freedoms under the Constitution (all Americans)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the term &amp;ldquo;Jews&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot; could be anywhere from All Jews - which we know is not in view here because the 1st Century church was nearly 100% Jewish.   Unfortunately many commentators, view it as exactly this: John is an early Christian Anti-Jewish document.  It is more likely that what is in view is not rejection by all-Israel, but rather rejection by a sub-group within Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What might some of these sub-groups be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could maybe refer those in Judea who generally rejected as opposed to those in Galilee where Jesus was largely accepted. But even here, not all Judeans rejected him.  Nicodemus for example.  Several scholars believe Ioudaoi specifically refers to the ruling establishment, which for the most part wanted Jesus out of the picture.  Again Nicodemus is an exception and there were probably others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many commentaries place the blame on all Israel, which could be painting with too broad of a brush.  It would be like holding all 300 million Americans responsible for something done by a small group of corrupt politicians in Washington DC.  With that said, a national guilt might also be in view- America is a sinful and unrepentant nation, even though many Americans do repent of their sin.  Deuteronomy 9:23 states, “You rebelled against the command of the LORD your God; you neither believed Him nor listened to His voice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, we must allow God to own the business of judgment.   it is wrong to use our holy book to specifically condemn a group of people (as the church as done to Jews for the last 2000 years).  We are to love our neighbors and pray for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish thought of the day was that to be a true Child of God, one had to be a Child of Abraham, either through birth or conversion (even today, Ben Avraham is a common name a gentile takes when converting to Judaism).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John is setting the stage that it is not ethnic affiliation but spiritual rebirth that matters.  A topic that will be developed in John Chapter 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-114-15&#34;&gt;John 1:14-15&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;14  And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. 15  (John bore witness about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A father’s only son” would remind readers of Genesis 22, where God instructed Abraham “take your son, your only son whom you love, Isaac&amp;hellip;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://talmidimway.com/commentary/gospels/01-the_logos_files/01.Picture8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:left&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The star in the Church of Nativity in Bethlehem marks the spot where tradition says that Mary gave birth to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the Greek mind, the invisible spiritual real is far superior to the earthly realm.  However, God created man spirit and flesh.  Our flesh only became corrupt AFTER the fall.  God intended there to be a union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verb translated above as “dwelt” (skenoo) is related to the Greek word for “tabernacle” (skene). Just as God dwelt with his people in the tabernacle, so the Word tabernacled with his people in the incarnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-11618&#34;&gt;John 1:16:18&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;16 For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. 17 For (as) the (Torah) was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 18 No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father&amp;rsquo;s side, he has made him known.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 17 is often translated “for the law came through Moses &lt;em&gt;BUT&lt;/em&gt; Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “BUT” is a mistranslation (possibly intentional) - it is not in the Greek.  John just got through saying that Jesus was there in the beginning.  This means Grace and Truth where there in the beginning.  The Law has a special role to play for the nation of Israel but it is not in any way antithetical to the Gospel of Jesus.  John sees Jesus as affirming the covenant promises God made in the Torah.  A better reading might be “for AS the Torah was given through Moses, Grace and Truth came through Jesus Christ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “but” originally occurred in the King James Version.  The anachronistic error here involves the 16th Century division between Protestants and Catholics regarding the function of the law in the life of the believer.  One of the Reformation cries was “Faith alone”.  It wasn’t until Luther that “Law” and “Grace” became opposites.  Superimposing this view on the Biblical Text is simply not correct.  The oppose of Law is lawlessness.  The oppose of grace is disgrace.  It is wrong to view any part of the Bible as lawless or disgraceful!  God’s Law is a good and beautiful thing.  Read Psalm 119!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;study-questions&#34;&gt;Study Questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can anachronisms and eisegesis be a problem in my studies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways does John 1:1-5 parallel Genesis 1 and how does that change my thinking of Genesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I think “His own” in verse 11 refers to all Jews?  Why or why not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did my opinionAs I reflect on the “tabernacle” discussion in John 1:14, how does (or how should) this affect my walk with Jesus?
change after this lesson?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did my understanding of the Law/Old Testament change after studying 1:17?  How can I apply this going forward?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rich, young ruler asks Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life. Jesus says to keep the commandments, sell everything, and follow Him. The man went away sad for he had great wealth. Jesus says it is only through God that a rich man can enter the Kingdom. He then tells His disciples that their sacrifices for the Kingdom will be rewarded.  Jesus then tells the parable of the hired workers where the owner pays workers who only worked about an hour the same as those who worked all day, causing the later group to grumble.  Jesus again predicts his demise at Jerusalem and says the disciples will also drink his Cup of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are continuing the journey up to Jerusalem for the final Passover.  Matthew 20 likely takes place somewhere near Jericho.
&lt;img src=&#34;images/map.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Map of Judea and Perea&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they passed through Jericho, there would have been agricultural fields and one of Herod the Great&amp;rsquo;s palaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Matthew 19, Jesus tells his talmidim that those who left their fields will receive their rewards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Matthew 20, Jesus tells a parable about a man who owned a vineyard and needed workers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later, he will tell His talmidim that once they get to Jerusalem, He will be turned over to the gentiles and the leaders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not too much of a stretch to envision Jesus telling these stories as he passes near and references these geographic markers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 19&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Luke 18&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;16  And behold, a man came up to him, saying, “Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;17  And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;18  And a ruler asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we meet a man who tends to get the back of the hand from commentators. This treatment may be justified but perhaps not for the typical reasons offered.  Let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can dig deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;rsquo;s accentuate the positives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note the man RAN to meet Jesus and showed a high degree of respect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He assumed the resurrection - we take this for granted, but it was not necessarily a decided issue back then (Pharisees vs. Sadducees)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He likely asked other rabbis but was told he&amp;rsquo;s in the club because he&amp;rsquo;s Jewish.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_Potentially, something about this answer didn&amp;rsquo;t satisfy him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He was a diligent Bible student and attempted to be obedient to the commands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most importantly, he CAME TO JESUS!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when he asks, &amp;ldquo;What must I do?&amp;rdquo;, this is our first &amp;ldquo;tell&amp;rdquo; that something is off is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will learn in a couple of verses that the man was well-versed in the Torah, yet, as Lancaster puts it, &amp;ldquo;The man had concluded that the words of the Bible we&amp;rsquo;re not adequate to assure him of the resurrection.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-do-you-call-me-good&#34;&gt;Why do you call me good?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 19&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Luke 18&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;17  And he said to him, “Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;18  And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;19  And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is behind Jesus&#39; initial reaction to being called &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He could be trying to get the young man to see that Jesus = God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps the man’s assuming Jesus had some special secret is the underlying motive by Jesus’ adverse reaction to calling him &amp;ldquo;good.“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps Jesus is saying, “Do not assume I have something to add to what God has already said.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Hebrew, the phrase would be HaTov הַטּוֹב, &amp;ldquo;the good” or “the good one”.  This  is one of the Hebrew names for God.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observant Jews do not pronounce the Covenant Holy Name of God (the &amp;ldquo;Tetragramaton&amp;rdquo; - four letters) out of respect.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They typically will say &amp;ldquo;Adonai&amp;rdquo; (Lord) if in a religious setting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They will say &amp;ldquo;HaShem&amp;rdquo; (the Name), or another name like &amp;ldquo;HaTov&amp;rdquo; if in a less formal context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no recorded instance of Jesus using the Covenantal Name of God, but there are MANY examples where He uses a circumlocution, like He does here with &amp;ldquo;HaTov&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I recommend gentile Christians follow Jesus&#39; lead and use a name other than the Tetragramaton when referencing God the Father.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;keep-the-commandments&#34;&gt;Keep the commandments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 19&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Luke 18&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;17   If you would enter life, keep the commandments.”  18  He said to him, “Which ones?”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;19  You know the commandments:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;20  You know the commandments&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and mine ordinances; which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am Adonai” (Lev 18:5, ASV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus enhances and clarifies the Torah, but He does add to or subtract from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus here gives roughly the same answer Abraham gave in Luke 16.  &amp;ldquo;They have Moses and the prophets.“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, the Bible is sufficient and contains the words for eternal life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Mark and Luke, Jesus is affirming that the young man already has what he needs to know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rom 3:28 For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Jesus says, “if you would enter life, keep the commandments,” this seems to contradict Paul in Romans 3:28.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that Jesus does not comment on whether this man or any other man can keep the Law to the degree required to attain eternal life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s merely answering the question he was asked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the Law is perfect; it is my sin that makes the Law a problem. The law can justify; it is my sin that prevents me from fulfilling the terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course Jesus was able and willing to fulfill those terms on my behalf. He kept the Law perfectly and extended His righteousness to us.  So the Law DOES have the power for us to inherit eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next Jesus says elsewhere, &amp;ldquo;if you love Me, keep my commands.&amp;rdquo;  This means the Law is no longer a &amp;ldquo;got to&amp;rdquo;, but a &amp;ldquo;get to&amp;rdquo;.  We follow His commands as a thank-you gift back to Him to show him we love Him and are appreciative of what He has done for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite popular protestant theology, not once does Paul dismiss the value of keeping the Law and commandments as a part of living a righteous life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that one did not have to undergo a specific requirement of the Law, namely circumcision and becoming fully Jewish (as opposed to a gentile God-fearer) to merit salvation. That is not the same as saying the Law is wrong and that people shouldn&amp;rsquo;t TRY to keep it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t expect our kids to be perfect and follow our rules all the time; but we you enjoy it and appreciate it when they do.  Maybe we even expect it.  They times they break our rules should be a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Horizontal Commandments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 19&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Luke 18&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;18  And Jesus said, “You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness,  19  Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;19 ‘Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.’”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;‘Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.’”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Jesus neither lists all commandments nor ranks them in importance.  His general point is that the Torah is sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew includes loving your neighbor while Mark adds, do not defraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love your neighbor (Lev 19:18) is viewed as a summary of the horizontal commandments (those between individuals, or “humanward” as Keener styles it).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s interesting that Jesus only includes commandments from this category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love the Lord your God (Deut 6:5) summarizes the vertical/Godward commandments between the individual and God.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example. “you shall have no other gods before me” and “honor the Sabbath day” are &amp;ldquo;vertical&amp;rdquo; commandments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus does not list any of these, &lt;em&gt;yet these are exacyly the ones the young man is missing&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While &amp;ldquo;do not defraud&amp;rdquo; is not expressly a commandment, it is not too far-fetched to understand that the Torah never sections fraud.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I love my neighbor as myself, that prohibits any theft (including theft of my neighbor’s good name, i.e., gossip).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;all-these-i-have-kept&#34;&gt;All these I have kept&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 19&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Luke 18&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;20  The young man said to him, “All these I have kept. What do I still lack?”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;20  And he said to him, “Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;21  And he said, “All these I have kept from my youth.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Keener says that a “young” man could have been between 24 and 40 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The young ruler does not state that he kept the commandments with sinless perfection.&lt;br&gt;
Perhaps this is implied, but maybe it is not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus does not condemn the man for being self-righteous, nor does he attempt to correct the young man&amp;rsquo;s thinking that keeping the law could get him eternal life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener also noted that most Jewish people could claim to have kept the specific commandments mentioned.  This might explain Jesus’ non-reaction to his claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-loved-him&#34;&gt;Jesus Loved Him&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark 10:21  And Jesus, looking at him, loved him&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s interesting that many Christians are quick to condemn the rich young ruler, but here we&amp;rsquo;re told that Jesus loves him.  If we&amp;rsquo;re denigrating something or accusing someone Jesus loves, we might be on the wrong side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many of us would willingly volunteer to sell all our possessions?  I don’t think very many. It’s easy to point fingers when not looking into the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the subject of Jesus loving the young man, another Hebraic New Testament commentator, John Lightfoot, wrote, &amp;ldquo;This man pleased Jesus, both in his question and answer. He both earnestly inquired concerning attaining eternal life and seriously professed that he addicted himself to God&amp;rsquo;s Commandments with all care and circumspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;

    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;WAS MARK THE RICH YOUNG RULER?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only Mark records the statement about Jesus loving him.  This has led some to speculate that the rich young ruler might have been none other than Mark himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark 14:51-52 also mentions a young man who was with Jesus at Gethsemane
He was wearing nothing but a linen cloth. When the guards tried to seize him, all they got was the cloth, and he ran away naked. This, also, is only mentioned in Mark’s gospel.  Was this &amp;ldquo;young man&amp;rdquo; also Mark?  If both &amp;ldquo;young men&amp;rdquo; are actually the same Mark, this indicates that despite initially going away sad, he did eventually become a disciple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, in Acts 15:37-39 Barnabas wants to bring Mark along on a journey but Paul objects.
Evidently Mark bailed out on a prior occasion, so in Paul&amp;rsquo;s mind, he was unreliable.  The Greek implies that Paul and Barnabas nearly came to blows!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then near the end of Paul&amp;rsquo;s life, writing in 2 Timothy 4:11, Paul asks for Mark because he is &amp;ldquo;useful to me for ministry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We all have our ups and downs spiritually; but we need to be persistent and finish well like Mark.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sell-all-to-have-treasure-in-heaven&#34;&gt;Sell all to have treasure in heaven&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 19&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Luke 18&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;21  Jesus said to him, “If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” 22  When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;21  And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, “You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” 22  Disheartened by the saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;22  When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” 23  But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster notes a subtle nuance between the traditional view that the man was trying to earn his way into heaven by good works and what might have been the man&amp;rsquo;s underlying thought process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that culture, an outstanding charitable deed was a testimony of the character of one who performs it. In other words, acts of love and kindness express true repentance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might say that he asked (according to Matthew) or told (according to Mark and Luke) exactly how he could store up treasures in heaven, not to GET &amp;ldquo;saved&amp;rdquo;, but as a testimony that he already WAS &amp;ldquo;saved.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the phrase “you will have treasures in heaven, and come follow me” is included in all three accounts.  As we said earlier, we should obey His commandments and store up treasure in heaven BECAUSE we are saved; not to GET saved
With this in mind, I don’t think Jesus was being disingenuous or sarcastic in the slightest. Jesus gave the man a chance to become his disciple – to drop everything and follow Him.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, it was a severe and radical test Jesus was posing. Did the disciple value his “good” teacher over earthly possessions? Was he able to demonstrate his claim to love his neighbor as himself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man declined. The cost of following Jesus was just too high for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the text does not support that Jesus was establishing a mandate for all disciples. Many of his disciples were likely well to do. We looked at Mary, Martha, and Lazarus two lessons ago. From the descriptions, we can conclude that they were well-off&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, recall the accusation of Mary that she should have sold her perfume instead of using it to anoint Jesus; in that circumstance, Jesus said she had done a good thing. If the bar for discipleship was to sell everything, we can presume Jesus would have told Mary to sell the expensive perfume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did not ask Peter to sell his waterfront property and turn his family out on the street.
Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathea, and Mary Magdalene were all wealthy, yet they were never asked to sell everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with that said, Jesus identified the thing that had a hold on the young man&amp;rsquo;s life.  What things have a hold on our lives that Jesus would ask us to &amp;ldquo;sell&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell all to be perfect?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 19:21  Jesus said to him, “If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A casual reading might leave one with the impression that &amp;ldquo;the man asked, &amp;ldquo;What do I need to do to get into heaven?&amp;rdquo; Jesus replied, &amp;ldquo;sell everything, and you can get into heaven.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus saying this would have been antithetical to the gospel message, so (assuming our understanding of the Gospel message is correct), we can reject this conclusion. We can&amp;rsquo;t do anything on our own to merit salvation, including selling all our belongings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned that Jesus did not ask other disciples to sell everything, so Jesus was not establishing a condition for eternal life when he told the man to sell everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many commentators point out, and I agree that Jesus was highlighting the man&amp;rsquo;s covetousness in this instance. His affluence, or more specifically, his RELIANCE ON and ATTACHMENT TO his wealth, made it impossible to walk after Yeshua in the way of discipleship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after chewing on this, my interpretation is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The young man was asking for a good deed that would reflect his character and repentant heart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus replies, “in your case, such a deed that would demonstrate your repentance would be for you to sell everything and become my disciple.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The man concluded he could not part with his wealth and be obedient to Jesus in discipleship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This revealed that the man actually did &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; keep all the commands because he didn&amp;rsquo;t love his poor neighbors as much as he loved himself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Jesus was telling him he had to pick one master to serve, and he made his choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as you can see, this is a much more complex question than a Jew thinking he can earn his salvation and Jesus sternly correcting his legalistic mindset.  I suspect that Jesus was as sad as the man who went away sad. When someone you love makes a poor decision, it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember our premise: every person Jesus interacts with is in some sense you and me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could be keeping or hindering us from effective discipleship? In what ways is Jesus asking you and me to demonstrate that we only serve him and not the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For us, the question may not be, &amp;ldquo;what percentage (up to 100%) should I give?&amp;rdquo; But &amp;ldquo;how much more can I give?“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener has an excellent take-away:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The kingdom is not meant to be an extra blessing tagged onto a comfortable life; it must be all-consuming, or it is no longer the kingdom. For that reason, it appeals more readily to those with less to lose.” – Craig Keener&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;23  And Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. 24  Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;23  And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How difficult it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!” 24  And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, “Children, how difficult it is to enter the kingdom of God! 25  It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;24  Jesus, seeing that he had become sad, said, “How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! 25  For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the story about pushing a camel through &amp;lsquo;Eye of the Needle&amp;rsquo; gate in Jerusalem true?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/mat04998.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;eye of the needle&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:left&#34;/&gt;
There&#39;s a story that is often told in conjunction with this passage.  One of the gates in Jerusalem&#39;s walls had a small door that would let only pedestrians through after the main gate was closed at night.  If one had a packed camel, the only way to get the camel through was to remove all the tack and supplies, have the animal get on its knees, then shove it through the small opening.  Conveniently, so the story goes, this small door had the nickname, &#34;the eye of the needle&#34; and therefore, this is what Jesus was referring to in order to illustrate the extreme difficulty of a camel going through the eye of the needle.
&lt;p&gt;While in many circumstances, we can glean a lot from studying the first century context (in general this is precisely the point of talmidimway.org); however, there is one problem.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This story is simply not true&lt;/em&gt;.  There is no historical or archeological evidence for a gate known as the &amp;ldquo;eye of the needle&amp;rdquo; in the 1st Century. It&amp;rsquo;s an urban legend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, it misses the point entirely. The story would have us think that a man, with great effort (like it takes to push a camel through a small space), can enter the kingdom.  He was using an expression, similar to &amp;ldquo;when pigs fly&amp;rdquo; in English.  It defies the laws of physics.  It&amp;rsquo;s never going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus first says it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;difficult&amp;rdquo; for a wealthy person to enter, but then He says, &amp;ldquo;well actually, it&amp;rsquo;s impossible.&amp;rdquo;  With man a rich man oras a literal camel going through the literal eye of a literal needle.&amp;rdquo;  Fortunately for us, there there&amp;rsquo;s good news.  Keep reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-then-can-be-saved&#34;&gt;Who then can be saved?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 19&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Luke 18&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;25  When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, “Who then can be saved?” 26  But Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;26  And they were exceedingly astonished, and said to him, “Then who can be saved?” 27  Jesus looked at them and said, “With man it is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;26  Those who heard it said, “Then who can be saved?” 27  But he said, “What is impossible with man is possible with God.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disciples were somewhat taken aback by this (if you notice, that has been happening a lot lately). In that culture, wealth indicated God&amp;rsquo;s apparent blessing.  Even more than that, the wealthy you gave to charity.  They provided for the synagogues.  They underwrote the temple and many of the sacrifices.  Today, our churches and synagogues couldn&amp;rsquo;t survive without donations from those with financial means.  It costs money to keep the lights on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the disciples had to be doubly surprised when Jesus repeated the statement.  I suspect because they were NOT originally asked to sell everything &amp;ndash; as we shall see, they left everything but did not necessarily SELL everything &amp;ndash; they might have felt they were now on shaky ground from a salvation perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love what they say here.  They don&amp;rsquo;t just ask how a rich person can be saved, they want to know how ANYONE CAN BE SAVED.  It&amp;rsquo;s like they knew Romans 3:23:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 3:23 For ALL have sinned and fallen short of the Glory of God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supernatural intervention is required for ANYONE to be saved.  With God, all things are possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men cannot achieve eternal life and entrance to the Kingdom without God&amp;rsquo;s divine intervention&amp;rdquo; interestingly, the Jewish midrash contains similar teachings, including a reference to the eye of a needle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holy one, blessed be He, said to Israel, &amp;ldquo;my sons, if you give me an opening of repentance no more significant than the size of the eye of a needle, I will widen it into a gap through which wagons and carriages can pass. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again this is not from the Bible, but I view it as a similar expression to having &amp;ldquo;faith the size of a mustard seed.&amp;rdquo;  God is the one who can move mountains.  God is the one who can save.   Our work, in a sense, is repentance and devotion to Yeshua, our Master, following him in the &amp;ldquo;Talmidim Way&amp;rdquo; - the way of discipleship. We give him that, and he takes us the rest of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, those with wealth have unique spiritual obstacles (and if you have a computer with internet access to read this, you&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;rich&amp;rdquo; compared to the rest of the world). Often, it is only with supernatural intervention that the affluent can control their wealth instead of the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saved by an M&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 1:26 For consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck Missler used to tell a story attributed to the Countess of Huntingdon (18th Century):  &amp;ldquo;Blessed by God, it does not say, &amp;lsquo;&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;ny mighty,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;ny noble.&amp;rsquo; It says &amp;lsquo;not &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;any mighty, not &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;any noble.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I owe my salvation to the letter &amp;lsquo;M.&amp;rsquo;  If it had  been &amp;lsquo;not &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;ny noble,&amp;rsquo; where would I have been?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to her, she was saved by that M.  If we have any amount wealth and material goods, we are saved by that &amp;ldquo;M&amp;rdquo; too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;27  Then Peter said in reply, “See, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?” 28  Jesus said to them, “Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;28  Peter began to say to him, “See, we have left everything and followed you.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;28  And Peter said, “See, we have left our homes and followed you.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;images/mat05686.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Fisherman letting down their nets&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostles left their livelihoods to follow Jesus. Many of them were fishermen by trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps feeling unsettled, they &amp;ldquo;remind&amp;rdquo; Jesus that they left their jobs, most possessions, and families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, they may have left everything, but they evidently didn’t actually SELL everything.  After the resurrection, during what was an apparent lull in the action between the resurrection and the ascension, several went back to their fishing gigs at the Sea of Galilee.  This is recorded in John 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While all three gospels go on to discuss Jesus&#39; response to Peter saying they left everything, Matthew adds that the disciples will sit over the 12 thrones, judging the 12 tribes.  To be placed over the 12 tribes was a tremendous honor and as mind-blowing as Jesus’ many other teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This promise has its fulfillment in Revelation 21:10-14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With verses like this, it is surprising to see that so-called “Replacement Theology” still has any proponents.  Replacement theology holds that God has cast out Israel because Israel rejected her Messiah and now deals exclusively with the church.  But not only does it have proponents, but it also remains the dominant belief throughout the Church, both protestant and Catholic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the very fact that God is not done with Israel is the entire reason there are 12 apostles in Matthew 10 and the reason that they were compelled to maintain that number in Acts 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;29  And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name&amp;rsquo;s sake, will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life. 30  But many who are first will be last, and the last first.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;29  Jesus said, “Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel, 30  who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life. 31  But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;29  And he said to them, “Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God, 30  who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the age to come eternal life.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that Mark says the scope is not just those who leave everything, but those who leave everything AND endure persecutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming Talmidim, disciples of Jesus is that good deed the rich ruler declined.  It reflects a changed heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus says his Talmidim have rewards both in this world And the age to come.  We don’t expect rewards in the age to come to be material, so we should not expect rewards in this age always to be material.  Of course, Judas reminds us that promised rewards can later be forfeited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No sacrifice for the Kingdom goes uncompensated. This promise is good to remember when we offer gifts or go through trials that few, if any, seem to notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the chapter breaks are man&amp;rsquo;s inventions.  The parable in Matthew 20 is directly related to Peter&amp;rsquo;s question and Jesus&#39; response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-parable-of-the-workers&#34;&gt;The parable of the workers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 20&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1  “For the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. 2  &lt;mark&gt;After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day&lt;/mark&gt;, he sent them into his vineyard. 3  And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the marketplace, 4  and to them he said, ‘You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you.’ 5  So they went. Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the same. 6  And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing. And he said to them, ‘Why do you stand here idle all day?’ 7  They said to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You go into the vineyard too.’&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favorite parables.  The Holy Spirit reminds me of it whenever I have any sense of envy or questioning of those in authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to having the familiar “the kingdom is like…” beginning, we would categorize this as one of the “last shall be first” parables dealing with a divine reversal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verse 2, we get the sense that there had been some negotiation on their wages.  This group wanted to make sure they got what was theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verse 4, the owner says “whatever is right, I will give you”.  These workers were, naturally, expecting something less than a full day’s wage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add to the drama, those still around the marketplace late in the day were often idlers not all that interested in work; and possibly they didn’t work that hard during the last hour of the day.  Even though this is just a parable and not an actual event, it’s reasonable to ask why these “workers” didn’t make their services available earlier in the day when the owner presumably would have hired them.  All of this makes the reversal at the end of the parable that much more “unfair” for those who started early in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the Hebrew idiom for selfishness.  It’s called “having a bad eye.”  Conversely, having a good eye means being generous, forgiving, and charitable.  You might recall we talked about this during the lessons on the Sermon on the Mount, when Jesus said, “the eye is the lamp of the body”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us all try to have good eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 20&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;8  And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, ‘Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first.’ 9  And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius. 10  Now when those hired first came, they thought they would receive more, but each of them also received a denarius. 11  And on receiving it they grumbled at the master of the house, 12  saying, ‘These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.’ 13  But he replied to one of them, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? 14  Take what belongs to you and go. I choose to give to this last worker as I give to you. 15  Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or do you begrudge my generosity?’ 16  So the last will be first, and the first last.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t this human nature?  Instead of minding their own business, some people like to sow irritation, division, and contempt.  If you don’t know what I’m talking about, hang out on Twitter for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must learn to be content with what we have and not worry about what someone else does with his money or possessions. Ultimately, it&amp;rsquo;s none of our business. The story is reminiscent of the Prodigal Son and the elder brother&amp;rsquo;s jealousy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Lancaster summarizes the parable as follows:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;King&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;God&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Laborers who worked all day&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The righteous&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;The laborer who worked only one hour&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A repentant sinner&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Wages&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;reward in the Messianic Age to come&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaning: In the Kingdom, the last shall be first, and the first shall be last.&lt;/strong&gt;  Or, as MacDonald in the Believer&amp;rsquo;s Bible Commentary, phrases it, &lt;strong&gt;it is better to leave our rewards up to the Master.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of salvation, entrance is at the owner&amp;rsquo;s sole discretion. The Thief on the Cross reminds us that some join late in the day while others join early in the morning
The Master has the prerogative to extend mercy and grace, even to those who don&amp;rsquo;t appear to us to deserve it. Those who came late in the day were just as repentant as those who came early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, salvation is unearned no matter who we are.  We are not in a position to judge whether anyone else merits it.  Like in the parable of the workers, it&amp;rsquo;s not our vineyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a saying that’s worth remembering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Heaven, there are people you&amp;rsquo;ll be surprised to see.&lt;br&gt;
In Heaven, there are also people who&amp;rsquo;ll be surprised to see you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poetically, this parable is another example of a Chiasm – a literary style where each verse or segment has a “twin” verse/segment that appears in inverted order. A Chiasm  begins with an “A” section, then a B section, then C, D, etc., followed by D’, C,’ B,’ finally ending with A.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;32  And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. And they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And taking the twelve again, he began to tell them what was to happen to him, 33  saying, “See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and deliver him over to the Gentiles. 34  And they will mock him and spit on him, and flog him and kill him.

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;31  And taking the twelve, he said to them, “See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished. 32  For he will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and shamefully treated and spit upon. 33  And after flogging him, they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise.” 34  But they understood none of these things.

&lt;p&gt;Jesus was at this time going through Jericho, passing first through the population center near the spring (near Tell Jericho) and then traveling on past Herod’s palaces (also known as the “administrative center”) before making His way up the Ascent of Adummim, which leads to Jerusalem.  The lowest point of Jericho is 900 feet below sea level, while Jerusalem is about 2500 above sea level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Jesus’ third prediction of his betrayal and demise.  The first time was the “get behind me Satan” exchange with Peter at Caesarea Philippi, and the second was right after that in Galilee.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Herod the Great: a symbol of authoritarian brutality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herod the great was notorious for decadence and brutality. Although there is no extra-biblical evidence for the &amp;ldquo;Slaughter of the Innocents&amp;rdquo; as recorded in Matthew, the incident is entirely consistent with what we do know about Herod&amp;rsquo;s character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herod once ordered the drownings of the High Priest and several family members in the pool at his palace here in Jericho. On another occasion, Herod wanted to make sure the people of Israel mourned when he died. He ordered the executions of several popular Jewish leaders, because the people would have mourned over their deaths. Fortunately, the surviving guards did not carry out Herod&amp;rsquo;s execution order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Herod died, his sons and later the Roman procurators continued this practice of brutally oppressing the Jewish people, culminating in the two great Jewish revolts, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Jewish%E2%80%93Roman_War&#34;&gt;first in 66 CE&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt&#34;&gt;second (the &amp;ldquo;Bar Kochba Revolt&amp;rdquo;) in 132 CE&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have to picture it.  Jesus is talking about suffering at the hands of those in charge as they were likely within sight of Herod’s palace where such suffering of innocent people often took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luke reminds us of the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. 31 . . . everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the evil Jesus is about to endure is part of a plan that was put in motion before time began and was documented in the prophets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;34  But they understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they did not grasp what was said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the disciples were not simply being “dense.”  They were supernaturally prevented from understanding these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sit-at-right-and-left&#34;&gt;Sit at right and left&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 20&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;20  Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came up to him with her sons, and kneeling before him she asked him for something. 21  And he said to her, “What do you want?” She said to him, “Say that these two sons of mine are to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;35  And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.” 36  And he said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?” 37  And they said to him, “Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This  request might not have been as outlandish as it first seemed.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James and John, along with Peter, were in Jesus&#39; inner circle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a sense, they were already getting preferential treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite Jesus&#39; ominous warnings, the prevailing attitude was that Jesus was about to usher in the Messianic Kingdom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salome may have been innocently requesting the seating arrangement at the messianic banquet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it was James and John directly, as Mark says, this is somewhat more puzzling
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus repeatedly told parables and gave instructions about how the first shall be last&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James and John, being part of Jesus inner circle should have known this better than anyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luke did mention that these things were &amp;ldquo;hidden&amp;rdquo; from the disciples, so perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s the excuse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;drink-my-cup&#34;&gt;Drink My Cup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 20&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;22  Jesus answered, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am to drink?” They said to him, “We are able.” 23  He said to them, “You will drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;38  Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?” 39  And they said to him, “We are able.” And Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink &lt;mark&gt;you will drink&lt;/mark&gt;, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized, 40  but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because no one anticipated Jesus&#39; suffering (remember the Spirit prevented their understanding), Jesus informs her that she has no idea what she is asking. The adage is true - we have two ears and one mouth.  Use them in proportion!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus issues a prophecy of sorts. James and John would indeed drink Jesus&#39; Cup of Suffering.
James was the first of the disciples to be martyred. John was the last of the disciples to die. Although he wasn&amp;rsquo;t literally martyred, according to tradition, Emperor Domitian sentenced him to death, first by poisoning, then by immersion into hot oil.  After he was miraculously spared, he was imprisoned and exiled on Patmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, we can envision Jesus passing the cup of martyrdom first to James sitting at Jesus&#39; left hand.  Then the cup goes all the way around the table, with the other disciples suffering martyrdom, ending with John, who is sitting at Jesus&#39; right side.  James died a martyr&amp;rsquo;s death while John lived a martyr&amp;rsquo;s life.  As the saying goes, &amp;ldquo;be careful what you wish for.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-ten-disciples-grumble&#34;&gt;The ten disciples grumble&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Matthew 20&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;24  And when the ten heard it, they were indignant at the two brothers. 25  But Jesus called them to him and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. 26  It shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, 27  and whoever would be first among you must be your slave, 28  even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;41  And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant at James and John. 42  And Jesus called them to him and said to them, “You know that those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. 43  But it shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, 44  and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all. 45  For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word of Salome&amp;rsquo;s request reached the other disciples, who were none too pleased with her request for preferential treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After just hearing a parable on how jealousy is inappropriate, this reaction is ironic.  As I like to say, we are no different.  Hearing Jesus’ words is a lot easier than living them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never underestimate Satan&amp;rsquo;s power, or just our pride, to sow division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes the catalyst will be the arrogant or misinformed statement of someone else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes, the catalyst will be misinterpreting something someone else said when no offense was intended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either Jesus redirects the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Son of Man came . . . to give His life as a ransom for many&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus challenged His disciples about the dangers of seeking earthly authority.  As our saying goes, &amp;ldquo;power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus would not have his disciples jockeying for power where they could abuse others; this is a warning the Church has not heeded for most of the past 2000 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talmidim of Jesus are to serve, not to be served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If necessary, we are to lay down our lives just as Jesus did.  If our master, who deserves to be a king was asked to lay down His life, how much more should we, who are not worthy of adoration be willing to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chuck Missler used to say, in Jesus’ organization chart, the CEO is at the bottom.  The last shall be first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we say “Talmidim Way,” that’s what we mean.  The way of being a disciple is to put ourselves last and others first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;study-questions&#34;&gt;Study Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your “take-away” from the story of the rich young ruler?  Meaning what would Jesus have you &amp;ldquo;take-away&amp;rdquo; from your life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you give your affluence over to God?  All of it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways do you thank God for making all things possible?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways do you need to have better “eyes”?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the parable, Jesus told the group hired at mid-day, “Whatever is right, I will give you.”  How can you apply this to your life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lesson is titled, &amp;ldquo;Zacchaeus and Bartimaeus&amp;rdquo; because of the healings, one physical and one spiritual of Blind Bartimaeus and Zacchaeus the wealthy tax collector.  In Luke, Jesus also gives the double-parable of the Minas (Pounds) and the King&amp;rsquo;s Return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson begins with Jesus passing through Jericho on His way up to Jerusalem for the Passover.  What Jesus knew, and what we, the readers, know, but what the disciples and others at the scene did not know is that this would be the final stop of His earthly ministry.  The most tumultuous and historically significant week in all of human history was about to begin, but first Jesus continues His mission to seek and save the lost sheep of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;46. And they came to Jericho. And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;35. As he drew near Jericho…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/32002488ace3431a2f55e4ddfae837fe.png&#34; alt=&#34;Jericho&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Notes:&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Matthew and Mark say they were leaving Jericho, while Luke says they were drawing near Jericho need not concern us. Dr. Bolen writes, “it is apparent that Jesus was leaving the population center of Jericho (as recorded in Matthew) and entering the area of the Herodian city (as recorded in Luke).”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lesson takes place in and around the city of Jericho. Jericho is only about 15 miles from Jerusalem, but they couldn’t be more opposite in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/64e48fd0624a152b3cd6f2097b3af360.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Jericho&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jericho lies deep in the Jordan Rift Valley, around 900 feet below sea level.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare this to Jerusalem, high in the Judean hills at about 2500 feet above sea level&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Jericho, freshwater is plentiful from the many springs. It is known as the “city of palms” because it is very much an oasis in the desert.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jerusalem’s only source of freshwater, the Gihon Spring, can only provide water for a few thousand people per year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jericho commands the central east-west approach to Jerusalem, making it strategically important.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Jordan was relatively easy to cross near Jericho.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This factor contributed to the wealth of Zacchaeus, the tax collector who was able to tax people coming and going.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite having tremendous religious importance, Jerusalem is neither strategic nor wealthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Jericho Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empires from the Persians to the Romans used Jericho as an administrative center. Alexander the Great had a private estate here. Mark Antony gave Jericho to Cleopatra as a gift. As we noted last time, Herod the Great had a palace here, which would still have been in use as Jesus made His way through the city. Much like he did with Jerusalem, Herod expanded his “footprint” in the city with several public works, military buildings, a hippodrome/theatre complex to entertain the masses, and of course, his lavish private palace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Israel’s history, we know that Jericho is significant for being the first town Joshua and the Israelites could capture using a unique battle plan. Of significance for us is the town of Gilgal. This is where God made the Israelites stop, get circumcised (a very odd thing to do before a battle!), sanctify themselves, and celebrate Passover (Joshua 5:1-12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back even further, archeologists have unearthed artifacts that date to ~8000 BCE in the new stone age period – that’s 6000 years before Abraham. Historians believe Jericho is the oldest, continuously inhabited city in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The setting here is a little over a week before Passover. Crowds are beginning to swell. The beginning of the narrow Ascent of Adummim would have represented a bottleneck, with people backing into Jericho.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, primarily, but perhaps not exclusively due to Jesus, the expectation grew for a Messianic deliverer. Such hope is always higher around Passover, as the feast recalls Israel’s miraculous deliverance from oppressive Egypt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those who realized God sent Jesus had every reason to think a similar redemption was at hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Mar 10:46-52&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luk 18:35-43&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Matthew 20&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Mark 10&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Luke 18&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;29. As they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him. 30. And behold, two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!” 31. The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be silent, but they cried out all the more, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;46. And they came to Jericho. And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the roadside. 47. And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” 48. And many rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;35. As he drew near Jericho, a blind man sat begging by the roadside. 36. Hearing a crowd going by, he inquired what this meant. 37. They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.” 38. And he cried out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” 39. And those in front rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again, we note Mark’s attention to detail. He gives us the beggar’s name, Bartimaeus.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since others whom Jesus healed are usually unnamed, this might seem to suggest that Bartimaeus might have achieved some notoriety in the early apostolic community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark also translates the man’s name for his Roman readership who didn’t speak Hebrew or Aramaic. Bar in Aramaic means “son,” so the man’s name means the son of Timaeus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The healing is relatively straightforward, so it could be easy to miss some nuances.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark and Luke record that he is told “Jesus of Nazareth” passes by. ישׁוע (Yeshua) was a widespread name, but there is only one Yeshua of Nazareth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bartimaeus makes a messianic declaration when he exclaims, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” – in other words, this blind man could “see” better than most people of his day. Although he was blind, he saw Jesus clearly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their persistence is admirable. Do we shout louder for Jesus to help us, or do we give up at the first sign of the crowd telling us to be quiet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;

    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;One or two? Coming or going?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew and Mark say they were leaving Jericho, but Luke says they drew near Jericho. Matthew says there were two beggars, but Mark and Luke say there was only one. Which is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discussed the first question in the introduction. Jericho’s had two distinct sections: a population and a government center. They were about a mile apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, of the three authors, Luke would have been the least familiar with the geography of Jericho, and he was writing to an audience that would not have necessarily had any familiarity with the region. Perhaps he got this minor detail wrong. If so, insignificant discrepancies such as these need not concern us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to whether one versus two blind people were healed, this is similarly a non-issue, in my opinion. Matthew occasionally says multiple people were involved in an incident when Mark and Luke discuss only one person. Matthew was an eyewitness to these events, whereas the other writers may have edited their stories to focus on the most significant individual. Further, Mark does not say there was “only Bartimaeus.” We can easily reconcile this. They came upon two blind men, one of whom was named Bartimaeus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember that the Books of the Bible are not transcripts of every event that happened. They are carefully edited and revised narratives. They are stories designed to get at the essence of a particular event. Then perhaps they were changed and edited some more as the years passed, leading up to the point at which they were canonized (finalized).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These minor discrepancies are significant for one huge reason: they demonstrate a lack of coordination and collaboration among the gospel writers. If multiple witnesses’ testimonies match too closely, people become suspicious that they might have gotten together beforehand to concoct a cover story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of chronology, Lancaster sees this event as happening after the episodes with Zacchaeus as they were leaving Jerusalem and starting the Ascent of Adummim leading up to Jerusalem. Beggars would have been more “successful” here, where a crowd of people would be converging for the pilgrimage, then elsewhere in the middle of Jericho. Specifically, Lancaster places the event &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; “they came to Jericho” in Mark 10:46, but &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; “And as he was leaving Jericho.” in the same verse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;td&gt;32. And stopping, Jesus called them and said, “What do you want me to do for you?” 33. They said to him, “Lord, let our eyes be opened.” 34. And Jesus in pity touched their eyes, immediately recovered their sight, and followed him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;49. And Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” And they called the blind man, saying to him, “Take heart. Get up; he is calling you.” 50. And throwing off his cloak, he sprang up and came to Jesus. 51. And Jesus said to him, “What do you want me to do for you?” And the blind man said to him, “Rabbi, let me recover my sight.” 52. And Jesus said to him, “Go your way; your faith has made you well.” And immediately, he recovered his sight and followed him on the way.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;40. And Jesus stopped and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him, 41. “What do you want me to do for you?” He said, “Lord, let me recover my sight.” 42. And Jesus said to him, “Recover your sight; your faith has made you well.” 43. He immediately recovered his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They knew what they needed.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He doesn’t ask Jesus for a few coins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He asks to be healed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How often do we ask for the &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; thing we need?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This time, there is no elaborate mud ritual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus’ touch is all the men need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus commends them for their faith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They immediately follow Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of healings have become commonplace in Mark. They have a double purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, Mark records selected events in Jesus’ ministry that demonstrated Jesus’ authority over the physical world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, as Lancaster says, these infirmities “symbolize the Master’s struggle with the spiritual impediments besetting His generation. These impediments prevented the people from repenting, recognizing the Messiah, and obtaining the kingdom.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparison-with-the-rich-young-ruler&#34;&gt;Comparison with the Rich Young Ruler&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster concludes the section with a table comparing the Rich Young Ruler to Blind Bartimaeus, which I have modified slightly&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Jesus’ reply&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“Keep the commandments; sell everything.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“What do you want me to do for you?”&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Sad, causing others to wonder, “who then can be saved?”&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lesson&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;When we depend on our adequacy and our righteousness, we go away sad&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;When we humble ourselves enough to ask for mercy, we are rewarded for our faith in the Son of David. Our faith is about the best we can offer to Him. He has EVERYTHING to offer us.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;zacchaeus-the-tax-collector&#34;&gt;Zacchaeus, the tax collector&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 19:1-4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
1. He entered Jericho and was passing through.
2. And behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector and was wealthy.
3. He was seeking to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd, he could not because he was small in stature.
4. So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for Jesus was about to pass that way.
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/ad09ca3fccdb82076f4cf3d075fcbe64.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are told Zacchaeus was the &lt;em&gt;chief&lt;/em&gt; tax collector, yet he wanted to see Jesus badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This sets the stage for another “last shall be first” reversal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tax collectors were near the bottom of civilized Jewish society (See the call-out box below for further background).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most &amp;ldquo;sinners&amp;rdquo; would avoid someone who is seen as morally superior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zacchaeus was probably less than five feet tall, so he climbed something more like a middle eastern fig tree versus a North American sycamore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These trees have short trunks and branches relatively close to the ground, making them easy to climb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like it is today, climbing trees is seen as a child’s activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could say that by elevating himself, Zacchaeus was lowering himself in the eyes of others.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can draw a parallel to the prodigal son&amp;rsquo;s father.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was considered degrading for the patriarch of the family to run after anything, yet this is exactly what the father did in the story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wonder if both men, the father and Zacchaeus, aren&amp;rsquo;t a picture of our Heavenly Father who will overcome any obstacle to be with us.  Conversely, we should be more like the two men, removing any obstacles that get in our way between us and communion with God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;The taxman cometh&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zacchaeus was hated because he worked for the man…the Ro-man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jericho was a major administrative and tax center, as mentioned in the introduction. It was also a border town between Judea and Perea across the river. Unlike Joshua’s day, the Jordan was easily crossed in Jesus’ time. All of this made Jericho “one of the wealthiest cities of Palestine in the most fertile part of Judea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we introduced Matthew, we talked a bit about the system. They didn’t have actual, fixed tax rates. Whatever the tax collector could muscle out of the victim was fair game. It was a dirty business. If the collector thought someone underpaid his taxes, he had the authority to jail the citizen until he paid up. Further, they had something like a multi-level marketing scheme in which lower tax collectors had to give their bosses a cut. Zacchaeus was at the top of the pyramid, and he was loaded. It’s easy to see how the citizens considered Jews like Matthew and Zacchaeus traitors and thieves. Avoiding the taxman was seen as a duty among the faithful. As a result, tax collectors were ostracized from the rest of Jewish society. They were disqualified from serving as a witness in a trial. Because their occupation required them to be dishonest, they could never be trusted to tell the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, Himself, said His disciples should treat the unrepentant as if he was a tax collector. That is to shun him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Note: &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;friend-of-sinners&#34;&gt;Friend of Sinners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 19:5-7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
5. And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I must stay at your house today.”
6. So he hurried and came down and received him joyfully.
7. And when they saw it, they all grumbled, “He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.”  
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine all the people who wanted to see Jesus, like how our folks line the street of a motorcade today.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not only does he stop and call someone out for special attention, but that person also happens to be a hated tax collector!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luke has a number of these stories that juxtapose a repentant sinner with the murmuring of the self-righteous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zacchaeus would have been well known to the city’s people and not well known in a good way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why would Jesus choose to honor this lowlife?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any food he might serve Jesus would have been purchased with stolen money, making Jesus in some way complicit in the crime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zacchaeus was a symbol of all that was wrong with Roman oppression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zacchaeus was supposed to be ostracized, but Jesus isn’t playing by the rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversely, we can imagine the town’s religious leaders expected Jesus to dine with them.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe they had already started preparing their houses in the hopes that they would get to entertain this critical guest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, this event happened right around the time Jesus told the parable of the workers. Here, we see something very similar.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The “owner” of it all can choose to bestow favor on whomever he pleases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They didn’t like who Jesus chose, so they grumbled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep in mind that these people weren’t simply petty in their dislike for Zacchaeus. He was a thief.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They had probably all been victimized by him, and he made their lives harder than they needed to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus, of course, knows the end from the beginning, and he knows what is going to happen next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;teshuvah&#34;&gt;Teshuvah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 19:8-10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
8. And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold.”
9. And Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house since he also is a son of Abraham.
10. For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I imagine the grumbling people were quite surprised the next day when they got a knock on the door and handed a bag of cash, four times the amount that they had initially been paid!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They were ultimately quite glad Jesus spent some time with Zacchaeus!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Jesus gave him an ultimatum as He did for the Rich Young Ruler, it is not recorded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can take away from the text is that Jesus chose to honor an outcast, and he repented.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that he repented from &lt;em&gt;exploiting others&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on John the Baptist&amp;rsquo;s warning to a previous group of tax collectors, we should not necessarily assume that the man gave up being a tax collector (Luke 3:12-13).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hebrew word for repentance is &lt;em&gt;teshuvah&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As with many Hebrew words, action is implied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we with our &amp;ldquo;western&amp;rdquo; minds think of repentance, we might think of a chance of heart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a Hebraic mindset, that change of heart is always accompanied by action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this case, a good deed reflects repentance that started in the heaert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We touched on this last time with the Rich Young Ruler.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Zacchaeus’ case, his heart was right, so good deeds followed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the young man’s case, his heart wasn’t right despite his claim to have kept all the commandments Jesus listed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a potential that both exchanges happened on the same day, which would have highlighted the contrast in the disciples’ eyes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remuneration
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Torah assigns various levels of remuneration for theft depending on the circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zacchaeus gave himself the highest level: quadruple damages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;yeshua-has-come&#34;&gt;Yeshua has come&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Jesus says, “Today, salvation has come,” this is not because of the good deed of giving half to the poor and remediating with quadruple damages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salvation came because of his repentance, which was subsequently evidenced by the act.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zacchaeus would undoubtedly have been familiar with John the Baptist in this geographic region.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps it was one of Zacchaeus&#39; direct-reports who met John the Baptist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While it appears Zacchaeus did not immediately repent at John’s words, perhaps a seed was planted that took some time to grow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to remember this when we don’t see immediate fruit from our ministry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There could be growth going on that we can’t see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is also a deliberate pun. Yeshua means salvation.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not only was Zacchaeus saved in the spiritual sense, Jesus, but the embodiment of salvation had also come to his house and was sitting across from him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Son of Abraham
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is also significant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He was one of the lost sheep of Israel, once thought to be beyond reach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet Jesus restores him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewish people of that day (like many nominal Christians today) believed they had salvation just by being Jewish.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, this could be forfeited by self-exclusion, such as becoming a tax collector or some other type of sinner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we entertain the fact that he remained a tax collector, this inclusion and restoration would have been even more offensive to those in attendance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recall previous lessons where we discussed the divine reversal, including the last lesson where those who showed up for work at the 11th hour (the repentant sinner) got the same wage as those who had been working all day (the lifelong believer).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-man-goes-on-a-journey&#34;&gt;A man goes on a journey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 19:11-12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
11. As they heard these things, he proceeded to tell a parable because he was near to Jerusalem and because they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.
12. He said, therefore, “A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note the last part of verse 11. They expected the political kingdom immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Journey parables have a common theme.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Man goes on a journey, yet before he leaves, he entrusts his operation to a group of servants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When he returns, typically unexpectedly, the owner demands an accounting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The righteous are rewarded while the wicked are punished&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the original audience, there may have been (at least) three layers of intended meaning:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, we are individually accountable in the absence of direct supervision
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul elaborates on this in Ephesians 6
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the Bible talks about &amp;ldquo;masters&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;slaves&amp;rdquo;, we need to substitute &amp;ldquo;employers&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;employees&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;clients&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;contractors&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, After His Resurrection, Jesus will be “away” for a while
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The disciples (i.e., you and me) are entrusted not only with keeping the operation moving but also delivering a return on investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When He comes again, not only will the wicked be judged at the Great White Throne Judgment, but those deemed righteous will have their works evaluated at the Bema Seat Judgment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third, Israel has not had direct supervison but now the King is returning and will audit the books
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, the parables possibly explain the coming judgment about to fall on Jerusalem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Through Moses, God had delivered to the people a perfect system for keeping in communion with Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In many ways, the Torah is written like a contract; it promises life to those who fulfill the terms and death to those who do not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now Jesus, in a sense, the “second Moses,” is returning to audit the books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If He found that generation had produced fruit in keeping with repentance, His arrival would have brought reward – the Messianic Kingdom would have begun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since He found that generation had failed to fulfill the terms, His appearance brings judgment – destruction, exile, and a delay of the Kingdom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These three would serve to communicate, albeit indirectly, that He is not the messiah, they’re looking for. There will be no immediate Messianic Kingdom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears Luke may have combined two parables into one. Both begin with “a nobleman went into a far country to claim his Kingdom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The “Parable of the Minas” is Luke 12-13, 15b-26.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The “Parable of the King’s Return” is Luke 12, 14-15a, 27.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both parables begins with a nobleman going into a far country to receive his kingdom. Keener points out, “Herod the Great (in 40 BCE) and Archelaus (in 4 BCE) each had to go to Rome to receive their right to rule Judea&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus’ audience would have immediately recalled this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When they heard the opening words of the parable, they would have thought, “oh, you mean just like Herod and Archelaus.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means, to the original audience hearing the parable, the protagonist in the parable was hated, wicked, and dishonest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we evaluate the parables, we need to keep in mind Jesus’ stated reason for telling them: BECAUSE THEY SUPPOSED THE KINGDOM OF GOD WAS TO APPEAR IMMEDIATELY.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;parable-of-the-minas&#34;&gt;Parable of the Minas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 19:12-15&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
12. He said, therefore, “A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.
13. Calling ten of his servants, he gave them ten minas and said to them, ‘Engage in business until I come.’
15. When he returned, having received the kingdom, …
15. … he ordered these servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by doing business.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A mina was roughly three months’ wages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As is the theme with “man goes on a journey” parables, the workers are given an unannounced amount of time to grow their investments.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although it is not stressed in this parable, in “Journey Parables,” the master returns unannounced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means the workers (or bridesmaids) should constantly be in a heightened state of preparedness and expectation regardless of the length of the absence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-audit&#34;&gt;The audit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 19:16-26&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
16. The first came before him, saying, ‘Lord, your mina has made ten minas more.’
17. And he said to him, ‘Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.’
18. And the second came, saying, ‘Lord, your mina has made five minas.’
19. And he said to him, ‘And you are to be over five cities.’
20. Then another came, saying, ‘Lord, here is your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief;
21. I was afraid of you because you are a severe man. You take what you did not deposit and reap what you did not sow.’
22. He said to him, ‘I will condemn you with your own words, you wicked servant! You knew that I was a severe man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow?
23. Why then did you not put my money in the bank, and at my coming, I might have collected it with interest?’
24. And he said to those who stood by, ‘Take the mina from him, and give it to the one who has the ten minas.’
25. And they said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten minas!’
26. ‘I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although ten servants were given a mina each, we are only told the audit results of three.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first two must have had good asset managers as the ROI (return on investment) was 1000% and 500%, respectively.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to one commentator, this return is too good to be true; therefore, we should understand and apply the meaning of the parable accordingly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They were then put in charge over much more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third wrapped up his mina in a scarf.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In that culture, wrapping up a sum of money and laying it away meant it couldn’t be touched.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;matthews-parable-of-the-talents-matthew-25&#34;&gt;Matthew&amp;rsquo;s Parable of the Talents (Matthew 25)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although the parables are quite similar, there are some key differences
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Matthew’s version, there are three servants, not ten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The currency is a “talent” (a talent is 6000 denarii – so 23-25 years’ wages – a significant sum!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of each servant getting equal, the three servants get 5, 2, and 1 respectively.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first two deliver 100% ROI (somewhat more reasonable than the return on the Minas)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These servants are told, “well done, good and faithful servant. You were faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Luke&amp;rsquo;s version, there is no &amp;ldquo;good servant&amp;rdquo; (although there is &amp;ldquo;failthful&amp;rdquo;), neither is there &amp;ldquo;joy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third servant responds much like the third servant in the Mina parable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of application, Lancaster concludes, “If the parable of the ten minas describes how equal opportunities can be used differently to achieve different results, the parable of the talents describes how different opportunities and resources can be used equally to achieve the same results.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;” Strikingly, the third servant is not merely reprimanded. Still, he is cast into Gehenna, where “there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” (Matthew 25:30)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prevailing view assumes the parable is roughly equivalent to the Matthew 25 version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The two were rewarded, and the one was punished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we are faithful in the small things, Jesus will reward us with more important things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As for the seemingly impossible rate of return, with man, this is impossible (at least without fraud or insider trading), but all things are possible with God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparation for this lesson, I came across two different views of the meaning of this parable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since both conclusions can benefit us as disciples, I will present them both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The alternative view is discussed at the end of the lesson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming the prevailing view, a takeaway of the parable would be that Jesus doesn’t want us coasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He expects us to produce good works if we are his disciples and servants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again, we do this not to get saved but because we are saved.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish scribes recount similar “faithful with small things” lessons with Moses and David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both started as shepherds leading literal, four-legged sheep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because they proved themselves faithful, God put them each over His people Israel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God tests us in small matters each day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some modifications, Lancaster’s conclusion of the Ten Minas is below&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;King = Messiah&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Journey = Messiah’s absence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Servants = disciples/Israel/you and me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minas = the work of the kingdom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faithful Servants = disciples focused on the kingdom work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfaithful servant = those who have neglected the work of the kingdom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reward = advancement in the kingdom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Punishment = loss of the kingdom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaning = Those faithful with the responsibilities entrusted to them will be rewarded at the coming of the Messiah. Those who are negligent will be punished.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;parable-of-the-kings-return&#34;&gt;Parable of the King’s Return&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
12. He said, therefore, “A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.
14. His citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We do not want this man to reign over us.’
15. … he returned, having received the kingdom, …
27. (and said) these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slaughter them before me.’”
28. When he had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/ae852c903db4cdf4484fba55dd9b9de6.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, hearers of this parable would have immediately recalled the Herodian ruler Archelaus. After Herod the Great died around 4 BCE, his kingdom was split among his sons. Like other famous, wealthy neurotics, Herod had multiple wills that needed to be sorted out. Antipas believed he should have inherited the title “King of the Jews” from his father. The Romans disagreed. Archelaus got Judea and Samaria, Antipas got Galilee and Perea, and Philip got the territory to the northeast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Passover, Archelaus slaughtered approximately 3000 Jews in the temple in Jerusalem&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Following this, a delegation of Judeans went to Rome to petition for relief. Ultimately, he was banished to Vienna, and the Roman Procurators’ age began. See map for these boundaries&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we assume the ruler in the parable(s) is supposed to represent Jesus, why would Jesus compare Himself to the wicked Archelaus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One explanation: as we have mentioned, Jesus’ parables often have flawed protagonists.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the lessons is “if a flawed human can do good things (like reward high-producing servants), how much more will perfect God do those things.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another possible explanation: for context, note He said these things as he was going up to Jerusalem.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He knew, but the disciples did not, that He will be rejected and hated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While we believers, do not view Jesus as an evil ruler, non-believers do not share our opinions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For our purposes, we can include the Jerusalem religious establishment in the category of non-believers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this respect, Jesus was hated just like this ruler was.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, in this second interpretation, the parable’s meaning is that judgment awaits those who oppose the kingdom.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If our image of Jesus is as a blonde-haired Scandinavian who goes around the shores of the Sea of Galilee patting children on the head, we may find these words startling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those people have never read the last few chapters of Revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Jesus comes again, His enemies will be put down, and God wins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we said above about the “Journey” parables, Jesus’ first-coming, as well as His second-coming, are in view. Although they are “successful” at having Jesus cast aside, in about 40 years, the Romans will invade and slaughter the residents of Jerusalem. Those who survive are sent into exile. Either way, judgment awaits those who reject the rightful ruler. Jesus is also possibly dropping another hint that the Messianic political Kingdom will wait.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
As mentioned, Aubrey Taylor, writing in the “Lexham Geographic Commentary,” believes Luke’s version is not merely a retelling of Matthew’s Parable of the Talents. “When the setting of the parable is accounted for, it becomes clear Jesus is delivering a critique of exploitative power structures—not celebrating them as a model of discipleship.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument is compelling, so I submit it here for Acts 17:11 analysis. Also, perhaps both interpretations are valid. Parables usually only have one meaning, but they don’t always have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view hinges on the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;comparing the ruler in the parable(s) to Herod Archelaus, not Jesus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the too good to be true returns on investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the geographic setting: Jericho, in view of Herod’s palaces, on the way up to Jerusalem, where the Messianic Kingdom will NOT be initiated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the context of Zacchaeus repenting and refunding (with damages) his ill-gotten wealth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parable begins with a nobleman going into a far country to receive his kingdom, which Archelaus did a few years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above, we asked, “Why would Jesus compare Himself to the wicked Archelaus?” Taylor argues that He would not and did not intend to make that comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the economy of that day, “the very act of doing business for profit was considered immoral, the profit margins presented by the first to servants were downright evil.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike today’s economy, where a rising tide lifts all boats, it was seen as zero-sum in that day. If one person gained, that means another person lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In that culture, the nobleman would have been the villain, and the third slave would have been the hero!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The speculation is that the first two slaves would have had to resort to harassment and thievery to generate those massive returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m sympathetic to this view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even today, if someone showed those percentages of returns, we likely would assume that there were some shenanigans; perhaps the asset manager received an insider-trading tip or something like that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Taylor’s view, it was the third slave who acted honorably.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He did not lose any part of the initial investment. He wrapped it in a cloth for safekeeping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He did not directly disobey the wicked ruler, but he didn’t do anything to help him either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, in the fourth century, Eusebius referenced yet another version of the parable (in the now lost Gospel of the Nazarenes) where the third servant was &lt;strong&gt;rewarded&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taylor sees this interpretation as more fitting in the context of following the story of Zacchaeus, who gave away his ill-gotten earnings with Luke 19:11.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As they heard these things, he proceeded to tell a parable because he was near to Jerusalem and &lt;strong&gt;because they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, they wanted a national kingdom to replace Rome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to this view, &lt;strong&gt;Jesus responds that it would be absurd to establish the kingdom of God based on the model of Rome&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the first century, Israel’s recent history bore this out.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewish people rightly celebrate Hanukkah (as did Jesus Himself in John 10:22), where a group of rebels defeated the tyrannical Greek Seleucid empire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet only a few decades later, Israel’s own rulers, the Hasmoneans, showed themselves to be just as ruthless, inept, and just as corrupt as their Greek counterparts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In later centuries, Church history proved this as well.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taylor’s argument appeals to me because I give the most weight to what the original audience would have understood.   * What they would have understood is likely what Jesus meant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus would show us there&amp;rsquo;s going to be a different way.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He will enter Jerusalem not on a conquering horse but a humble donkey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“But, amid the crowds calling out for a king and a rescuer, He must have realized his message was falling on deaf ears.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll look at that entry in Lesson 39.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this said, the similarities of this parable to Matthew 25 can’t be ignored. The context of Matthew’s parable is a “good and faithful servant who enters into his master’s rest.” Luke’s parable is almost identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, while they appear conflicting, the two interpretations are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  In any case, we need to stay focus on kingdom work and not become complacent while Jesus is &amp;ldquo;away&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More applicable than the parable is we need to have the heart of Zacchaeus. We need to joyfully make it right when we are wrong because salvation has come to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lesson is titled “The Triumphal Entry” because we have finally arrived at the most significant week in all human history. The next seven days are a roller coaster of emotions, ending on the highest peak of all, the Resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 39 will be in two parts. Part I will review the Ascent of Adummim, which connects Jericho to Jerusalem. We’ll meet up with Jesus and the recently resurrected Lazarus in Bethany, look at how Jesus procures a donkey for his entry into Jerusalem, and examine the crowd’s reaction as they welcomed Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction-the-final-week-begins&#34;&gt;Introduction: The Final Week Begins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note about the “Final Week” – We are “only” in John chapters 11 and 12, so the last ten chapters of John deal with this week and post-resurrection. Lancaster&amp;rsquo;s commentary is a five-volume set. Each volume has around 400 pages. The Triumphal entry occurs about ½ way into volume 4. In other words, even though it looks like we’re nearing the end from a timeline perspective, we have a LOT of Gospel still ahead of us. Our format will take another 14 lessons to cover the events in the eight calendar days between Palm Sunday and Resurrection Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is undoubtedly the most influential and most personally significant week in all of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;these things&amp;rdquo; are the Minas and the King&amp;rsquo;s Returning parables we studied in Lesson 38.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chart comes from AD Riddle&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and shows Herod’s palace, Jericho, to Jerusalem. Presumably, the -720 is from the Herodian Palaces, west of the modern city and slightly higher. Modern Jericho’s height is listed at -864 feet, making it the lowest and the oldest continuously inhabited city on Earth. Today much of the Kidron valley has been filled in, so the elevation difference between that and Jerusalem is not as significant. Still, one had to be in excellent physical shape to make this trek. Today we do it in an air-conditioned bus with Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginning of the Following the Messiah episode 8 has an excellent segment about this ascent. Watch through 8:55.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 11:55-57&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;55 Now, the Passover of the Ioudaioi was at hand, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves.   56 They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, “What do you think? That he will not come to the feast at all?”   57 Now, the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, he should let them know so that they might arrest him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the week leading up to Passover, Jerusalem would swell with Pilgrims. By some estimates, a population of perhaps a few hundred thousand could swell to 2-3 million. This helps explain several dynamics, most notably why the city&amp;rsquo;s leadership (both the Romans and the temple establishment) might be more on edge. It also makes locating one person in that crowd a non-trivial task.Ceremonial purification could take up to a week, especially if that person had come into contact with a corpse (Numbers 19). The Jewish Sages applied those same standards to any Jew living in a foreign country – gentile nations are inherently unclean. Remember this point when we get to Acts. This notion of ceremonial uncleanliness has a lot to do with the disciples&#39; attitudes and reticence concerning dining with non-Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were looking for Jesus, meaning the people were wondering whether He would claim his Messianic title. The Passover/Feast of Unleavened bread was compulsory, so it would be very unusual for Him not to show up, especially since He only had to travel a relatively short distance from Galilee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public didn’t realize that “the game’s afoot,” as Sherlock Holmes might say. The Jerusalem &amp;ldquo;deep state&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot; had already decreed that Jesus needed to be taken out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;A Passover Seder&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/7f5926edfba1e6038c96b7bb867e4ffd.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get a chance to participate in a Passover Seder, you should take advantage of it. It is rich with Symbolism and Biblical history. Christians/Messianic Jews see additional symbolism that represents Jesus. For example, there are traditionally three pieces of Matzah wafers. The way it is baked, it has holes (like saltine crackers) and stripes. He was pierced for our iniquities, and his stripes heal us. Additionally, the 2nd of the three pieces is literally broken and “hidden” away until after the meal. Most Jews will tell you they don’t know why this is. Christians may have a better idea as this speaks of Jesus&#39; Resurrection, where He is absent for a time, and we await rejoining Him at the Marriage Supper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note Jesus and other 1st Century Jews did not celebrate the Passover the way Jewish people observe the festival today. However, the Last Supper accounts in the Gospels record several themes and practices with today’s Passover Seder. The use of the Seder plate is a post-biblical tradition, but it serves as a helpful illustration of the traditional observance of the festival. Today’s traditional Seder plate includes a shank bone (replaced above with a piece of chicken), charoset (brown mixture), bitter herbs (lettuce), bitter herbs (parsley), egg, and a vegetable. The letters in the center of the plate are Pei Samech Chet (Hebrew is read from right to left). This spells Pesach. In many non-English countries, Easter goes by the name of Pesach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Precise dating of this week is difficult&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 12:1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;1** Six days before the Passover, Jesus, therefore, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.**&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John 12:1, dating these events in the final week is a problem. We are not told precisely what year all this went down, so we must do our best with what we know. Some scholars believe this is 32 CE/AD because of a prophecy in Daniel 9, which we will discuss in Part II. Other scholars land on 33 or 30 CE/AD because, in these years, the date of the Passover meal would have been on a Thursday with his crucifixion on a Friday. There is strong traditional evidence that the crucifixion was on a Friday, but some scholars are not convinced. We will have to save this discussion for a later lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even here in John 12:1, while most scholars believe John meant six days before Nissan 14, the Passover sacrifice, some believe he told six days before Nissan 15, the Passover meal ushering in the seven-day feast of unleavened bread.  This is further complicated by John&amp;rsquo;s placing the perfume anointing story six days before the Passover, while Mark says it was two-days before.  There is some suggestion John may have been using a different calendar than the Synoptic Gospel writers, but that may not fully explain the perfume discrepancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If none of these dating discrepancies bothers you and you don’t care because you’re just glad Jesus died for your sins and rose again, you’re probably much better off than the rest of us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lazarus-causes-ioudaioi-to-believe-in-jesus&#34;&gt;Lazarus causes &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; to believe in Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;John 12:9-11&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9 When the large crowd of the &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; learned that Jesus was there, they came, not only on account of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. 10 So the chief priests made plans to put Lazarus to death as well, 11 because on account of him, many of the &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; were going away and believing in Jesus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been said that Lazarus was first DEAD before Jesus. He was in a state where he could do nothing to help himself. He needed Jesus. Then there was a period where he was symbolically DEFEATED. Although he had been raised, he was still in his grave clothes. This is symbolic of the Christian who has been saved but can’t or won’t let go of past “stuff” holding them back. Then once he got rid of his grave clothes, he was DANGEROUS, so much so that the deep state wanted him taken out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are getting specific, note that John says it wasn’t even the entire temple establishment that wanted Lazarus gone; it was a much smaller subgroup of the chief priests. The number of conspirators against Jesus might have been MUCH more minor than we might otherwise imagine. I’m sure Lazarus had quite a story to tell, but we remember that in Luke 16:31, Jesus said that even if one comes back from the dead, many would still not be persuaded.Just a reminder, when reading the Gospel of John, when we read “the Jews,” we need to avoid automatically inferring “the bad guys.” John is very imprecise with some of his terms. The Ioudaioi in verses 9 and 11 are clearly on the side of Jesus. Here we have a POTENTIAL ambiguity. Are these Ioudaioi the everyday commonfolk Jews, or could John also say that many of the TEMPLE ESTABLISHMENT Ioudaioi came to believe in Jesus? THAT second possibility would rattle the chief priests. We don’t know, but it’s fun speculation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Now when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;2 saying to them, “Go into the village in front of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;3 If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and he will send them at once.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Now when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;2 and said to them, “Go into the village in front of you, and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;3 If anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.’”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;29 When he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;30 saying, “Go into the village in front of you, where on entering you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever yet sat. Untie it and bring it here.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;31 If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you shall say this: ‘The Lord has need of it.’”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark and Luke note “a donkey on which no one has ever sat – according to Lancaster, Animals used for many Jewish rituals had to be pure. This includes being without blemish and never being ridden or yoked. Lancaster also draws a parallel with Jesus’ tomb in which no one had previously lain.As donkeys are notorious for being wild and difficult to break, the fact that Jesus walked up, mounted, and rode without being bucked could potentially be another miracle. It might also explain why it took two disciples to fetch the animal. Unbroken donkeys are also supposedly attached to their mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photo by Dr. Bolen&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; shows the journey from Bethany, through Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives. Jesus didn’t only make this journey on Palm Sunday. He spent a lot of time with Lazarus, Mary, and Martha. This aerial perspective shows the route that Jesus probably took MANY mornings as He walked from Bethany to Jerusalem. In addition to beginning the Palm Sunday walk, one of the things we do when we go there is remember that Jesus also ascended from the Mount of Olives (Acts 1:9-12). We also tend to want to look up to the sky. Zechariah 14:4 says, “His feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east”…The somewhat adjacent Bethphage churches mark the typical starting point for a Palm Sunday procession. Since it’s about a 15-minute walk from Bethphage to the summit of the Mount of Olives, tours like the one I did begin at an overlook on the Mount of Olives near the Ascension church.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Did Jesus prophesy regarding the donkey?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/9aed9aa5c1d2045b2e8c5dbbf23fc17c.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This donkey was photographed while running loose on the Greek Orthodox compound at Bethphage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars are conflicted about whether Jesus’ instructions represent a prophecy with a relatively quick miraculous fulfillment, a logical forecast given the attitudes towards hospitality in that day, or whether this was some pre-arranged code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster argues for a miracle by noting the amount of space the gospel writers spend on it. If it was prearranged or expected, he theorizes the evangelists probably would have merely written, “they brought Jesus a donkey.” None of the gospels mention a pre-arranged signal, yet that didn’t stop people from bringing forth that theory. It’s intriguing, but there is little evidence for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keener makes an argument for the hospitality theory “the donkey’s owner probably saw it as helpful hospitality to a famous rabbi.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, as we mentioned on the previous slide, Jesus spent a lot of time in this area. It makes sense that He would know where to find a donkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, saying,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;5 “Say to the daughter of Zion, ‘Behold, your king is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.’”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;6 The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;7 They brought the donkey and the colt and put on them their cloaks, and he sat on them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street, and they untied it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;5 And some of those standing there said to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;6 And they told them what Jesus had said, and they let them go.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;7 And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it, and he sat on it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32 So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;33 And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;34 And they said, “The Lord has need of it.”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;35 And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their cloaks on the colt, they set Jesus on it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14 And Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;15 “Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your king is coming, sitting on a donkey&amp;rsquo;s colt!”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;16 His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and had been done to him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the 9th of 10 prophecies by Matthew where he writes, “this took place to fulfill…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of His ministry, Jesus did not permit anyone to speak of His kingship. His usual response was “my hour has not yet come.” Then on this day, as Chuck Missler liked to say, “He not only permitted it, he arranged it.” As Lancaster writes, “Sending for a donkey…indicated a shift in public policy. He was ready to declare to Israel that He was her long-awaited Messiah-King.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;Lancaster notes that just about every donkey reference in the Hebrew Bible prefigures Messiah: from Genesis 22 and Abraham’s near-sacrifice of Isaac to Jacob’s donkey in Genesis 32 to Moses in Exodus 4 and so on. The Talmud records, “In the same way, the latter redeemer will come, as it is stated, “Humble and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Why not on a horse?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much is made of the fact that Jesus rode in on a lowly donkey when we might expect a king to ride in on a horse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prevailing theory by many Protestant commentators is the crowd should have known by the donkey that Jesus wasn’t going to be a conquering king this time. In his SECOND coming, he arrives on a horse. Revelation 19:11-16.  They imply that because Jesus entered on a donkey he was not coming as a king but as a servant to lay His life down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is half correct and half incorrect.  They are correct that a donkey signaled that He came in peace. Those in the crowd who expected a political, conquering King should have seen the sign.  They are incorrect that the donkey signaled He was not entering as a king.  The key word is &amp;ldquo;conquering.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lizorkin-Eisenberg notes that “when a city welcomed a victor with open arms WITHOUT an exercise of power, it was expected that the victor would enter on a donkey and not on a horse.”  Lizorkin-Eyzenberg says Revelation 19 still fits this model –At that point in the future, the world is being judged, and the people do not accept Christ willingly. So He comes as a conqueror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, BOTH times, he comes as a King; once in peace on a donkey; but the second as a conqueror in judgment on a horse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare Solomon, the &amp;ldquo;son of David,&amp;rdquo; assuming his throne on a donkey in 1 Kings 1:33.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they had accepted Him when He came in peace, there would have been no need for Him to return in judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allenby observes protocol in 1917&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the British General Allenby was preparing to take control of Jerusalem after world war I, on December 11, 1917, he rode his horse up to the Jaffa Gate on the west side of the city. He abruptly dismounted and entered the city on foot. The official record is that he did so out of respect for the holy city. He realized he was the first Christian in over 700 years to control Jerusalem, a city claimed by three faith traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also made this humble entry as an intentional or unintentional contrast to the German Kaiser Wilhelm II’s very pompous entry 20 years earlier (the Kaiser had part of the wall near the Jaffa Gate removed so his entourage could fit through). There is a legend that, privately, Allenby supposedly told one of his aides something like, “only one Man is qualified to enter this city on horseback, and that is not me.” That’s cool if it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 Most of the crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;9 And the crowds that went before him and that followed him were shouting, “Hosanna to the &lt;mark&gt;Son of David&lt;/mark&gt;! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 And many spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches that they had cut from the fields.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;9 And those who went before and those who followed were shouting, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;10 Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father, &lt;mark&gt;David&lt;/mark&gt;! Hosanna in the highest!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;36 And as he rode along, they spread their cloaks on the road.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;37 As he was drawing near—already on the way down the Mount of Olives—the whole multitude of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;38 saying, “Blessed is &lt;mark&gt;the King&lt;/mark&gt; who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13 So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying out, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the &lt;mark&gt;King of Israel&lt;/mark&gt;!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Whose King?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Matthew and Mark have the crowd referencing “son of David” while John says explicitly, “King of Israel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’ve occasionally noted in our series, Dr. Lizorkin-Eyzenberg believes John’s audience is writing to non-Judean Israelites, including the Samaritans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Samaritans did not care, let alone think, that their messiah would be a son of David. John wanted his audience to know that Jesus is KING OF ALL ISRAEL!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we indulge a thought that the four Gospels in some way could represent the pattern of spreading the good news in Acts 1:8. In that case, we could say that Matthew and Mark were writing to Jerusalem and all Judea (Jews) – Jews would be interested in the Messiah being a &lt;em&gt;son of David&lt;/em&gt;. Keener notes that during the Passover, which celebrates the deliverance of Israel from the house of bondage, “hopes for the restoration of the Davidic kingdom ran high.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John was writing to Samaria (and other non-Jews who believed in Israel’s God, though not necessarily through the tribe of Judah) – they wouldn’t care about being a son of David, but to them, Messiah is &lt;em&gt;king over all Israel&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke, a Gentile convert, was writing to the ends of the earth, the extent of the Roman empire. His audience wouldn’t care about a son of David or a king of Israel but simply needs to know that &lt;em&gt;Jesus is King&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Callout notes: &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern pilgrims carry palm branches in an annual reenactment of the Palm Sunday journey of Jesus&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we might miss, but the crowd in Jerusalem that day certainly knew, is that they viewed Jesus as their liberator against the corrupt Temple establishment and the Roman occupiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They reenacted the events in 1st Maccabees where a different group of Jews made a similar triumphal entry into Jerusalem after the successful revolt against the Greeks and Antiochus IV in 164 BC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the crowds going before Him, and those who followed, were shouting, “Hosanna . . . .”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosannah is a Hebrew phrase Hoshia Nah that means Save us now or save us, please. Hoshia is in the same word family as Yeshua, Salvation.“Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the LORD&amp;quot; comes from Psalm 118:25-6. Psalms 113-128 are known as Hallel Psalms. Lancaster notes that in its original 1st Temple usage, Psalm 118 celebrated a Judean King’s return from battle. Ever since, Jewish tradition held that Psalm 118 would herald the messianic redemption. The Talmud mentions explicitly that the waving of palm branches accompanies the singing of the Hallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was unmistakable what the crowd was communicating.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;A personal thank you to Chuck Missler&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a lot less crowded when Sarah and I did the Palm Sunday walk. Oddly enough, this is a busy street. Periodically we’d have to make way for a car. There was a car coming down and a car going up that had to navigate around each other at one point. That was entertaining.The man in the middle is Chuck Missler, who I frequently mention. This was in 2010, so he would have been about 75. Chuck had a tremendous impact on me and millions of others through his ministry. His unique background as a naval academy graduate and career as a secular executive before the transitioning to vocational ministry. I can’t say the transition to full-time ministry because his view is that we are ALL in the full-time ministry whether we know it or not. Chuck went to be with the Lord in 2018. Chuck taught me a love for God’s word and Israel. His arm is around my friend Peter from England and on his left is my friend Stuart from Australia. I know they have their backs to us, which breaks many rules of photography, but I still love and cherish this picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-cheapest-souvenir-in-israel&#34;&gt;The cheapest souvenir in Israel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Luke 19:39-40&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;39 And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples.”   40 He answered, “I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian commentaries typically see those self-righteous and, if I may say, “wascawy phawacees” at it again (many apologies to Elmer Fudd). If this is true, they ignored a fundamental tenet in the Art of War. Never interrupt your enemy when he is in the process of destroying himself. If I was Jesus&#39; enemy (GOD FORBID!) I might have been inclined not to say anything and let him get in trouble with the Romans for inciting an insurrection.Keener noted at Mark 11:1 that had the Roman garrison recognized the implications the crowd was making; they probably would have arrested him. Lancaster writes, “even those Pharisees who may have hoped the acclamations were true understood the grave political danger they were in by such an open proclamation. They feared for Yeshua’s life.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; You decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either case, Jesus&#39; reply says it all. Whereas before he said, “my time has not yet come,” He now says that creation can&amp;rsquo;t keep silent any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re probably wondering what this has to do with &amp;ldquo;the cheapest souvenir in Israel.&amp;rdquo; Unfortunately, a trip to Israel is not inexpensive. It’s been said that the best way to leave Israel with a small fortune is to enter Israel with a large fortune.But there is one free item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the stones that didn&amp;rsquo;t cry out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/IMG_1037.JPG&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m indebted to Chuck Missler for this tip. As you walk down the Palm Sunday Road, look for a rock. This has been more difficult since they paved the road a few years back, but there are still some spots where you can find them. Of course, it’s essential to make sure you aren’t disturbing anything that’s been intentionally put there, like landscaping or stones of remembrance at gravesites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you see one, pick it up. Then when you get home, and people ask you what it is, you can say, “that’s one of the stones that didn’t cry out. You know, from Luke 19:40?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they look at you puzzled, this allows you to dig into the passage where Jesus allows the people to proclaim him King, and he doesn’t stop them. Jesus here is proclaiming Himself to be the Messiah. From here, if your person is a non-believer, you can give them CS Lewis’ line about how He’s either lying, or he’s a lunatic, or if it’s neither one of those, he must be telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Part II, we will look at the remainder of the day, including Jesus weeping over Jerusalem and issuing a prophecy about the destruction of the city.  It&amp;rsquo;s a prophecy that , today, we can reach out, touch, and know it is fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Next Gospel Backgrounds Lesson: Triumphal Entry Part I</title>
      <link>https://talmidimway.com/post/next-gospel-backgrounds-lesson-triumphal-entry-part-i/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://talmidimway.com/post/next-gospel-backgrounds-lesson-triumphal-entry-part-i/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This lesson is titled “The Triumphal Entry” because we have finally arrived at the most significant week in all human history. The next seven days are a roller coaster of emotions, ending on the highest peak of all, the Resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 39 will be in two parts. Part I will review the Ascent of Adummim, which connects Jericho to Jerusalem. We’ll meet up with Jesus and the recently resurrected Lazarus in Bethany, look at how Jesus procures a donkey for his entry into Jerusalem, and examine the crowd’s reaction as they welcomed Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/2bafbd3f9ccec62efdf0eaf9ce825b36.png&#34; alt=&#34;Elevation from Jericho to Jerusalem&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson begins with Jesus and His talmidim leaving Jericho to make the 18-mile journey to Jerusalem. We can recreate this journey when we go to Israel (albeit from an air-conditioned bus with wi-fi). Although 18 miles is not that far, the elevation gain is steep, so one had to be in excellent physical shape to do it on foot. As the “Following the Messiah” hosts point out, it would be challenging to do that strenuous hike and carry on a conversation simultaneously. What was going through Jesus&#39; mind, knowing what would happen? What was going through the disciples&#39; minds, wondering what would happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, in John, we have the &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; wondering whether Jesus would come to the feast? This is an odd thought, as attendance at the feast was compulsory for all able-bodied Jewish men. In John 11:56-57, John distinguishes the “Ioudaioi” and the “chief priests and the Pharisees.” Not all “Jews” (&lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt;) were in on the plot, and we also know that not all Pharisees were in on the plot either (Nicodemus, for one). If we keep reading in John 12:9-11, we see that many &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/em&gt; were “believing in Jesus.” This was because of Lazarus&#39; testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/9aed9aa5c1d2045b2e8c5dbbf23fc17c.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;a donkey in Bethany Israel&#34; width=&#34;33%&#34; style=&#34;float:left&#34;/&gt;
We assume Jesus spends Shabbat (Friday sundown to Saturday sundown) with Mary, Martha, and Lazarus (John may be indicating this in John 12:2-8). Then on Sunday morning, Jesus gives instructions to procure a donkey. We briefly discuss whether this represents a prophecy or whether Jesus was taking advantage of the hospitality system of that day (perhaps combined with His familiarity with the area). Just as with the beggars in Jericho, Matthew says “a colt and his mother,” whereas Mark and Luke focus only on the “colt.” Matthew occasionally says there were two of something when Luke/Mark focuses on the more significant one (perhaps this is a result of his former job as a tax collector!).
&lt;p&gt;The Triumphal entry is a big deal for one primary reason. Every other time before this, when the people wanted to anoint Jesus as their leader, He said, “my hour has not yet come.” Now, Jesus not only permits it, but He also arranges it in a way that has direct parallels to Solomon, another “son of David.” He would ride a donkey into Jerusalem, indicating that he comes not as a conqueror but in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crowds shout “Hosanna” (Hebrew for “save us now” or “save us please!&amp;quot;) and wave palm branches, which was a direct allusion to the days of the Maccabees, who defeated the Seleucid Greeks in 166 BCE. In other words, they were encouraging Jesus to take over politically. They also chant Psalms 118, another messianic reference. It was unmistakable that they were crowning Jesus as the messiah, which Jesus is Ok with (Luke 19:40) .  The problem is (to borrow a quote), “this is not the messiah you’re looking for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/IMG_1037.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;33%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
To close the lesson, we look at the “cheapest souvenir in Israel.” When the Pharisees heard the people chanting that Psalm in THAT circumstance, they feared reprisal from the leadership, this is one indication that these Pharisees were not against Jesus but were on his side. They simply feared for his safety.
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “If these kept quiet, the very stones would cry out.” So the cheapest souvenir is to bring home one of the stones that didn’t cry out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part II will continue with Jesus weeping over Jerusalem, a precise prophecy that would be fulfilled around 40 years later, and other activities in the Temple.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Zacchaeus and Bartimaeus</title>
      <link>https://talmidimway.com/post/38-zaccheaus-and-bartimaus/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://talmidimway.com/post/38-zaccheaus-and-bartimaus/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This lesson is titled &amp;ldquo;Zacchaeus and Bartimaeus&amp;rdquo; because of the healings, one physical and one spiritual of Blind Bartimaeus and Zacchaeus, the wealthy tax collector. In Luke, Jesus also gives the double-parable of the Minas (Pounds) and the King&amp;rsquo;s Return. The lesson begins with Jesus passing through Jericho on His way up to Jerusalem for the Passover, where we are presented with two potential textual problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matthew says they were leaving Jericho, while Mark/Luke says they drew near to Jericho.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matthew says there were two beggars, while Mark/Luke list only one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both tensions are easily reconciled and need not distract us from the core teachings of the passage.  There are several lessons for us with the healing of Bartimaeus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/ad09ca3fccdb82076f4cf3d075fcbe64.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Sycamore tree in Jericho&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Luke alone tells the story of Zacchaeus, the repentant tax collector.  Zacchaeus would have been extremely wealthy, but mainstream Jewish society viewed tax collectors as outcasts.  To his credit, he wanted to see Jesus, and, as it turns out, Jesus wanted to see him. Zacchaeus was likely less than five feet tall, so he decided to climb a Sycamore tree to get a better view. Jesus notices the man in the tree, then says He &amp;ldquo;must&amp;rdquo; stay with him.  Apparently, without any prompting from Jesus, Zacchaeus pledges to give half his goods to the poor. To the extent he defrauded anyone (which he did), he promised to repay with 4x damages.  Jesus tells him, “Today salvation has come.” Jesus chose to honor an outcast, and he repented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke concludes this section with Jesus telling (but not explaining) two parables. Both fall into the category of “Journey parables.” With these parables in Luke 19, Luke makes it a point to tell us that Jesus told the parables “BECAUSE they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.” So whatever interpretation and application we come up with, it must connect somehow to the fact that (as we, the readers, know) the Messianic Kingdom did NOT appear immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is curious about these parables is that Jesus deliberately compares the King-on-a-journey to the hated and wicked Herod Archelaus. Archelaus was so bad even the Romans got rid of him.  So, the reader is presented with a curious question: if Jesus is allegorically speaking of Himself as the King in the parables, why would He so obviously compare Himself to the wicked Archelaus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video and lesson detail will explore some plausible interpretations and applications of these parables, including one that we might say goes against the grain of our typical expectations. We’ll don our “Acts 17:11 thinking caps” to work through these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson concludes with Luke writing, “when He had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.” In the next lesson, we will examine the Triumphal Entry, which is the first of the most significant seven days in all human history.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beyond the Jordan Part II</title>
      <link>https://talmidimway.com/post/beyond-the-jordan-part-ii/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://talmidimway.com/post/beyond-the-jordan-part-ii/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part II of the Gospel Backgrounds lesson titled, &amp;ldquo;Beyond the Jordan.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin the lesson, Jesus receives a question from a &amp;ldquo;rich, young ruler&amp;rdquo; about what must be done to inherit eternal life. We often think that the young man has a &amp;ldquo;works righteousness&amp;rdquo; mindset - in other words, if a person has enough good deeds, he or she will merit eternal salvation. This is true to some degree, but notice Jesus&#39; answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He doesn&amp;rsquo;t say &amp;ldquo;to get eternal life, all you need to do is accept Me into your heart.&amp;rdquo; In response to the immediate question, Jesus says first &amp;ldquo;keep the commandments&amp;rdquo;.  Then when pressed further, He says, &amp;ldquo;one thing you lack: sell everything, give it to the poor, then follow Me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that Jesus doesn&amp;rsquo;t rebuke the young man about being self-righteous, nor does Jesus correct the man&amp;rsquo;s errant theology. The man had a heart issue, not a head issue. There is a lot more going on with this exchange than it may first appear.  We will take a peek under the hood to get at some of the lessons for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/mat05686.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchange befuddles the disciples.  They &amp;ldquo;remind&amp;rdquo; Jesus that they HAVE left everything and followed their Rabbi as His talmidim.  Jesus assures them that their sacrifices will not go unrewarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 20 begins with one of my favorite parables, the parable of the workers.  A man needs workers for his vineyard.  He finds some early in the day, but also at various points throughout the day, including at the &amp;ldquo;11th hour&amp;rdquo; right before the work is to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the work is done, the owner calls the workers from last to first and, to the surprise of those hired early, everyone is paid a denarious, a full day&amp;rsquo;s wage.  Those hired early in the day gripe that this is unfair.  Is is right that someone who did 1/12 of the work get paid the same as those who did a full day&amp;rsquo;s work?  The owner replies that the first group agreed to the wage, and besides what He does with his money is his business and no one else&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parable is rich with meaning and has several practical and spiritual applications.  We will discuss a few of these in the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section concludes with Jesus receiving a request from James and John to sit at Jesus&#39; right and left hands during the millennial kingdom, which is often portrayed as a great banquet.  Instead of rebuking their pride, Jesus explains what it means to sit by his side and &amp;ldquo;drink His cup&amp;rdquo;.  This act of presumption, naturally, irks the other ten disciples.  Jesus explains that our mission as disciples is not to be serve but to serve.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beyond the Jordan Part I </title>
      <link>https://talmidimway.com/post/across-the-jordan/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://talmidimway.com/post/across-the-jordan/</guid>
      <description>&lt;img src=&#34;images/37.map.png&#34; title=&#34;map&#34; width=&#34;65%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gospel Backgrounds&lt;/em&gt; Lesson 37 is titled &amp;ldquo;Beyond the Jordan.&amp;rdquo;  We will do this in two parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After leaving the Harod Valley [#7 on the map], Jesus makes His way to the Jordan, just south of where it exits the Sea of Galilee.  The north-south path along the river in this vicinity was along the eastern shore, which the Gospel writers call &amp;ldquo;Judea beyond the Jordan.&amp;rdquo; [8]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus will engage a group of inquisitive (but not necessarily trecharous) Pharisees who want to know the Master&amp;rsquo;s position on divorce.  As it is today, divorce was a critical and controversial topic because of its impact on family and society.  The Pharisees themselves were divided on when divorce was permissible.  The majority view held that a man could divorce his wife for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; reason, including not liking her cooking or even finding another woman more attractive.  The minority view held that the Torah had in view sexual misconduct as the only permissible reason.  Jesus sided with the minority.  The disciples are so taken-aback by Jesus&#39; response that they exclaim &amp;ldquo;in that case, it is better not to marry!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus also teaches about the role of children and we will understand what it means to &amp;ldquo;become like a child&amp;rdquo; in order to enter heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Between Samaria and Galilee</title>
      <link>https://talmidimway.com/post/between-samaria-and-galilee/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://talmidimway.com/post/between-samaria-and-galilee/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gospel Backgrounds&lt;/em&gt; Lesson 36 is titled &amp;ldquo;Between Samaria and Galilee,&amp;rdquo; and is taken from Luke 17:11 where we are told Jesus is making his way up to Jerusalem for His final passover and passes between Samaria and Galilee.  The video will explore the geography of the region know as the Harod Valley, where many scholars believe this episode took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/36.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central story is that of Jesus healing ten lepers.  While all ten were healed, only one, a Samaritan, returned to give thanks and praise to Jesus.  In that day, most Jews had a dim view of Samaritans as evidenced by the three stories where Samaritans are featured prominently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Woman at the Well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The parable of the Good Samaritan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Ten Lepers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson for us is if even a Samaritan has enough heart to give thanks, how much more should we, as followers/disciples/talmidim of Yeshua have a humble and thankful heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;video&#34;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;
