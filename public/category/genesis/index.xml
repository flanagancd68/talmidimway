&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God creates the world in six days. On the first day He makes darkness and light. On the second day He forms the heavens, dividing the “upper waters” from the “lower waters.” On the third day He sets the boundaries of land and sea, and calls forth trees and greenery from the earth. On the fourth day He fixes the position of the sun, moon and stars as timekeepers and illuminators of the earth. Fish, birds and reptiles are created on the fifth day; land animals, and then the human being, on the sixth. G‑d ceases work on the seventh day, and sanctifies it as a day of rest.—Chabad.org&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;John 1:1-4, 10&lt;/sup&gt; In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made…. He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time, we looked at these seven profound words, the connection to John 1:1, and the fact that the world was made through Jesus, the  &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;א&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ת&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pattern of sevens is just getting started in this chapter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 45:18&lt;/sup&gt; For thus says the LORD, who created the heavens (he is God!), who formed the earth and made it (he established it; &lt;strong&gt;he did not create it empty&lt;/strong&gt;, he formed it to be inhabited!): “I am the LORD, and there is no other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Job 26:7&lt;/sup&gt; He stretches out the north over the void and hangs the earth on nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Jeremiah 4:23&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;I looked on the earth, and behold, it was without form and void; and to the heavens, and they had no light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;וְהָאָ֗רֶץ הָיְתָ֥ה תֹ֙הוּ֙ וָבֹ֔הוּ וְחֹ֖שֶׁךְ עַל־פְּנֵ֣י תְהֹ֑ום&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Veha’ARetz haytah TOhu vaVOhu, vCHOshech al p’nei t’home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton notes the passage expresses the sense of “that which has not yet been differentiated and assigned function. No boundaries or definitions have been established.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Gap Theory”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;תֹּהוּ&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;em&gt;tohu)&lt;/em&gt; is the word used in verse 2 for “waste, desolation, empty”. The same word is used in Isaiah 45:18, who says that God did NOT create the earth &lt;em&gt;tohu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There appears to be a contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this the so-called “gap theory” has emerged – they see some type of gap between verses 1 and 2, where some type of judgment occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try to support this, a minority of scholars would say the verse could be translated, “BUT the earth HAD BECOME formless and void.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, God created the earth to be perfect, but there was some kind of judgment causing it to become formless, void, and dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This judgment then led to the recreation of the surface of the earth in six days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keil &amp;amp; Delitzsch reject this concept. “Tohu alone is frequently employed as synonymous with non-existence (not becoming non-existent).”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember there is no life or death on earth until the Fall in chapter 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, people who try to put dinosaurs into this “gap” to conform with modern hypotheses about what killed the dinosaurs or reconcile with evolutionary theory are misguided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potentially it is when Satan fell, but even this theory has problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occam’s Razor tells us that the most straightforward explanation is usually the correct one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most straightforward explanation to reconcile Genesis 1:2 and Isaiah 45:18, is when God initially created the earth, He didn’t create it to be permanently formless and void (Isaiah).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was momentarily formless, void, and dark (possibly only for a fraction of an instant) until the Ruach Elohim went into action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage readers to hold very loosely to any man-made theory about what is going on in Genesis 1-6. We just don’t have a very good concept of what life was like before the Flood and even less insight about what life was like before the Fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Answers in Genesis site has an informative article on this topic: &lt;a href=&#34;https://answersingenesis.org/genesis/gap-theory/the-gap-theory-an-idea-with-holes/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Gap Theory – an Idea with Holes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that God specifically created the darkness - Isa 45:7 I form light and create darkness; I make well-being and create calamity; I am the LORD, who does all these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “deep” is a term surrounded in mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symbolically, the “deep” and “waters” suggest chaos (and were viewed as such by the ancients)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;td&gt;And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1 Jn 4:2&lt;/sup&gt; By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Luk 4:17, 21&lt;/sup&gt; He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me…” And he began to say to them, “Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gen Rabbah 1:2&lt;/sup&gt; “The Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters.” This was the Spirit of Messiah as it is written, “The Spirit of the Lord will rest on him.”&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mat 14:25&lt;/sup&gt; And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Lancaster, 3rd ed., vol. 4, Torah Club 3 (Marshfield, MO: First Fruits of Zion, 2015), 6.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;וְר֣וּחַ אֱלֹהִ֔ים מְרַחֶ֖פֶת עַל־פְּנֵ֥י הַמָּֽיִם&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;V’RUach Elohim m’raCHEphet al p’nei haMYim.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many see the plural &lt;em&gt;Elohim&lt;/em&gt; together with &lt;em&gt;Ruach&lt;/em&gt; (breath, wind, spirit) as a hint of the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a plain reading of the text doesn’t suggest the Christian Trinity, it’s not an unfair “deeper meaning” extrapolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Midrash, part of the Oral Torah we referenced previously, the Spirit of Elohim that hovered in Genesis 1:2 was the Spirit of Messiah; as their proof text, the rabbis quoted Isaiah 11, just as Jesus did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous lesson we established that Yeshua, the Aleph and the Tav, not only was present at the Creation, the Creation was achieved THROUGH Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We clearly have the Father, the Son, and the Spirit present at Creation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the complete passage in the Midrash references the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Form = Israel’s exile to Babylon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Void = Israel’s subjugation under Persia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darkness = Israel’s harsh treatment under the Greeks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep = Israel’s conquest by the Romans&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waters = Israel’s repentance in exile&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spirit of God = Messiah’s redemption of Israel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view parallels what we read in Daniel chapters 2 and 7, and throughout Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waters = chaos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heiser notes, “in the ancient world, the sea was a thing of dread. Unpredictable and untamable. The waters of the primeval deep must be calmed and restrained by God.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster writes, “When Messiah comes, He will transform the formless, the void, the darkness, the deep, and all the sorrows of this present age of exile into the light and joy of a new world and new creation.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus walked on the Sea of Galilee, it was not the first time God hovered above the chaos!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;td&gt;And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rev 21:23&lt;/sup&gt; And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Joh 8:12&lt;/sup&gt; Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1Jn 1:7&lt;/sup&gt; But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;VaYOmer Elohim “y’hi or,” vayahi or.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vayomer is the most frequently occurring verb in Hebrew – it means “and (he) said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vayomer Elohim means “and God said”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first recorded statement of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This light is not the sun, which won’t be created for a few more days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Light from God Himself, the Light of the Messianic Age – the same light we saw in Revelation chapters 21 and 22, where we have no more need for the sun, moon, and the stars for light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, note that the Light evidently will illuminate the entire earth at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**“**Rabbi Elazar said: The light that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created on the first day was not that of the sun but a different kind of light, through which man could observe from one end of the world to the other.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire Gospel of John has the themes of light versus darkness running through it;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John contrasts the Good Shepherd Jesus, versus the rejecting world, including the bad shepherds currently in control of the religious establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identical themes run through many of the Dead Sea Scrolls documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2 Co 4:6&lt;/sup&gt; For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Isa 60:1-2&lt;/sup&gt; Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the LORD has risen upon you. [2] For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the peoples; but the LORD will arise upon you, and his glory will be seen upon you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Joh 9:39&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus said, “For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Yalkut Shim’oni 11.499&lt;/sup&gt; This is the light of Messiah, as it is said, “God saw the light, that it was good.” Before the world was created, the Holy One, blessed by He, looked forward to the generation of Messiah. He hid the Light for Messiah beneath his throne of Glory.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vay’hi-erev, vay’hi voqer, Yom Echad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of seven “it was good” statements is given to the Divine Light&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the same light that will illuminate the Messianic Age (Revelation 21:23).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish days begin and end at sundown – literally and symbolically, each day moves from darkness to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our point of view is the opposite – light is swallowed up by the darkness (both daily, and at times metaphorically, when we see good being overtaken by evil).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From God’s perspective, it is just the opposite. Day follows night, darkness is dispelled by light, evil is conquered by good, and death gives way to light.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation chapters 19-22 give us the end of the story when the Light reigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Revelation chapters 13-18, as well as Isaiah 60:2, we also see that while the coming of Messiah brings light to believers, it brings darkness to the wicked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we said in the introduction, the Person whom we might call the “Divine Narrator” (i.e., some manifestation of God dictating to Moses), is not “trying to give us a modern scientific explanation of the origin of all natural phenomena,” such as light. With that noted, Chuck Missler, who has an engineering background sees God instituting order and the physical laws of the planet throughout the creation days (increasing in magnitude and specificity on each of the successive days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erev, according to Missler, suggests increasing chaos and increasing entropy. Erev gives way to Boker, which suggests increasing order and decreasing entropy.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day, as God originally designed it, there is no more Erev or Boker. The creation is complete and perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surface, what we might call “plain text,” reading is about physical light and physical darkness, but throughout the Bible, most notably in John’s writings, we see spiritual light versus spiritual darkness. Those who can see spiritually versus those who are spiritually blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, this is a cardinal, not an ordinal number. Not “the first day” (which would have been &lt;em&gt;yom rishon&lt;/em&gt;, but “day one”, &lt;em&gt;yom echad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1:1-5 in Hebrew is relatively easy to memorize. I encourage it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God made the expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse. And it was so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Psa 74:13,15&lt;/sup&gt; You divided the sea by your might; you broke the heads of the sea monsters on the waters. [15] You split open springs and brooks; you dried up ever-flowing streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2 Pe 3:4-5&lt;/sup&gt; They will say, “Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation.” For they deliberately overlook this fact, that the heavens existed long ago, and the earth was formed out of water and through water by the word of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2Ch 2:6&lt;/sup&gt; But who is able to build him a house, since heaven, even highest heaven, cannot contain him? Who am I to build a house for him, except as a place to make offerings before him?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no “it was good” for Monday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This passage invites a discussion on what we know about our atmosphere and space – as we mentioned in an earlier lesson, we would refer anyone interested to answersingenesis.org or Chuck Missler’s materials for a deeper discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, the word for sky and heaven is the same: shamayim. This is difficult because the sky we can see, space we can see (through a telescope) but that doesn’t mean we are looking into heaven where God dwells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solomon, in a moment of humility, acknowledged this in 2 Chronicles 2:6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes God going out of His way to dwell with us all the more incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-19-13---third-day-land-seas-trees-vegetation&#34;&gt;Gen 1:9-13 - Third Day: land, seas, trees, vegetation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Jer 5:22&lt;/sup&gt; Do you not fear me? declares the LORD. Do you not tremble before me? I placed the sand as the boundary for the sea, a perpetual barrier that it cannot pass; though the waves toss, they cannot prevail; though they roar, they cannot pass over it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the “it was good” statements contrast with how many ancients viewed the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To them the world was often unstable and threatening, such as when there were storms, floods, fire, droughts or earthquakes. The gods they had associated with these natural elements were seen as having the ability to be angered unless they were appeased in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton says, “That it was all ‘good’ reflects God’s wisdom and justice.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth.” And it was so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1Co 15:38-39&lt;/sup&gt; But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body. [39] For not all flesh is the same, but there is one kind for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Heb 6:7&lt;/sup&gt; For land that has drunk the rain that often falls on it, and produces a crop useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third day receives two “it was good” commendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps, this is a hint of the many blessings and other significant events that will occur on the “third day” throughout the Bible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler sees Job 38 as a parallel passage for the Third Day of Creation.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. And let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and let them be lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth.” And it was so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Deu 4:19&lt;/sup&gt; And beware lest you raise your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven, you be drawn away and bow down to them and serve them, things that the LORD your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rom 1:25&lt;/sup&gt; They exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancient cultures looked up at the sky in wonderment. They concluded that there must be a sun-god who controls the sun, a moon-god who controls the moon, and later a rain-god who controls the rain and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible refutes this directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible clearly teaches monotheism, which was in stark contrast to all of the other ancient cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nature, despite all its beauty and splendor, is not to be worshipped or considered as God.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one Creator. Everything else is the creation, and therefore beneath than the Creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteronomy 4 reminds us that only God is to be worshipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may find it silly to bow down to worship a wooden idol of a sun god, yet we may pursue a job at the expense of all other things, or we save up for that car we have to have, or we tell ourselves that if only we had {x}, then we would be happy. This is worshipping the creation just as much as bowing down to a sun-god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul in Romans 1 uses an interesting example of worshipping the creation. While it’s easy to point fingers at the sexual perversion around us (and I’m not saying we shouldn’t defend Biblical teaching on the subject in the right context), but let’s remember the things we do that are the equivalent of worshipping the creation rather than the Creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word for signs, is interestingly the same word for letter and has a cognate word in Akkadian that means “omen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, the other ancient societies feared the natural world and attributed such “unpredictability” to the gods behind the natural forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is going out of His way to remove any personification of nature for His people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each day has a cycle of setting and a rising sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each month has a cycle of the new moon to a full moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew month begins on the new moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like the Hebrew day, the month begins in darkness and moves to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year has a cycle of the seasons, marked by the (apparent) movement in the sky of the sun, and in some cases the paths of planets visible to the naked eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;And God made the two great lights—the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night—and the stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Psa 19:1-5&lt;/sup&gt; The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork. Day to day pours out speech, and night to night reveals knowledge. There is no speech, nor are there words, whose voice is not heard. Their voice goes out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tent for the sun, which comes out like a bridegroom leaving his chamber, and, like a strong man, runs its course with joy.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps to avoid having His people get confused with the sun-gods and the moon-gods of Israel’s neighbors, God avoid using names for the sun and the mood. They are only the greater light and the lesser light.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1Co 15:39&lt;/sup&gt; For not all flesh is the same, but there is one kind for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creation is increasing in complexity. Day five sees creatures with the following systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-modifying; self-programming, self-diagnostic, self-repairing, self-reproducing&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these systems are contained within the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such systems can’t “evolve; if any one of the systems fails, the animal dies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets worse: the systems are interdependent. All systems functioning from day 1 are required for survival. If one isn’t working, there is no chance of being fruitful and multiplying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most advanced of these is yet to come: the human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds—livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As opposed to simply saying “land creatures (as He essentially does with sea creatures and air creatures), he divides land-based creatures into three categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domestic animals, with whom man to this day shares a unique bond&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creeping things – a broad category that might include reptiles, amphibians, insects and perhaps microscopic organisms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beasts of the earth, i.e., wild, non-domesticated animals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Col 3:8-10&lt;/sup&gt; But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth. Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed &lt;strong&gt;in knowledge after the image of its creator&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mat 19:4 (Mar 10:6)&lt;/sup&gt; He answered, “Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Eph 4:24&lt;/sup&gt; and to put on the new self, &lt;strong&gt;created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Jas 3:9&lt;/sup&gt; With (our tongues) we bless our Lord and Father, and &lt;strong&gt;with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love your neighbor application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Pliskin says, “Love of one’s neighbor which is not motivated by the realization that man was created in God’s image is doomed to fail. When we realize that man alone is fashioned (in God’s image), he is suddenly transformed from an inconsequential being into one that is without parallel. He is the pinnacle of Creation.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mic 6:8 He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slightest act of lovingkindness pleases God because we are honoring another made in His image. This includes a smile to a stranger you will probably never see again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be a challenge to love our neighbor when he or she does not reflect the character of God. The same can be said of you and me when we don’t reflect the image of our Creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages debated which verse was more significant: Leviticus 19:18 or Genesis 1:27.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One sage who likely was unfamiliar with Luke’s gospel argued in favor of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His rationale was that the term “neighbor” could have a tendency to be narrowly defined as those who are like me. History bore this out in the parable of the Good Samaritan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that ALL mankind is created in His image means we don’t need to ask the question “who is my neighbor?” The answer is obvious. It includes people who are not like us as well as those who are. We also don’t GET to ask that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we view Genesis 2 as providing more detail on the creation of man (which is the viewpoint we recommend, as opposed to a chronological event following Genesis 1, or God-forbid, a conflicting creation account as some skeptics view it), then we see God was much more intimately involved with the creation of man than with any other body or being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lancaster quoting Rashi: “Everything else was created through an utterance of God, but man was created with God’s hands.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volumes have been written about what exactly it means to be made in God’s image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton defines as “(God’s) representative containing His essence.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He also adds, “(in other ancient cultures) it is only other gods who are made in the image of gods.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster suggests, being made in God’s image means, man alone has moral obligation to choose right but free agency to make that choice or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in some respects, I agree with this and it is certainly what differentiates humans from other created beings, Heiser disagrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Defining image bearing as ANY ability is a flawed approach.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, he states a human is born without any such ability and some never gain these abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The image is not an ability, but a status. To be human is to image God.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An apt parallel is to think of ourselves as ambassadors or agents of Yeshua with God as the principal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agent is granted authority (or “status”) by the principal to act on the principal’s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agent must put the principal’s interest above his own when going about the principal’s business (and we’re to be about God’s business 24/7/365).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a third party observes the agent, they draw conclusions about the nature, preferences, and character of the principal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agent’s behavior reflects the character of the principal (positively or negatively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a third party mistreats the agent, it is the same as if they mistreated the principal (read Revelation!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does the verse say “God said, ‘let Us…’?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Christians see the Trinity in view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creation of man is attributed to the Father in Genesis, to the Son in Colossians 1:16, and to the Spirit in Job 33:4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heiser cautions against reading the Christian trinity into Genesis 1:26-27: “Hebrew grammar and exegesis has shown that the Trinity is not a coherent explanation.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this may not be supported by the plain text, it’s not an unfair “deeper meaning” application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are exactly three instances of “image” in this passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 5:17 But Jesus answered them, “My Father is working until now, and I am working.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 14:23 Jesus answered him, “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others would say it’s the “plural of majesty,” such as when a king or queen says “we are not amused.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages, in a theory echoed by Michael Heiser, see a “divine council” of angelic beings with God in charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we have is a single person (God) addressing a group – the members of His divine council.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not imply creation was a group consensus or project. Genesis 1:27 tells us plainly that God did the creating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see this in various places, but perhaps this type of council is most obvious in 1 Kings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Ki 22:19-22 And Micaiah said, “Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, &lt;strong&gt;and all the host of heaven standing beside him on his right hand and on his left&lt;/strong&gt;; [20] and the LORD said, ‘Who will entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’ And &lt;strong&gt;one said one thing, and another said another. [21] Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD, saying, ‘I will entice him.’&lt;/strong&gt; [22] And the LORD said to him, ‘By what means?’ And he said, ‘I will go out, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And he said, ‘You are to entice him, and you shall succeed; go out and do so.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, God consulted with His counsel (though He certainly didn’t need to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there was some discussion, then God finally issued the decree on behalf of the council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Jewish tradition, there was a dispute among the angels AFTER God’s made this decision.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:21&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were simultaneously upset that God overruled their protests and became jealous when they saw Adam in his (unfallen) splendor and glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These angels descended into the created world and conspired with the serpent to plot against Adam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ezekiel 28, the oracle against the King of Tyre transforms into a lament over Satan. God says, “You were in Eden, the garden of God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the rest, as they say, is history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;td&gt;And God blessed them. And God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Eph 1:4&lt;/sup&gt; even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Col 3:10&lt;/sup&gt; and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that “all souls that existed from the time of Adam the first man until the end of time, were all created during the six days of creation. All of them were in the Garden of Eden.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:22&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ephesians teaches that some part of us, the part we typically call our spirit or soul, existed before our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will also live on after our body perishes until at some point in the future, our bodies and souls/spirits will be reunited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster comments that the people of the world limit the size of their families based on finances. This is to have a spirit of fear. The child of God has no need to fear, and we should trust in God’s commandment to be fruitful and multiply.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:23&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:23&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Adam and Eve lost Eden, they also lost much of their authority over creation. We await the new Eden (Revelation 22) when all will be restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James 3 contrasts the dominion we have been given with our inability to control our tongues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sup&gt;James 3:7-8&lt;/sup&gt; For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind, but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit. You shall have them for food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1 Ti 4:4-5&lt;/sup&gt; For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other ancients viewed the world as created for the gods and their enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The various elements of creation came about as a result of conflict among the gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man was only an afterthought when the gods realized they needed servants to do their bidding or worshippers to appease them.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:24&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:24&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible presents the creation as a controlled and intricately designed (as opposed to arbitrarily determined by the results of a supernatural conflict) process to be under the dominion of man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the beginning, God planned man as the centerpiece of His creation.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:25&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:25&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not yet death so there would be no killing of animals for food. Yet, for some reason, man has to eat, which does requires cutting off a plant from its lifesource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One argument is that God “permitted” man to eat (except of the two trees) for his pleasure and fellowship. They were not commanded to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another argument is that their (at that moment) eternally healthy state might have been preconditioned on keeping the body fueled with a plant-based diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-131-very-good&#34;&gt;Gen 1:31 VERY good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genesis 1:31&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Act 17:24-25&lt;/sup&gt; The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man, nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just good but “very good” – not just &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;טֹ֖וב&lt;/span&gt;, but &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;טֹ֖וב &lt;strong&gt;מְאֹ֑ד&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;מְאֹ֑ד&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deu 6:5 You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your &lt;strong&gt;might&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;וּבְכָל־מְאֹדֶךָ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word for might is &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;מְאֹ֑ד&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love Him with all your “veryness” – with every fiber of your being, (perhaps “Love Him with the entirety of God’s creation in you”) is the thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;מְאֹ֑ד&lt;/span&gt; has the same Hebrew letters as &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אָדָ֜ם&lt;/span&gt;, Adam, so the creation of Man/Adam was very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam is thought of as an acronym:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messiah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical creation is very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often deemphasize the physical aspect of our nature and stress the spiritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thinking has roots in Greco-roman philosophy as well as early Christian Gnostic heresy, which taught that the physical world was evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be cautious about the thinking “heaven is my real home” or “I’m just passing through on the way to heaven.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s creation is not to be rejected as evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A man will have to give an account on the judgment day for every good and permissible thing which he might have enjoyed and did not.” (y.Kiddushin 4:12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we studied in Revelation; the New Heaven, New Earth, and New Jerusalem are all physical places. The afterlife will be a corporeal physical existence.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:26&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:26&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2-summary&#34;&gt;Genesis 2: Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God ceases work on the seventh day, and sanctifies it as a day of rest. God forms the human body from the dust of the earth, and blows into his nostrils a “living soul.” Originally Man is a single person, but deciding that “it is not good that man be alone,” God takes a &amp;ldquo;side&amp;rdquo; from the man, forms it into a woman, and marries them to each other. Adam and Eve are placed in the Garden of Eden, and commanded not to eat from the “Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rev 21:1&lt;/sup&gt; Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Joh 19:30&lt;/sup&gt; When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, “It is finished,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rev 21:6&lt;/sup&gt; And he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Col 1:16&lt;/sup&gt; For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Eph 3:8-9&lt;/sup&gt; To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maimonides, a medieval Jewish sage states, “the Creator caused a repose to encompass the universe.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Perhaps this is when time actually began as the laws of nature were stabilized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no stated “evening and morning” for the seventh day. It was intended to be permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam and Eve’s decision disrupted this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our shabbat rest, we now look forward to the messianic age and the New heavens/New earth/New Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus promises us our Shabbat rest in Rev 21:6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psa 90:4 For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, or as a watch in the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages applied Psalms 90.4 to Shabbat and concluded that, since every day is as a 1000 years, there will be 6000 years of work, followed by a Shabbat rest of 1000 years corresponding to the Messianic rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 20:4 Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. Also, I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messianic Jews see a hint of this in the seven words of Genesis 1:1, which we discussed previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heb 4:9-11 So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God, [10] for whoever has entered God&#39;s rest has also rested from his works as God did from his. [11] Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joh 1:10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 4 has an exposition of the Shabbat rest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heb 4:1-11 Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it. [2] For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened. [3] For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, “As I swore in my wrath, ‘They shall not enter my rest,’” although his works were finished from the foundation of the world. [4] For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.” [5] And again in this passage he said, “They shall not enter my rest.” [6] Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience, [7] again he appoints a certain day, “Today,” saying through David so long afterward, in the words already quoted, “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.” [8] For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken of another day later on. [9] So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God, [10] for whoever has entered God&amp;rsquo;s rest has also rested from his works as God did from his. [11] Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer is saying that the Israelites rebelled in the wilderness and failed to enter in to the rest God had planned for them. Those who rebel against the word of Jesus were acting like Moses’ generation did.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 11:28 Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as surely as God created the first heaven and first earth and all that is within, He will one day pour out His judgment on that creation and usher in the New heaven and new earth for eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more I study about Shabbat, the more I come to the conclusion that the fact that Christians don’t observe it is we are being fed a lie by the enemy who doesn’t want us partaking in this institution of holiness and community with God and with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christianity sees the Shabbat as a difficult burden and one that Jesus did away with. If it is so burdensome, why do all Jews seem to delight in the Sabbath? We need to stop to ask why would Jesus do away with one of the 10 commandments; and if He did, what kind of Jewish messiah would violate one of the 10 commandments? Join us in our Gospels study as we will take a hard look at at the so-called Sabbath controversies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a gift from God and maybe we should think hard about whether such a gift should be ignored or declined. Some say Sunday is the Christian sabbath. You won’t find this so defined in the Bible, but let’s grant it for a moment. How many Christians truly hit pause on their lives for more than the handful of hours they may be at church on Sunday, versus a full 24-hour shutdown period?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the business of today’s world, a person feels like he or she does not have time to stop even for a single day. (In contrast) the commandment of Shabbat forces us to stop and remember who created time. Sabbath sets aside one day out of a week to remember that we serve God, not ourselves, not our jobs, and not Pharaoh.” Daniel Lancaster&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens. When no bush of the field was yet in the land and no small plant of the field had yet sprung up—for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the land, and there was no man to work the ground, and a mist was going up from the land and was watering the whole face of the ground—&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mar 13:19 For in those days there will be such tribulation as has not been from the beginning of the creation that God created until now, and never will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rom 1:19-20 For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. [20] For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liberal theologians, skeptics and critics have big problems with the narration in chapter 2 which they see as contradicting the creation story in chapter 1. You may encounter these views so it’s worth taking some time to become acquainted with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the skeptic sees no vegetation, then man created in verse 7, and then vegetation, in verse 9; all of which would be a contradiction of the order in chapter 1. As we’ve discussed, our western minds tend to be focused more on strict chronology than eastern thinking. There is nothing in this passage that textually requires verse 9 to chronologically follow verse 7. We described man; now we’re describing the Eden in which God will place man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plausible explanations that do not involve assuming different authors or errors in the text. The most basic of these is to view chapter two as God returning to the creation of Adam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s as if after chapter 2, verse 3 and the seven days of creation, someone, let’s say an angel, asked God, “can you tell me more about this man creature?” God then replies, “Sure, let me tell you more about Man. You see I’m so close to man that I use my covenant name when I interact with him.” Then God tells the story beginning with verse 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to our verse and our chronology discussion, Walton states, “the reference (in 2:5) is not to a time before day three but to the fact that agriculture was not taking place.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are reminded that there was no rain until the flood. The earth had an entirely different hydrological cycle before the Flood, which was likely still different from the environment before the Fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another facet noted by critics is that in Chapter 1 God describes Himself as “Elohim,” whereas in Chapter 2, we see the covenant name of God, the Tetragrammaton, which is typically styled as LORD in our English Bibles. (On that note, we nowhere see Jesus pronouncing this Name, so I’m not comfortable doing so. It appears Jesus honored the tradition never to pronounce this name, and instead used what are called circumlocutions). This has led these skeptics and critics to conclude that two different authors an “E” source (for Elohim) and a “Y” source composed the two “conflicting” chapters. The general name for this more liberal view of scripture is the “Documentary hypothesis” or the “Graft-Wellhausen hypothesis.” They also see a priestly (P) source and a Deuteronomic (D) source as contributing authors. In other words, Moses didn’t write the books of Moses according to the theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will see that in Mark 10 and Matthew 19, Jesus quoted from both chapters 1 and 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mar 10:3-8 He answered them, “What did Moses command you?” They said, “Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and to send her away.” [And Jesus said to them, “Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment. But from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’ [Gen 1:27] ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife and the two shall become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two but one flesh. [Gen 2:24]. In other words, Jesus quotes from the so-called “E” source (chapter 1) and the so-called “Y” source (chapter 2) and sees no problem with attributing them both to Moses. John 7:19 Has not Moses given you the law?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A close relative of the documentary hypothesis is called the “Deutero-Isaiah theory.” This theory says that a single person did not write Isaiah. Chapters 1-39 are from one author, possibly the original Isaiah, while 40-66 were written after the fact, possibly by one or more of Isaiah’s disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John 12 we have two quotes from Isaiah, one from each of the two sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joh 12:37-41 Though he had done so many signs before them, they still did not believe in him, so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: “Lord, who has believed what he heard from us, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?” [Isaiah 53:1] Therefore they could not believe. For &lt;strong&gt;again Isaiah said&lt;/strong&gt;, “He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, lest they see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and turn, and I would heal them.” [Isaiah 6:10].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with Moses, the Holy Spirit authenticates Isaiah. John 12:40 could be interpreted as “that SAME Isaiah said again…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a similar theory that says Daniel didn’t really write Daniel. The prophecies are in such dramatic detail, that doubters have to conclude that all of Daniel was written after the fact. Again Jesus says in Mat 24:15, “…spoken of by Daniel the prophet….”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while the man says we should question Moses, Isaiah, and Daniel, Jesus authenticates the authorship of all three. It’s as if the Bible anticipated hostile jamming! As Chuck Missler said, “If you believe Jesus, you’ve got no problem with the authorship of Genesis. If you don’t believe in Jesus, you’ve got much bigger problems than the authorship of Genesis.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;then the LORD God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature. And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1Ti 2:13-14 For Adam was formed first, then Eve; [14] and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Co 15:45-48 Thus it is written, “The first man Adam became a living being”; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit. [46] But it is not the spiritual that is first but the natural, and then the spiritual. [47] The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven. [48] As was the man of dust, so also are those who are of the dust, and as is the man of heaven, so also are those who are of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to speaking into existence, God creates man by direct involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man&amp;rsquo;s physical and spiritual aspects are seen in the ground dust and God’s personal breath of life. Human life is a deliberate creation by God. This gives us purpose and dictates how we should treat ourselves and each other. Today’s world tells us we are just a cosmic accident and have no meaning. This worldview also dictates how they would have us should treat ourselves and each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster writes, “Our job is to cultivate the godly side of our nature and integrate it into the earthly side. Our job is to reveal heaven on earth.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Living creature” is an odd translation option by the ESV. The Hebrew word is “Nefesh,” which is most often rendered, soul. Denotatively it can refer to any living animal, though nephesh tends to be limited to mankind outside of the creation story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages read this as “a soul which can speak. Man, then, is elevated above all animals, for God has given him the ability to speak. However, this faculty elevates man only when he uses it for worthy purposes. Someone who misuses his speech by speaking against others is considered lower than a beast. A beast cannot destroy through talk, whereas man can slay with his tongue. (Chofetz Chayim)”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Adam was not deceived” is a staggering statement. That means Adam knew exactly what He was doing when he ate the fruit. Is this deliberate rebellion, or is something deeper possibly going on? We’ll look at that next lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;And out of the ground the LORD God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rev 2:7 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 22:14 Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life and that they may enter the city by the gates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eden means “delight” in Hebrew. In the Greek Septuagint, the translators selected the word for “paradise.” Adam had everything he could have wanted, including eventually a helper. The tree of life represents immortality; this is how Jesus references it in Revelation. Saying we will eat of the tree of life is to say we will have eternal life. The issue with the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil is that it includes a knowledge of death. We’ll continue this thought in verse 16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers. The name of the first is the Pishon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rev 22:1-2&lt;/sup&gt; Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Joh 7:38&lt;/sup&gt; Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, ‘Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we saw in the final chapters of Revelation, the Garden of Eden “corresponds to paradise, the Messianic Age, and the World to come. In the Messianic Era, a river will flow out of Eden again in the form of a might river that flows forth from the holy Temple and from Jerusalem.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 2:13-14&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The name of the second river is the Gihon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Cush. And the name of the third river is the Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably ever since the story of Genesis 2 was first told by Moses, people have wondered where exactly Eden was. Verse seven only tells us that it was in the east. The Tigris and Euphrates originate in the Armenian mountains (where Mt. Ararat happens to be), but post-flood, we are dealing with a very different terrain today than would have existed in the days of Adam. “Gihon” happens to be the name of the only freshwater spring in Jerusalem. From this are both Jewish and Muslim traditions that the “rock” that is presently enshrined by the Dome of the Rock is the foundation stone for the entire earth. Jewish tradition holds that the Temple represented Eden on earth, “the paradise where man can enter into God’s presence.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Walton speculates, “the characteristics of a well-watered garden in which humans do little or no work and in which life springs up without cultivation fits the marshy areas at the base of the (Persian) Gulf and may even be an area now covered by the waters of the region.”[^11][^13]
&lt;p&gt;In Revelation, the World to Come, the New Jerusalem will stand within the restored Garden of Eden, where a river will flow out of it and a tree of life will grow. Perhaps the Jerusalem connection is more than just tradition!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 2:15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;גַן&lt;/span&gt;, the word translated “garden” does not typically refer to vegetable plots but to orchards or parks containing trees.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-216-17--warning-about-tree-of-knowledge&#34;&gt;Gen 2:16-17 – Warning about Tree of Knowledge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 2:16-17&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, “You may surely eat of every tree of the garden, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Deu 30:19&lt;/sup&gt; I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Therefore choose life, that you and your offspring may live,&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man was not initially forbidden from eating from the Tree of Life. A part of being human, a part which God did not restrict in the Garden, is the ability to choose good or evil, life or death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discipleship precept: most every choice we make involves a decision to live for God or live for ourselves. In this respect, we are choosing between the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil several times a day. God desires that we choose the way of Life (see Deu 30:19), but He allows us to decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-218-24--not-good-to-be-alone&#34;&gt;Gen 2:18-24 – Not Good to be Alone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 2:18-20&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Then the LORD God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.” Now out of the ground the LORD God had formed every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name. The man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper fit for him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the seven “goods” in chapter one, we now have a “not good” in chapter 2. Man’s loneliness, and perhaps by application after the fall, a man’s tendency to isolate from the community, is called “not good” by God. Selfishness and solitary independence are not in God’s will. “In embracing the “other” our capacity is extended to embrace our Father-God in a growing, every more intimate relationship.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you are specifically called by God to separate yourself for ministry (Matthew 19:12), a permanently single life should not be a desire. Sages see the text implying Adam was aware of his loneliness, particularly after naming what presumably were pairs of animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desire for love, affection, admiration, and community are more of what it means to be human (even though I think my dogs demonstrate these traits, if I didn’t feed them, they’d probably not be so affectionate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He brought them to the man to see what he would call them.” – God delights in man’s wonder and creativity. The naming of a thing was to declare dominion over it; this is why it is not to be overlooked when demons tell Jesus “We know who you are” and when Jesus asks for their names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 2:21-22&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. And the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Eph 2:19-22&lt;/sup&gt; So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, [20] built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, [21] in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord. [22] In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, God separates and forms Eve with His hands. It’s been said that to create Eve below the mid-section would imply Eve is inferior. To create Eve from above the heart would imply Adam is inferior. Instead, God chose to make Eve an equal. In removing a structure designed to protect the vital organs, man is also made vulnerable in marriage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word translated as “made” is actually the verb “built.” Lancaster believes Paul is directly referencing this Hebrew word in Genesis 2:22 in his passage in Ephesians 2 talking about the ecclesia being joined to her Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discipleship precept: “Adam’s state of unconsciousness at the time of the creation of Eve illustrates how a husband should relate to his wife. He should act as if he were asleep and overlook minor faults in order to avoid domestic quarrels.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Another sage said, “the true test of a person’s propensity toward anger is judged by his behavior in the circle of his own family, which will undoubtedly provide opportunities for anger.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a potential parallel here. The first Adam’s sleep corresponds to the second Adam’s death. Just as Even was made in Adam’s “absence”, so also was the Ecclesia made in Messiah’s absence. Just as the First Adam awoke to be united with his bride, Eve, Jesus will one day “awaken” to be reunited with His bride, the ecclesia. Paul builds on this symbolism in Ephesians 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Then the man said, “This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Eph 5:29-32&lt;/sup&gt; For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church, [30] because we are members of his body. [31] “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” [32] This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to &lt;strong&gt;Christ and the church.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2 Cor 5:17&lt;/sup&gt; Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bride of Adam is from the body of Adam. The Bride of Messiah is from the body of Messiah. Eve is a new creation. In Messiah, we are a new creation. 2 Cor 5:17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God uses the model of marriage to communicate His deepest truths. I can’t wait until we get to Genesis 24 and the marriage of Isaac and Rebekah. Typology is everywhere. Until then, just as we are called to leave the household of our youth and be joined with our husband or wife, Jesus calls us to leave or former lives of idolatry and sin behind and become joined with him as a pure, spotless bride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become &lt;strong&gt;one flesh.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mar 10:6-9/Mat 19:5 But from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’ [7] ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, [8] and the two shall become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two but one flesh. [9] What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Co 6:15-17 Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never! [16] Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, “The two will become one flesh.” [17] But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, one flesh is besar echad. This is where we get the idea of the word “echad” representing a compound unity. So in Deuteronomy 6:4, when we read, “The LORD is our God, the LORD is one (echad),” this need not exclude the Christian concept of a triune God. Those typically traditionally Jewish, see Christianity as worshipping three gods, but they are misunderstanding the trinity (to be fair, the trinity is a complex topic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besar echad is a uniquely human characteristic. Lower animals temporarily join for the purpose of procreation, but man is sanctified in marriage. Here are some writings collected by Pliskin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He should honor his wife more than himself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“(Each) should do as the other desires and refrain from doing whatever the other dislikes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If a husband will try to fulfill his obligations and the wife will try to fulfill her obligations, they will live a happy and tranquil life together. Troubles begin when the husband is only concerned that the wife meet her obligations to him, and the wife is only concerned that the husband meet his obligations to her.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attempts by society to cheapen and weaken the institution of marriage are nothing new. We will note many of the patriarchs and kings of Judah/Israel have multiple wives, but it’s important to note that God never sanctioned this, in the same way God permits divorce in Deuteronomy 24 but does not sanction it. In Mark 10, Jesus emphasizes that from the beginning a single, lifelong monogamous relationship was God’s original design and cites both Genesis 1:27 and 2:24 as His “proof texts.” Jesus apparently had no problem with the two “different” Creation stories in Genesis 1 and 2. What might be lost on modern readers, is that he is also applying the definition of adultery equally to men and women. In that day, fornication and adultery had two different definitions, which resulted in a married man being able to engage in a relationship with a single woman virtually without penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one example where less-informed Christians say “Jesus is overturning the Law.” He’s doing nothing of the sort. He’s restoring the definition to God’s original intent and citing the Torah as His basis for doing so. In so doing, Jesus leveled the playing field by placing husband and wife on equal footing and limits disciples of Jesus to a single wife. Interestingly, documentation from the Dead Sea Scrolls imposed similar definitions and prohibitions on their Qumran community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-225---naked-in-the-garden-of-pleasure-and-delight&#34;&gt;Gen 2:25 - Naked in the garden of pleasure and delight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 2:25&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Heb 13:4 Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is God’s design for sexuality. It is not sinful, shameful, or perverse. It is a wicked world that makes it that way by presenting a skewed vision, if not an outright mockery of God’s original plan for a husband and wife to be one flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divorce and inappropriate relationships before and outside of marriage (physical or electronic) are damaging. If anyone reading is caught up in sexual sin, please seek wise Christian counsel. There is help and countless others have broken these chains of shame and immorality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fully used for God’s service we must be pure, undefiled, and unashamed. Just like Adam and Eve were in the “Garden of Pleasure and Delight”. The fact that this very phrase sounds “r-rated” and selacious to our ears signifies how much Satan and the world make a mockery of God’s design. We associate these things with Las Vegas, when we should be associating them with our marriages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew words for man and woman are &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;איש&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אשה&lt;/span&gt; (Ishah = woman, ish = man)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two unique letters are  &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;י&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ה&lt;/span&gt;, which spell &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;יה&lt;/span&gt;, Jah, the short-form of God’s holy name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you take God out of a marriage, the two remaining letters are &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;א&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ש&lt;/span&gt;, which spells &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אֵשׁ&lt;/span&gt;, or “fire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Akiva said, “when a marriage is godly and the marriage bed is kept pure, God is present with husband and wife. When a marriage is godless and the marriage bed is defiled, it is a consuming fire that will destroy both.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true for an unmarried “ish” or “Isha” who is using sex outside of the proper, God-designed context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no God, there is only destructive fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, when we have a God-honoring marriage, with God involved, we have a taste of what it was like in Eden.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt;
At the end of chapter two, Adam and Eve are placed in the Garden of Eden and commanded not to eat from the “Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.” The serpent persuades Eve to violate the command, and she shares the forbidden fruit with her husband. Because of their sin, it is decreed that man will experience death, returning to the soil from which he was formed and that all gain will come only through struggle and hardship. Man is banished from the Garden.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-31-5-the-serpent-casts-doubt-on-the-word-of-god&#34;&gt;Genesis 3:1-5 The Serpent casts doubt on the Word of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col style=&#34;width: 50%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&#34;width: 50%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 3:1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God actually say, ‘You shall not eat of any tree in the garden’?”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rev 20:2 &lt;/sup&gt;And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2 Cor 11:3&lt;/sup&gt; But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Eze 28:13-15&lt;/sup&gt; You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering, sardius, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, emerald, and carbuncle; and crafted in gold were your settings and your engravings. On the day that you were created they were prepared. [14] You were an anointed guardian cherub. I placed you; you were on the holy mountain of God; in the midst of the stones of fire you walked. [15] You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created, till unrighteousness was found in you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:65%;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK a talking snake is a bit unusual. According to Jewish legend, Lucifer was enraged at God’s decision to create man, whom Lucifer no doubt viewed as a threat to his own status (and still does) he departed from God’s council and inhabited the snake. The serpent may in fact be the first case of demon possession in Scripture. We aren’t told much about the fall of Satan/Lucifer. In fact Heiser asserts that the Satan of Job chapter 1 and the serpent here were not originally the same being. The Satan, which means accuser, appeared to be serving the role of a court-appointed prosecutor, a role that apparently did exactly what God wanted him to do. The word Satan never appears in the Torah. In fact, it’s only in 11 verses in Job, two verses in Zechariah and one verse in 1 Chronicles. The word “devil” never appears in the Hebrew Bible. Later in Jewish history, the serpent of Eden, the devil, and the Satan of Job become co-mingled. After Genesis 3, the word serpent is typically only used to mean a snake, not a supernatural fallen angel By the time of Revelation at the end of the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century, the serpent, the devil, and the satan are all the same entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 14 and Ezekiel 28 are the two chapters that give us some biography of Satan, with Ezekiel 28:13 stating he was in Eden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler says there are two basic errors we make regarding Satan (and Lancaster reports that throughout history, Judaism makes the same two errors):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretend he doesn’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view holds that the devil is merely an abstraction or a symbol of man’s evil inclination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, &amp;ldquo;he&amp;rdquo; authors evil and seizes upon every evil opportunity.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was real in the life of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live in fear of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who do this are paralized and see the devil as behind &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; that is not right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Jn 4:4 Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The serpent uses the same basic approach as advertisers do today. FOMO. Fear of missing out. From the Wikipedia entry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear of missing out&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;FOMO&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The feeling of apprehension that one is either not in the know or missing out on information, events, experiences, or life decisions that could make one&amp;rsquo;s life better.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOMO is also associated with a fear of regret which may lead to concerns that one might miss an opportunity for social interaction, a novel experience, a memorable event, or a profitable investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is characterized by a desire to stay continually connected with what others are doing, and can be described as the fear that deciding not to participate is the wrong choice.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the FOMO was the chance to be like God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col style=&#34;width: 50%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&#34;width: 50%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 3:2-3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but God said, ‘You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rev 22:18-19&lt;/sup&gt; I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, [19] and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note Eve’s name is not mentioned here, which reminds me of Matthew’s genealogy where Bathsheba is referred to only as “the wife of Uriah.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/eve-touch.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commentators have chastised her for adding to the word of God here. We do not have it recorded that God didn’t command them to touch it. Adding to God’s word is something cults do and it leads to theological danger. When we add to God’s word, we give Satan an opportunity to twist and manipulate Scripture. All that is true and we should never say that God said something He never said. If this is truly what she did, she’s wrong. With that said, my thought here is with respect to Eve, this is much ado about nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judaism is known for putting fences or hedges around prohibited activities, and our churches do the same thing by the way. I’ve mentioned the fact that the Bible does not prohibit drinking alcohol; the Bible prohibits being drunk from alcohol. Many churches add a hedge that prohibits its members, or at a minimum, its leadership from drinking alcohol. Why? If you don’t drink alcohol, then you won’t get drunk. I’m not saying it’s necessarily a bad rule in many situations, but we need to realize it’s man’s rule, not God’s. Churches that do this are just as guilty of “adding to God’s word” as Eve is here. In the same way, if the rule is not to eat the forbidden fruit, then it seems like a wise plan not to touch it. If you don’t touch it, you probably won’t be in any danger of eating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, Adam and Eve walked with God and therefore they had many conversations that weren’t recorded. We don’t know with absolute certainty that God did NOT in fact say, “neither shall you touch it”; however, it was not accurate to say hyper-literally that merely touching the fruit would directly result in death. To be sure, touching it indirectly led to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume Eve was being reasonably factual here and move on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 3:4-5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;But the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;John 8:44&lt;/sup&gt; You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing good from evil sounds like the mark of wisdom. Why would God not want His creation to be able to differentiate? Further, why would God put something he didn’t want His people to do in the Garden? Isn’t that entrapment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often think of “evil” as a state; so in our view, what’s the problem of knowing about something as long as you don’t partake? Hebraic thought is much more action oriented. So, in Hebrew, evil means bad things happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a tragedy, we frequently hear, “how can a good God let this happen?” This is a difficult question and, when one is going through a trial, it seems to be reasonable to ask. Many have asked a similar question here. Why would God place the serpent and the tree in the Garden knowing they would fail. The answer is simple. To be human means we have to make choices. “It was important to God that human beings be free creatures with real choices&amp;hellip;If God had created a world where evil was not possible, it would also preclude the possibility of good.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John 8, we might say the religious rulers brought a knife to a gun fight. They made a not-so-subtle jab at Jesus’ presumed illegitimate father in verse 39. “Where is your father?” Jesus turns around and tells them who THEIR father is! John 8 has the tensest, most combative exchange in the Gospels. Those of us who secretely have a mischevious side, tend to love John 8&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1Co 10:13-14&lt;/sup&gt; No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it. Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1 Tim 2:14&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Ex 32:31-32&lt;/sup&gt; So Moses returned to the LORD and said, “Alas, this people has sinned a great sin. They have made for themselves gods of gold. But now, if you will forgive their sin—but if not, please blot me out of your book that you have written.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Joh 15:13&lt;/sup&gt; Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are told that because of FOMO, the woman ate it and gave it to the man to eat. We are not told what kind of fruit it was. Jewish tradition holds that it was a fig (likely because of the next verse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see a theme that will be repeated in the Bible, most notoriously of David’s sin with Bathsheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not where we’re supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see something pleasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We desire it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We touch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We partake in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can summarise this by saying 1) Doubt God’s Word (Did God really say?); 2) Deny God’s word (God never said that!); 3) Rationalize our behavior (see? We’re not dead and it was pleasant).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 10:13 reminds us that each choice has a way out. It’s as if God puts stop signs that we blow right through. Just because you see doesn’t mean you have to covet. Just because you covet doesn’t mean you have to touch. Just because you touch doesn’t mean you have to take, and so on. There may not be any immediate negative reaction either. Eve initially said that if she touched it she would die. That didn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;adam-knew-what-he-was-doing&#34;&gt;Adam knew what he was doing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we noted last lesson, Paul makes it very clear that Eve was deceived but Adam was not. While this passage is often used to browbeat Eve, I think something else is going on. If Adam wasn’t deceived, that means he intentionally and deliberately ate the forbidden fruit. He knew EXACTLY what he was doing. Perhaps he didn’t appreciate all of the ramifications, but he knew the general consequence for disobedience (“you shall surely die”) yet did it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Was this deliberate rebellion? Missler says no; in fact Adam was modeling Jesus. He paints a great visual of what it might have been like in that moment where Eve had sinned and Adam hadn’t yet. “Wow, kid. You really messed up. You’re going to get it when dad finds out. I’m still ok. I haven’t done anything wrong, but you. Wow. I’ll be sure to pray for you.” That’s how WE would probably respond, but that’s not how Adam responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He knew what he was doing and what the consequences would be. Try this theory on for size: Adam willingly laid his life down to join Eve in her predicament rather than let Eve languish alone for eternity. This is something Moses offered to do after the Golden Calf incident. In Exodus 32:32, Moses says “blot me out of your book of life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, had Adam not joined Eve, there would have been no Messiah and thus no means of salvation for Eve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is a picture of Jesus, the sinless second Adam who laid down his life for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;firstsecond-adam-comparison&#34;&gt;First/Second Adam Comparison&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul draws several comparisons between Adam and Jesus the second Adam. It is helpful to view these side-by-side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Romans 5:15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Many died through one man&amp;rsquo;s trespass&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Romans 5:16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The judgment following one trespass brought condemnation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The free gift following many trespasses brought justification&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Romans 5:17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Because of one man&amp;rsquo;s trespass, death reigned through that one man&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Much more those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness will reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Romans 5:18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;One trespass led to condemnation for all men&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;One act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Romans 5:19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;by the one man&amp;rsquo;s disobedience the many were made sinners&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;by the one man&amp;rsquo;s obedience the many will be made righteous&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 Corinthians 15:21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;by a man came death&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 Corinthians 15:22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;in Adam all die&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;in Christ shall all be made alive&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 Corinthians 15:45&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The first man Adam became a living being&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;the last Adam became a life-giving spirit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 Corinthians 15:46&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The spiritual is not first, but the natural&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Then the spiritual&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 Corinthians 15:47&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The first man is from the earth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The second man is from heaven&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 Corinthians 15:48&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;As is the earthly, so also are those who are earthly&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And as is the heavenly, so also are those who are heavenly&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 Corinthians 15:49&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Just as we have born the image of the earthly&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;We will also bear the image of the heavenly&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking in His Dust – At Genesis 3:6, Pliskin draws a seemingly odd conclusion about how we should put “love your neighbor” into practice. We may never be in a position to lay down our lives for our friends, but Pliskin writes of a much more immediate and practical application, “we should look for opportunities to save others from embarrassment.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In a sense, this is what Adam did. He didn’t let her suffer alone. Pliskin includes a few anecdotes from Jewish writings but here is a simple one. At Passover, a guest accidentally spilled some wine onto the tablecloth. Noticing his guest&amp;rsquo;s embarrassment, the host discreetly shook the table so that his cup of wine also tumbled over. “Something must be wrong with the table. It’s not standing properly.” At times, this may mean sacrificing a bit of our dignity to cover for another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 3:7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The serpent did not lie about their eyes being opened; like a slick salesman, he sold them on the benefits while glossing over the risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s very interesting that we don’t usually associate the fall with anything sexual, but apparently, their formerly pure sexual identity was the first thing they lost. It is not always polite to discuss but to be human is to be uniquely sexual. When we realize this, it is no wonder why Satan’s biggest attacks throughout history and to this very day seem to be related to sex. The human sex drive was twisted into something even from the very start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sewing the fig leaves (ouch) has been described as the first act of religion in the Bible. Mr. and Mrs. Man’s attempt to cover their sin by their own efforts. By the end of the chapter, God will show us His way of covering sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 3:8-9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden. But the LORD God called to the man and said to him, “Where are you?”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Jewish tradition holds that they weren’t actually nude as we think of it but Adam and Even were clothed with light, in other words not merely a physical but a spiritual garment. This allowed Adam and Eve to communicate directly with God. After the Fall, they lost this spiritual garment and were no longer able to speak as they once did. This even affected they way they heard God’s voice. Instead of directly, Adam now heard God’s voice only indirectly. Instead of pleasing, it was now terrifying. He could only hide in fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we’re feeling distant from God, we’re the ones who moved. God is seeking us out. A shepherd always seeks the sheep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Does God really see everything I do?” “God loves you so much He can’t take His eyes off you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be said of every other religion that it is man’s search for God. In contrast, the Judeo-Christian faith is about “God’s search for man.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 3:10-11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And he said, “I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.” He said, “Who told you that you were naked?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1 Co 6:15&lt;/sup&gt; Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, note the sexual connotation in this passage. We think of sinning against God as something spiritual, which of course it is. But it’s not JUST spiritual. To separate the physical from the spiritual as is common in Christianity today may be another attack from the enemy. Spirit good, flesh bad goes back to Gnostic heresy in the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; centuries. The lessons from scripture is the opposite of this: how we use our physical bodies directly affects our relationship and fellowship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 3:11-13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?” The man said, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate.” Then the LORD God said to the woman, “What is this that you have done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much is made of Adam’s passing the buck here. The common interpretation goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“when God confronted Adam on his sin, he refused to take accountability and instead attempted to shift the blame to Eve. Adam even takes a parting shot at God by implying that God is somehow responsible for Adam’s predicament. In Adam’s mind, if there had been no woman there would have been no sin, so it’s not his fault. Similarly, Eve refuses to own what she has done and attempts to shift blame to the Serpent. Of course, God sees right through their games and would have none of this. He then has to set the record straight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are true to scripture, which should ALWAYS be our goal, the biblical text supports virtually none of these assertions made by modern commentators. I’m not saying the application of taking accountability is not valid. 1 John 1 8-9 are words to live by for disciples of Jesus &amp;lt;read&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m only saying the Bible is silent with respect to this question of whether or not Adam and Eve “passed the buck”. The traditional protestant interpretation puts words in God’s mouth and we need to be very cautious about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you notice, God doesn’t challenge Adam’s assertion. On the surface, it is a factual statement, including the part about the “woman You gave me.” He doesn’t challenge Eve’s assertion either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, we read into the biblical text how WE would respond if we were in the same situation. Then we assume that’s how the characters in the narrative must also have responded. Parents are all too familiar with the “blame games” played by their kids. This is a source of constant frustration for parents; therefore, we presume God must have felt exasperated just as way we do when our kids play the blame game. So a theology is born about how Adam skirted his responsibility and blamed someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now of course, on a deeper application level, we need to own our sin and not blame someone else or blame God (or even blame the enemy) for what we did. “The devil made me do it” is a cop out. The devil may have showed you something appealing, but you are the one who “did it.” (whatever “it” happens to be). Eve’s response is actually quite good here. I was lied to, but ultimately I’m the one who ate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also often taught that Adam was not where he should have been, which was protecting his wife. While this is also not an incorrect application for us, let’s be clear we are reading that into the text. The text doesn’t say where Adam was and it doesn’t chastise him for not being where He was supposed to be. We are adding that in. Again, I’m not saying that is necessarily an incorrect assumption; but it is an assumption nonetheless. We need to be careful when we assume as the saying goes. For all we know, Adam in his still unfallen state, was walking with God at the time, which means he was exactly where he should have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;The LORD God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field; on your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life. I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1 John 3:8&lt;/sup&gt; Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Gal 4:4&lt;/sup&gt; But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rom 16:20&lt;/sup&gt; The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rev 12:13&lt;/sup&gt; And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Luke 10:19&lt;/sup&gt; Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall hurt you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s declaration of war on Satan. This is a messianic prophecy and even hints of the Virgin birth. Biologically, the “seed” is always in the male.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler calls this the “seed plot of the Bible.” From here until Jesus, the messianic line will be under constant attack starting with Cain and Abel (actually it started with Adam and Eve) and continuing to the Cross and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;To the woman he said, “I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children. Your desire shall be contrary to your husband, but he shall rule over you.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;John 16:20&lt;/sup&gt; Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Romans 8:21-22&lt;/sup&gt; that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. &lt;sup&gt;22 &lt;/sup&gt;For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original intent was for Man and woman to be helpers and partners. Like officers in a company where the members have different roles but both answer to the head, which is God in this case. After the fall the relationship strained, and we certainly see the fruits of this in our society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God frequently uses the model of childbirth to describe the present, sinful age. There will be birth pains and travail as with labor, but then just as when the child is born, in the age to come all of that will give way to joy.&lt;/p&gt;

By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rev 22:3&lt;/sup&gt; No longer will there be anything accursed, but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rev 21:4&lt;/sup&gt; He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1 Cor 15:21, 47&lt;/sup&gt; For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 3:20&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The man called his wife&amp;rsquo;s name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 3:21&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins and clothed them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mat 25:36, 38, 40&lt;/sup&gt; I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.’ … And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? … And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always look for what seems like it should be said but isn’t. On a surface level, God apparently slaughtered an animal, but that’s not what it says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish sacrificial system sounds so antiquated and foreign to those of us who purchase our meat neatly prepared and wrapped in cellophane, but it has its roots right here. This is a hint that blood is required for sin. Without the shedding of blood, there can be no remission of sins. An innocent must die. It’s all here and it’s all because of sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking in His Dust – a very practical way to love our neighbor is modeled by God in verse 21 and also by Jesus in Matthew 21. We are obligated to provide clothes for the needy.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Just as God clothed the naked Adam and Eve. And if God made them, we can be sure this was the finest leather, not cheap polyester! Thus, there is also the secondary lesson that we should attempt to have the clothing we give away be of the finest quality; however, it is better to attempt to give old clothes to a needy person before we throw them in the trash. A poor person would prefer used clothes to none at all. As with the LYN reference above, we should take great care not to embarrass the recipient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Pliskin draws a second lesson from the same passage, “we must be aware of the greatness of lovingkindness.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He then draws an interesting contrast between lovingkindness and charity. “The sages taught that loving-kindness in all its forms is greater than charity.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He then gives some examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Charity is performed only with money, whereas lovingkindness can be performed both bodily and monetarily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As it is written, “God MADE them coats of skin”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Charity applies only to the poor, whereas lovingkindness applies to everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For it is written “He made for ADAM coats of skin”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam had all the riches of the world at his disposal including the ability to slay his own animal and make his own coat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, God chose to bless him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several instances in the gospels where Jesus will appear to violate the Jewish law, but when we peel back the layers, we see what he is really doing is performing an act of loving kindness when such an act takes priority over the law. I’ve given the example before of how it’s ok to travel at twice the posted speed limit, provided you have lights, sirens, and the word “ambulance” written on your vehicle. The first-responders are performing an act of lovingkindness and trying to save a life, which is more important than the policy dictating how fast one may drive under normal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever—”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see God as a cosmic killjoy who is only interested in taking your pleasure? Adam and Eve could have seen it that way. It might be easy to read and think “why doesn’t God want them to live forever?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col style=&#34;width: 50%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&#34;width: 50%&#34; /&gt;

&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 3:24&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rev 22:2&lt;/sup&gt; through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Joh 7:38&lt;/sup&gt; Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, ‘Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to look at this. Both are probably fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had eternal life symbolized by the tree of life but lost it when they sinned – therefore the cherub blocking the way is a punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had not yet eaten of the tree of life (which is implied by verse 22), which is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they had eaten, they would essentially have been condemned to live for all eternity in their fallen state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God doesn’t want them to eat and live permanently, eternally in their fallen state, thus the cherub blocking the way back is an act of mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, this is the first and quite possibly the most significant act of mercy recorded in the Bible prior to the Cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gravitate towards the second view. Being eternally unredeemed and unredeemable is Satan’s status. It makes sense that he wants nothing more than to entice as many humans as he can to join him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exile from the Garden also foreshadows Israel’s exile from Israel on two occasions and looks forward to the regathering in the Messianic kingdom, which will usher in the new Eden (Revelation 19-22). Jesus is “the way” (and the truth and the life) back to the restored Eden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition is very interesting at this point. One source records that Adam and Eve repented of their sin and baptized themselves in one of the rivers that flowed out of the garden (Gen 2:10). This is mind blowing as “all four Gospels open with John the Immerser calling Israel to repentance and confession of sin, symbolized through immersion in a river.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Christian tradition we generally have only one immersion but this is not the case in Judaism. Today, as it was in the time of Jesus, Jews underwent ritual cleansing in what is called a Mikveh. We aren’t told, but it is probably that Jesus underwent several ritual immersions in addition to the main baptism in the Jordan by John. Lancaster writes, “when a person immerses in the waters of the Mikvah, he is also re-establishing a link with man’s perfected state in Eden. He then loses the status of uncleanness, and is reborn into a state of purity, where he is permitted to enter the Holy Temple.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; That sounds very similar to how Christians view baptism. Lancaster concludes, “the cure for Adam’s sin can only be obtained by an immersion of repentence in to the death and resurrection of Messiah – the Living Water that flows from the River of Life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read/hear the portions&lt;/strong&gt;:
Genesis 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;
God instructs Noah—the 10th from Adam and the only righteous man in a world consumed by violence and corruption—to build a large wooden ark, coated within and without with pitch. God decrees that a great deluge will wipe out all life from the face of the earth; but the ark will float upon the water, sheltering Noah and his family, and two members (male and female) of each animal species (and 7 of the &amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo; species).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;When man began to multiply on the face of the land and daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw that the daughters of man were attractive. And they took as their wives any they chose.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2 Peter 2:4 For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word for “hell” in 2 Peter 2:4 is “&lt;em&gt;Tartarus&lt;/em&gt;”, it is the only time the word is used in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Then the LORD said, “My Spirit shall not abide in man forever, for he is flesh: his days shall be 120 years.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Galatians 5:14-17 For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another. But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Num 13:33 And there we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim), and we seemed to ourselves like grasshoppers, and so we seemed to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jude 6 And the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 17:27 They were eating and drinking and marrying and being given in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plain reading of the first four verses indicates that angelic beings, “sons of God,” descended to earth and had relations with human women, creating a half-breed race called the Nephilim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, this is bizarre to conceptualize and awkward to discuss in polite company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, several alternate theories have arisen in order to have the text mean anything other than what it actually says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter, Jude, and likely all of the apostles, followed the plain text reading, which is also recorded in the book of 1 Enoch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nephilim means the fallen ones, as in fallen angels. Heiser covers this topic extensively in his book “The Unseen Realm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numbers 13:33 indicates the Nephilim were giants and Jewish tradition says they committed all types of violence and sexual abominations and even became cannibals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Greek the term is gigantes, which makes us think of “giants” but the root word is actually &lt;em&gt;gigas&lt;/em&gt;, which means “earth-born.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the Nephilim were on the earth “After that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 14, 15 Rephaim&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numbers 13:33 Anakin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deut 3:11 Og, King of Bashan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Samuel 17 Goliath (and his four brothers) the Philistine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, Bashan is the Golan Heights at the foot of Mt. Hermon and Philistia was roughly where the Gaza Strip is today. These are two areas where Joshua failed to exterminate the inhabitants. (Joshua 15:14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might make more sense why God gave the otherwise disturbing order to Joshua to wipe out every man, woman and child in Cannan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;td&gt;The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And the LORD regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. So the LORD said, “I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rom 3:23-24 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rom 7:18-19 For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt 24:37-39 For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages teach that Cain spread his evil throughout the earth infecting his children and everyone else with his wickedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to guard the company we keep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we associate with righteous people, we will likely be righteous ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we associate with wicked people, we will likely become corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing has changed with the thoughts of our hearts. If we are given the opportunity to sin, the odds are high that we will. (Romans 3:23, 7:18-19).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That God was sorry He made man is quite a statement. Our sin grieves Him in ways we can’t imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Him to leave humanity unpunished would have been a miscarriage of justice, like when a jury acquits a murderer based on something other than the facts of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD. These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation. Noah walked with God. And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 Peter 2:5 if he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a herald of righteousness, with seven others, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lam 1:16 “For these things I weep; my eyes flow with tears; for a comforter is far from me, one to revive my spirit; my children are desolate, for the enemy has prevailed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Jn 2:1 My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an &lt;strong&gt;advocate&lt;/strong&gt; with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah was the lone exception to the wickedness around him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were indeed difficult times to remain blameless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah means comfort, comforter, or rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His parents said, “This one will give us rest from our work and from the toil of our hands.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, they expected Noah to be the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Lamentations 1:16, the “Comforter” becomes a title of the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1 John 2:1, the Greek word translated as “advocate” is &lt;em&gt;paraclete&lt;/em&gt;, which can also mean “comforter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Righteous and blameless do not mean sinless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul (Romans 3:23) and John (1 John 1:8) teach that no one is sinless other than Jesus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word for blameless denotes an animal that is acceptable for a sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They mean he had a heart to seek God and he lived his life in accordance with God’s standards of morality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah was a man of integrity; he was doing his job as an Image-bearer of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can read 2 Peter 2:5 as “a preacher of righteousness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By modern standards, Noah was the least successful preacher ever. Not a single person repented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether anyone is listening or not, godly people should stick out from the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you and I sticking out in a good way, or are we blending in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the “walking with God” phrase again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our discipleship journey is this kind of walk, path, road, or way. Hence our name Talmidim Way: the goal is for us to Walk with God along the way of disciples following after Yeshua, our great teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster writes, “Walking with God means keeping His commandments, but it also means enjoying His company.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three verses in the Torah that give us more clarity on walking with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteronomy 8:6 - So you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God by walking in his ways and by fearing him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteronomy 10:12 - “And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteronomy 11:22 - For if you will be careful to do all this commandment that I command you to do, loving the LORD your God, walking in all his ways, and holding fast to him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As talmidim, let’s glue ourselves to Yeshua and enjoy the walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col style=&#34;width: 50%&#34; /&gt;

&lt;th&gt;Genesis 6:11-13&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Now the earth was corrupt in God&#39;s sight, and the earth was filled with violence. And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth. And God said to Noah, “I have determined to make an end of all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them with the earth.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luke 17:26 Just as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rom 6:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eze 33:11 Say to them, As I live, declares the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live; turn back, turn back from your evil ways, for why will you die, O house of Israel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word for violence here is “Hamas;” yes, as in the terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its mildest form, it can mean “unjust gain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rabbis build on this to say that stealing of any amount is equivalent to physical violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one were to steal only a few dollars, who is to say that the victim might not have invested that sum enough to leave an inheritance for his children’s children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus Pliskin says, “We are forbidden to steal even small amounts.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If it’s not yours, don’t take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes not only physical items but with our tongues, we can also steal another’s reputation or another’s joy. Some kill by launching rockets at civilians; others kill with the tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us not do these works of Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God took no pleasure in what He was about to do. (Eze 33:11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the flood is a story of mercy. He didn’t wipe out the universe and start over; He took that which was broken and fixed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gets us to the Jewish concept of Tikkun Olam. That is Hebrew for fixing the (broken) world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the modern sense, the term is often appropriated by left-leaning organizations; but in a Biblical sense, that is exactly what God is doing here and it’s exactly what Jesus did throughout His earthly ministry, including His death on the Cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tikkun Olam means restoring the world back to God’s original intent, culminating with the New Eden/New Jerusalem in Revelation 21-22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Make yourself an ark of gopher wood. Make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch. This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark 300 cubits, its breadth 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits. Make a roof for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above, and set the door of the ark in its side. Make it with lower, second, and third decks.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 Peter 3:18-20 For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, because they formerly did not obey, when God&#39;s patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Pe 2:9 then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rabbis ask, “why did God trouble Noah to build an ark? He could have saved Noah in many other ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rashi answers that “the project was designed to arouse curiosity. For 120 years, people would be prompted to ask him, ‘Why is this necessary?’ Noah would then reply, ‘The Holy One, blessed be he, is about to bring a flood upon the world.’ Perhaps then they would repent.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“God held off judgment for 120 years in order to give people and opportunity to repent.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pliskin continues, “From here, we learn a practical lesson about admonition. For an admonition to be successful, we must find ways to arouse the listener’s interest.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter makes a wild statement here in 1 Pet 3:18-20 – he says it casually as if his original readers knew exactly what he was referencing. Apparently, Jesus after His death but before His resurrection visited the fallen angels of Genesis 6:1-3 and proclaimed His triumph over them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah will model the salvation of the world that God eventually brings through Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster: “Those within Messiah’s salvation (symbolized by the ark), though few in number, will pass through the cleansing waters of judgment and enter the kingdom, just as Noah and his family survived the flood and repopulated the earth.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big difference is that Noah saved only himself and his family, while Messiah brings salvation to the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish Talmud speculates on this topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“If the Holy One, blessed be He, did miracles for Noah who was righteous but not completely righteous…how much more so if he had been a perfectly righteous man!”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word translated as “roof” in the ESV is a difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could mean a window, in the sense of a skylight, but one sage believed it referred to a precious stone that would illuminate and provide light for the entire vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this respect, the light can be compared to the menorah in the temple, the only source of light that symbolizes the light of Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimensions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cubit is nominally 18” but could be as much as 25”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Missler, a 25” cubit would result in 4.1 MILLION cubic feet, the equivalent of 1400 railroad cars, enough to hold 340,000 sheep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a 25” cubit, the Ark could have been 625 feet long, 104 feet wide and 63 feet high, giving it a displacement of 65000 tons (the Titanic displaced 46,00 tons).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ark replica in Kentucky is a bit more conservative, using a 20.4” cubit for 510 feet long, 85 feet wide and 51 feet high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad joke: Q: what does a ship weigh? A: It’s anchor. (Volume is measured in displacement, not weight).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;td&gt;For behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life under heaven. Everything that is on the earth shall die. But I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons&#39; wives with you.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mat 24:39-41 and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. [40] Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heb 11:7 By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household. By this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just as the people did in Noah’s day, the generation of the Master’s return will ignore the warnings.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A popular end-times fiction series from the late 90s was called “Left Behind.” It imagined the world under the reign of the antichrist after all of the good Christians have been taken up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More often in the bible, it is the opposite. It is not the good who are taken. The evil are taken in judgment while the good are left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Flood, righteous Noah and his family are the ones “left behind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Genesis 6:19-22&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;References&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female. Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground, according to its kind, two of every sort shall come in to you to keep them alive. Also take with you every sort of food that is eaten, and store it up. It shall serve as food for you and for them.” Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isa 11:1,6 There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit… The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat, and the calf and the lion and the fattened calf together; and a little child shall lead them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most know the story of Noah’s Ark even if they are not Christian or Jewish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all of the ancient civilizations tell of a time long ago when the gods got so angry, they flood the earth to wipe out humanity except for a man and a woman who are left to repopulate the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our children’s stories, we often picture a boat overflowing with animals and the giraffe is always sticking his head out of the roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Flood is not a harmless children’s story – life was brought to the point of near extinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will see a footnote later that there are seven of every clean animal, which begs the question, “how did Noah know which animals were clean?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That all of the animals were made to live peaceably, including we presume natural predators of other animals, speaks of the shalom of the messianic age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A traditional Jewish Rabbi said of that era: “There will be neither famine nor war, neither envy nor competition, for good things will flow in abundance.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wicked versus the righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro 15:8-10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sacrifice of the wicked (Cain) is an abomination to the LORD,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but the prayer of the upright (Noah) is acceptable to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way of the wicked (Cain) is an abomination to the LORD,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but he loves him (Noah) who pursues righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is severe discipline for him (Cain) who forsakes the way;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;whoever hates reproof will die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read/hear the portions&lt;/strong&gt;:
Genesis 7:1-24&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/azTcRVrdm4c&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-71&#34;&gt;Gen 7:1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD said to Noah, “Go into the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that you are righteous before me in this generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heb 11:7 By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household. By this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 11:28 Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest (Heb. &lt;em&gt;noach&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew command “bo” can mean either come or go. “Come into the ark” seems to fit the mood of God’s providing shelter and security through this significant trial upon the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we noted last lesson, God could have elected to wipe everything out and start over. Instead, He chose to fix it. Tikkun Olam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice demands not only that the wicked be punished, but the innocent/righteous not be punished along with the wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, only Noah is described as righteous, not his wife or sons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They, presumably, were given a choice to follow Noah or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus a model for us is just as Noah’s family was saved on the basis of Noah’s righteousness, not their own, so too, if we follow Jesus, we are saved on the basis of His righteousness, not our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By virtue of being associated with Him and His righteousness, we are spared from the final judgment.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can take this a step further. Does today’s world scoff at the Bible’s description of the second-coming of Jesus who brings an end-times judgment? Did the larger world scoff at Noah when he was building the ark?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Pe 3:3-6 knowing this first of all, that scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing, following their own sinful desires. [4] They will say, “Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation.” [5] For they deliberately overlook this fact, that the heavens existed long ago, and the earth was formed out of water and through water by the word of God, [6] and that by means of these the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 24:39 “…until the flood came and took them all away. So will the coming of the Son of Man be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible uses flood imagery to describe the Tribulation period:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan 9:26 And the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end shall come with a flood, and to the end there shall be war. Desolations are decreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 12:15 The serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, to sweep her away with a flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-72-3&#34;&gt;Gen 7:2-3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2] Take with you seven pairs of all clean animals, the male and his mate, and a pair of the animals that are not clean, the male and his mate, [3] and seven pairs of the birds of the heavens also, male and female, to keep their offspring alive on the face of all the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional clean animals are needed for sacrifices after the flood.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an important insight. The Bible doesn’t provide every detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Text, clean and unclean designations do not occur until MUCH later (Lev 11:2-23).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, “somehow” Noah knows which are clean vs unclean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either God explained it to Noah directly, or perhaps He explained it to Adam, who passed it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, many (perhaps most) of the commands given at Sinai were not new to Moses. We might say they were codified as opposed to given for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has not yet been permission given to eat meat (that won’t come until Gen 9:2, and even there, no distinction is made between clean and unclean animals), so the assumption is that clean animals were needed for sacrifice, not man’s diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-74-5&#34;&gt;Gen 7:4-5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4] For in seven days I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, and every living thing that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground.” [5] And Noah did all that the LORD had commanded him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems more likely that God sent the animals to Noah, versus Noah going out and fetching them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish Targum says, “Behold, I give you the space of seven days; if they will repent they will be forgiven, but if they still will not repent, seven days from now, I will cause rain to come down upon the earth forty days and forty nights.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Blot out” is a good choice for the verb in verse 4. Some translations say “destroy” but “blot out” captures the essence of the word. Sinful man is to be violently erased without a trace, buried beneath the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-76-9&#34;&gt;Gen 7:6-9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6] Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came upon the earth. [7] And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons&amp;rsquo; wives with him went into the ark to escape the waters of the flood. [8] Of clean animals, and of animals that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps on the ground, [9] two and two, male and female, went into the ark with Noah, as God had commanded Noah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who have done the math calculated that Noah turned 600 in the same year Methuselah died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this we learn that “Methuselah’s” name was a prophecy. Mot = death; u=pronominal suffix meaning “his”; shelach = send or bring (forth). Methuselah means “his death shall bring,” as in bring forth judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year Methuselah died, the flood of waters came on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fact, the Talmud says the reference to “seven days” in verse 4 corresponds to the required seven-day mourning period; i.e., the rain began seven days after Methuselah died.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methuselah was the longest living person at 969, which is a picture of God’s mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People had almost 1000 years to repent and 120 years to get on the boat. They did neither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s mercy and patience are not infinite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-710-12&#34;&gt;Gen 7:10-12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:4.29653in;height:3.22222in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[10] And after seven days the waters of the flood came upon the earth. [11] In the six hundredth year of Noah&amp;rsquo;s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened. [12] And rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, the word for sky and heavens are the same – shamayim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A partial list of 40s in the Bible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flood waters (Gen 7:4, 12, 17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses on Mt. Sinai (Exodus 24:18) &amp;amp; Moses’ fasted during this time, just like Jesus did (Ex 34:28)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twelve spies scout the promised land (Numbers 13:25); Joshua, one of the spies, was 40 at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentenced to wander in the wilderness specifically one year for every day the spies were in the land (Numbers 14:34; Heb 3:9); also were provided manna and provision for forty years (Ex 16:35; Deu 8:4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;40-year periods of either rest or subjugation occur throughout Judges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goliath mocked Israel 40 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezekiel lay on his right side to bear the iniquities Judah (Ezekiel 4:6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, Ezekiel was told to lay on his left side for 150 days according to the LXX rendering of Ezekiel 4:4-5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Genesis 7:24 we’re told that after the 40 days of rain, the waters prevailed upon the earth for 150 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus fasted in the wilderness 40 days/nights being tempted by the devil (Mark 1:13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two general themes emerge from this list: trials/judgment/testing and God’s provision&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are occurring in the Flood narrative&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of models have been suggested:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ark is a type of Jesus. Just as those in the ark were saved, those who are in Jesus are preserved and provided for during the time of God’s judgment upon the earth; those not in Christ perish (1 Peter 3:21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who hold a pre-trib rapture see it slightly differently: Enoch represents a group of people who will be &lt;strong&gt;removed prior&lt;/strong&gt; to God’s wrath (said to be the raptured church), Noah and the Ark represents a group of people who will be &lt;strong&gt;preserved through&lt;/strong&gt; God’s wrath (said to be National Israel and believing “tribulation saints (perhaps those are one and the same)), and everyone else is the group of people who will &lt;strong&gt;perish&lt;/strong&gt; as a result of God’s wrath (said to be unbelievers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that Noah is “sealed” by God (i.e. sealed inside the ark) in verse 16, just like the saints are sealed by God during the tribulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enoch was “pre-flood,” not “mid-flood” or “post-flood.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fountains of the deep burst forth”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be easy to miss but the cause of the flooding was not exclusively due to the rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This recalls Genesis 1:6-7 and “the waters above” compared to “the waters below”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could refer to massive earthquakes resulting in the breakup and shift of continents, releasing subterranean waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have no idea what the earth was like before the flood, but we can surmise that it looked nothing like it does today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per the Bible Knowledge Commentary, “No doubt the surface of the earth, the manner of life, and the longevity of life were changed by this catastrophe.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler lists a number of “geological mysteries” that he speculates could have only been caused by the Flood:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grand Canyon, mid-oceanic mountain ranges, coal and oil formations, frozen mammoths in Siberia, fossil graveyards, and the apparent “jigsaw” fit of continents (for example South America and Africa) which are probably the result of horizontal compression/buckling.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-713-15&#34;&gt;Gen 7:13-15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[13] On the very same day Noah and his sons, Shem and Ham and Japheth, and Noah&amp;rsquo;s wife and the three wives of his sons with them entered the ark, [14] they and every beast, according to its kind, and all the livestock according to their kinds, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, according to its kind, and every bird, according to its kind, every winged creature. [15] They went into the ark with Noah, two and two of all flesh in which there was the breath of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.59306in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah’s sons are named but his wife never is named.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every mention during the flood narrative, Noah’s sons are always mentioned before his wife (6:18, 7:7, 7:13). After the flood, this changes (Gen 8:18).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also the three sons were living for 100 years before the flood. This would have been ample time to have children and grandchildren of their own yet there is no mention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either they didn’t have children or they did, but they declined to enter into the Ark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the latter option is true, it’s a reminder that no matter how closely you walk with God, your kids have free will and must make their own decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-716-17&#34;&gt;Gen 7:16-17&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[16] And those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him. And the LORD shut him in. [17] The flood continued forty days on the earth. The waters increased and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note Who closes the door. Why does the Spirit tell us this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah found divine protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joh 17:12 While I was with them, I kept them in your name, which you have given me. I have guarded them, and not one of them has been lost except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both Matthew 3 and Luke 3, John the Baptist, who baptized with water, said Jesus baptizes with the Holy Spirit and with Fire (Matthew 3:11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism with the Holy Spirit is the blessing for righteous believers in Yeshua,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism with Fire is the judgment of the wicked unbelievers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is eventually a deadline for making this decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while the door is open and anyone could have joined Noah’s family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.32153in&#34; /&gt;At some point, God will close the door and people will have made their choices as to which side of the fence to be on for eternity: Spirit or Fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This door application is not as much of a stretch as it might seem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following verses and Who said them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 3:8 “‘I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut. I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 3:20 Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mat 25:10 And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luk 11:7 and he will answer from within, ‘Do not bother me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luk 12:36 and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the wedding feast, so that they may open the door to him at once when he comes and knocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luk 13:24-25 “Strive to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able. When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, ‘Lord, open to us,’ then he will answer you, ‘I do not know where you come from.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joh 10:1-2 “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber. But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joh 10:7,9 So Jesus again said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for good measure, consider this description of Peter’s location immediately before he denied Jesus: Joh 18:16 but Peter stood outside at the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler: “The debate about alternative theological speculations ended when the door was shut.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if we want to talk about the fate vs free will discussion, here we see that God provides the door and God does the sealing but Noah had to respond in obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I see support for the Lutheran response to Calvin and Arminius:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are redeemed can only do so if they are called and sealed by God; no matter how righteous Noah was, he couldn’t save or seal himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are not redeemed have only themselves to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-718-20&#34;&gt;Gen 7:18-20&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.18579in;height:3.83519in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[18] The waters prevailed and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the face of the waters. [19] And the waters prevailed so mightily on the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered. [20] The waters prevailed above the mountains, covering them fifteen cubits deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Bible doesn’t generally claim to be a science or history textbook with every last detail, here the Divine Narrator is absolutely asserting a worldwide flood, not a local one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And the waters prevailed” is mentioned four times for emphasis (18, 19, 20, and 24).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the New International Commentary on the Old Testament, see “a poetic substratum underlying the Genesis narrative.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of the savagery of the storm and in the absence of navigational personnel or equipment (apparently not even a rudder), “the ark neither sinks nor capsizes.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-721-23&#34;&gt;Gen 7:21-23&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[21] And all flesh died that moved on the earth, birds, livestock, beasts, all swarming creatures that swarm on the earth, and all mankind. [22] Everything on the dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died. [23] He blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens. They were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word for breath is ruach, which is the same word for Spirit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only Breath/Spirit was with those inside the Ark; there was no Spirit outside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the poetic/artistic description of the destruction of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factually 23b is all we needed to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only Noah and those with him in the ark survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being an “instruction manual” for life, the Bible is to be savored and enjoyed as a masterpiece of literature that tugs at our emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only marine life and anything inside the ark survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to caveat that only marine life that wasn’t smashed into today’s fossils by the massive change in water pressure survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fossils of marine life (fish and sea shells) at high elevations, often in inland locations are another example of a worldwide flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Land animals have also been found fossilized in locations below sea level.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We presume dinosaurs and mammoths weren’t on the invite list and quickly drowned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler asks rhetorically how come there are no “new fossils” being discovered today?&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus says “as it was in the days of Noah” so it shall be at the end of this age (Mat 24:37-39).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-724&#34;&gt;Gen 7:24&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[24] And the waters prevailed on the earth for 150 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This narrative style is not like anything we are used to outside of the Bible (and it makes doing a verse-by-verse commentary a bit of a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost like sea swells, Verses 1-5 talk about entry into the ark, verse 6 talks about the flood outside the ark; verses 7-9 return to talking about entry into the ark, verses 10-12 go back to the flood happening outside, verses 13-16 we’re back inside the ark; verses 17-23a were outside; verse 23b we’re inside and verse 24 we’re outside again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This style is common with ancient epics and is called “resumption and summation”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read/hear the portions&lt;/strong&gt;:
Genesis 8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rain falls for 40 days and nights, and the waters churn for 150 days more before calming and beginning to recede. Then the ark settles on Mount Ararat, and Noah dispatches a raven, and then a series of doves, “to see if the waters were abated from the face of the earth.” When the ground dries completely God commands Noah to exit the ark and repopulate the earth. Noah builds an altar and offers sacrifices to God. God swears never again to destroy all of mankind because of their deeds.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vz2O_AkHoXA&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genesis 8 is a straightforward narrative that is largely absent of any significant tension or drama. It provides a bit of a respite between the physical and emotional trauma of the Flood in chapters 6-7 and the familial mischief we will see in chapter 9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-81&#34;&gt;Genesis 8:1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the livestock that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God did not forget about the guy on the barge with the floating zoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, saying “God remembered” is shorthand for “God remembered his promise/covenant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 19:29 – God remembered Abraham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 30:22 – God remembered Rachael, and God listened to her and opened her womb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exodus 3:24 - And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exodus 6:5 Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the people of Israel whom the Egyptians hold as slaves, and I have remembered my covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here God institutes the evaporative water-cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word for wind and spirit are the same: &lt;em&gt;ruach&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As wind does not directly cause water to subside, a deeper meaning might be that God sent the Holy Spirit to bring order and institute what we might call the laws of nature upon the newly redesigned planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to remember the context:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wind and ocean currents would have been entirely new experiences for Noah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He would soon find himself atop a 17,000’ mountain when before, we presume his environment was more tropical. (think altitude sickness and freezing temperatures/ice).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there was lingering seismic activity as the intense weight of water is removed from 1/3 of the earth’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure he was a bit unsettled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-82-4&#34;&gt;Genesis 8:2-4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained, and the waters receded from the earth continually. At the end of 150 days, the waters had abated, and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day of the seventh month, would be 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of Nisan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passover is always at sundown on the 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;/15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of Nisan (“between the evenings”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In AD 32, the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day of the month would have been a Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus was crucified on the 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, in the grave for three days, and resurrected on the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler, who supports an AD 32 crucifixion, suggests, “Noah’s ‘new beginning’ on the Plant Earth was on the anniversary – in anticipation – of our ‘new beginning in Christ!”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:100%&#34; /&gt;Ararat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must note that sometimes the name comes after the tradition and not before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text says the Ark came to rest in “the mountains of Ararat,” which would indicate that Ararat was a range, not a single peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, someone comes along and says, “yeah, it happened right here,” and a tradition is born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see the same with Mount Moriah in Genesis 22. There is nothing in the text that says Abraham went to Jerusalem; but later tradition places the event there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say the tradition is wrong; however. We just admit that we aren’t told from the text the precise location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern Mount Ararat (as in a single peak) is in the Lake Van region of eastern Turkey, near the border with Armenia and Iran.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17000’ in elevation and is difficult to get to because of the surrounding plains and ridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This location is attested several times in antiquity, including by Josephus, but the Gilgamesh flood epic has that ark coming to rest in southern Kurdistan.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several expeditions have been attempted with some claiming to find fragments of the ark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Divine Narrator made it a point to tell us that the Ark was pitched on the inside as well as the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally one only need pitch the outside of a wooden boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pitching both sides suggests a need for preservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-85-9&#34;&gt;Genesis 8:5-9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen. At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made and sent forth a raven. It went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth. Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground. But the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her and brought her into the ark with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A raven, as a scavenger, is an unclean bird while a dove, as an herbivore, is in the clean category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raven had plenty of dead stuff to eat so it didn’t need to return to the ark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dove, which has a much shorter and lower flight path, had no option but to return when there was no plant life in close proximity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in our day, a raven has sinister connotations (thanks in large part to Edgar Allen Poe), but throughout the Bible, birds of prey (which are all unclean) seem to represent ministers of Satan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the covenant ceremony between God and Abram, the Narrator adds this little tidbit: “And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away” (Gen 15:11). The suggestion is that Satan is attempting to interfere with the covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Parable of the Sower, Jesus describes the first type of seed: “And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them” (Mat 13:4). He then elaborates, “When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path” (Mat 13:19).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Noah thought “no great loss” if raven #1 never returned to raven #2 to multiply the species. Perhaps mentioning that “it went to and fro until the waters dried” is a way of saying it was still around when Noah released the other animals; therefore, the species was allowed to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must be fair to the poor raven though. In 1 Kings 17, ravens actually minister to Elijah: “And the ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the brook” (1Ki 17:6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We appear to have symmetry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;40 days/nights rain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;150 days waters increase&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;150 days waters abated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;40 days waters subsided&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking In His Dust&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we have sent someone on a mission, we should treat him kindly even if he is unsuccessful.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eph 4:32 Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason that makes studying the Jewish commentaries fascinating is the sages ask questions about the Bible that would never occur to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here they note that the dove did not fly back into the ark but only returned to the vicinity of the ark. It did not reenter until Noah extended his hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? (and you have to think creatively like a sage):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“having returned without anything in her mouth she thought her master would not allow her to come back inside. However, Noah had compassion for the dove and took her in his hand to warm her while she rested from her journey.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application, though admittedly quite abstract with the case of Noah’s dove, is that people will let us down (and we will let others down) from time to time. Just as we would wish to be treated with compassion, so we should treat others with dignity and lift them up even when they fail us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a manager, I tried to live this out and a couple of times the offending staff member thanked me for the way we solved the problem. Unfortunately, I was less successful at doing this as a parent when my kids were little; but I’m attempting to live this out now. I guess the good news is that one of my boys, now in his 20s recently noticed the difference. He said, “wow. I thought you’d be really upset. You must be mellowing in your old age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loving your neighbor as yourself means extending mercy to others just as you would want mercy extended to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-810-12&#34;&gt;Genesis 8:10-12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He waited another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark. And the dove came back to him in the evening, and behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth. Then he waited another seven days and sent forth the dove, and she did not return to him anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good thing Noah had six more doves, or this might have been the end of the line for the dove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton suggests the olive leaf, in addition to being a symbol of peace and new life, provided Noah a clue as to the depth of the waters and how quickly they were receding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olive trees are notoriously resilient and tend to regenerate even if cut down.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olive branches and doves are universal symbols of peace. Olive branches are incorporated into the symbolism of the United States (juxtaposed against arrows of course – as if to say, “we desire peace, but don’t mess with us”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We remember that the spirit ascended upon Jesus “like a dove” (Matt 3:16), so there is a connection with the dove and the Holy Spirit. In Genesis 1 we were told that the spirit moved over the face of the waters, just as Noah’s dove does here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in verse 9, the dove found rest (noach in Hebrew means rest), just as the dove in Matthew 3 found rest in messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-813&#34;&gt;Genesis 8:13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried from off the earth. And Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be the day we know as Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year. Another new beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Rosh HaShana, the shofar (trumpet) is blown, “in anticipation of the coming of the Messiah and the resurrection of the dead.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In other words, this is a deliberate reference to the Messianic Era we studied in Revelation. Lancaster continues, “After the judgment has abated and the trumpet of the Messiah sounds, Jesus will usher in a new era and a new world.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-814-17&#34;&gt;Genesis 8:14-17&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth had dried out. Then God said to Noah, “Go out from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons&amp;rsquo; wives with you. Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh—birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth—that they may swarm on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the flood, the sons were listed before his wife; after the flood, we have Noah’s wife listed (but still never named).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m not sure what the significance of this is but whenever a pattern changes, we want to take note.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God will speak directly to Noah here and again in chapter 9. He won’t speak directly to a man again until Abram, ten generations and hundreds of years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as God called Noah to enter the ark, Noah patiently waits for God to call him out of the ark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is NOT what I would have done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to have God initiate a project and point me in the right direction; but then I’m quick to say, “Thanks, God. I’ll take it from here. I’ll let you know if I need help.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to be more like Noah and let God direct each step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-818-19&#34;&gt;Genesis 8:18-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons&amp;rsquo; wives with him. Every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out by families from the ark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are reminded that “Noah did all that the LORD had commanded him” (Gen 7:5).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-820&#34;&gt;Genesis 8:20&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Noah built an altar to the LORD and took some of every clean animal and some of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t have it recorded that God instructed Noah to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps God did instruct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Noah had the heart of a worshipper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike sin offerings or peace offerings, burnt offerings are usually associated with petitions or dedications before God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a burnt offering, the fire on the altar completely consumes the entire sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It represents a total surrender of the sacrifice to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-Jews only offer burnt offerings; gentiles (of which Noah is one) never offer sin or peace offerings.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-821-22&#34;&gt;Genesis 8:21-22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when the LORD smelled the pleasing aroma, the LORD said in his heart, “I will never again curse the ground because of man, for the intention of man&amp;rsquo;s heart is evil from his youth. Neither will I ever again strike down every living creature as I have done. While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Php 4:18 I have received full payment, and more. I am well supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Act 14:16-17 In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways. [17] Yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good by giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take the seasons for granted, but it was all new for Noah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Talmud delineates the six seasons listed in Genesis 8:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seed-time: October-November&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cold: December-January&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winter: February-March&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvest: April-May&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer: June-July&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heat: August-September&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the Flood didn’t fix man’s heart. In Hebrew, raq rah qol hayom. Only evil all the time. We are still a long way from the “It was very good” in Genesis 1:31.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While the earth remains” is an important clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jeremiah 32:25 God says He will honor His covenant with the Jewish people and His covenant with the house of David so long as the earth remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s patience with man’s evil will not last indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another reason why it’s awesome to study genesis immediately &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; studying Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After studying the last four chapters of Revelation, we now can contextualize a statement such as “while the earth remains.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our depraved sinful nature will rear its ugly head in Genesis chapter 9, which we’ll look at next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Genesis 9 - Human government</title>
      <link>https://talmidimway.com/commentary/genesis/gen1/gen09/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://talmidimway.com/commentary/genesis/gen1/gen09/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read/hear the portions&lt;/strong&gt;: Genesis 9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary: God reiterates His promise to never again to destroy all of mankind because of their deeds and sets the rainbow as a testimony of His new covenant with man. God also commands Noah regarding the sacredness of life: murder is deemed a capital offense, and while man is permitted to eat the meat of animals, he is forbidden to eat flesh or blood taken from a living animal. Noah plants a vineyard and becomes drunk on its produce. Two of Noah’s sons, Shem and Japheth, are blessed for covering up their father’s nakedness, while his third son, Ham, is punished for taking advantage of his debasement.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who adhere to dispensational theology see the third of seven dispensations beginning with Genesis 9. At the beginning of creation was the age of “Innocence.” After the fall and through the flood was the age of “Conscience.” After the flood and up until the promise to Abraham is the age of “Human Government.” An example of this is the institution of the death penalty in Genesis 9:5-6.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, we’re going to spend the bulk of our time looking at something called the Seven Noachide Laws that the Jewish sages derive from Genesis 9 and how those laws relate to the prohibitions given by the Apostles to the Gentile believers in Acts 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-91-6-god-commissions-noah&#34;&gt;Gen 9:1-6 God Commissions Noah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God reiterates the command given in Eden. In fact, God says “be fruitful and multiply” twice in this passage (v. 1 and v.7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to see that instead of filling the whole earth, humanity is going to gather at Bavel/Babylon&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, inviting yet another judgment from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every bird of the heavens, upon everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea. Into your hand, they are delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God recommissions Noah with Dominion; these words echo when God said “it was very good” in Genesis 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;birds - Dominion of the Air&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beasts - Dominion over the Land&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish - Dominion over the Water&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 2:7-8 You made him for a little while lower than the angels; you have crowned him with glory and honor, putting everything in subjection under his feet.” Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. And as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Timothy 4:1-3 Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons, through the insincerity of liars whose consciences are seared, who forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Peter is not talking about those who say we shouldn’t eat pork and shellfish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In God’s terminology, the flesh of unclean animals is not unclean food. It’s not food at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, pork and lobster are not foods that God created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul, who remained an observant jew until the end would not be advocating eating things God said not to eat and that he would not have eaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to think a better modern application would be those who say we need to stop eating beef (something first permitted in Genesis 9:4) and this whole push to eat fake meat that is laced with who knows what chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 But you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 15:19-20 Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God but should write to them to abstain from the things polluted by idols, and from sexual immorality, and from what has been strangled, and from blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton: “The draining of the blood before eating the meat was a way of returning the life force of the animal to the God who gave it life… (This ceremony) offers recognition that they are partaking of God’s bounty as His guests,…not unlike that of the blessing said before a meal in modern practice.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll talk much more about Acts 15 in our addendum to this lesson on the Noachide laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 And for your lifeblood I will require a reckoning: from every beast I will require it and from man. From his fellow man, I will require a reckoning for the life of man.
6 “Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed, for God made man in his own image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 26:52 And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear. Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recall from our chapter 1 discussion, that “Image” is likely not any specific human attribute such as reason or intellect – a human can lose these things through disease or accident and still be in the Image of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s best to think of “Image” as a status given by God to man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crude paraphrase might be “if you mess with one of my image bearers, you mess with Me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This institutes the practice of the avenger of blood – typically the victim’s next of kin was tasked with seeing justice was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standards for capital trials will be developed in Numbers 35 and Deuteronomy 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people ask what good putting to death a murderer achieves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fair response is there is no good that comes out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The victim’s life is not restored and now a second life is forfeited. It is a tragedy all around and it should not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT this is God’s standard for achieving justice in the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard puts a would-be murderer on notice this he will be directly responsible for two deaths: his victim’s life and his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-97-16-the-rainbow-promise&#34;&gt;Gen 9:7-16 The Rainbow Promise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 And you, be fruitful and multiply, increase greatly on the earth and multiply in it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 “Behold, I establish my covenant with you and your offspring after you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God covenants to find a different way to deal with man’s sin.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the livestock, and every beast of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark; it is for every beast of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 I have set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh. And the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of a local flood have a problem because there have been many local floods that have resulted in the loss of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has never been another worldwide flood that destroyed all life though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isaiah 54:7-10 For a brief moment I deserted you, but with great compassion I will gather you. In overflowing anger for a moment, I hid my face from you, but with everlasting love I will have compassion on you,” says the LORD, your Redeemer. “This is like the days of Noah to me: as I swore that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you, and will not rebuke you. For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed, but my steadfast love shall not depart from you, and my covenant of peace shall not be removed,” says the LORD, who has compassion on you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ancient-covenants&#34;&gt;Ancient Covenants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to think of a covenant as a contract, which, in its simplest form it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a Biblical covenant is more like a Trust in that a covenant is always a promise made not only to the person, such as Noah or Abraham but to his heirs in perpetuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are all descendants of Noah; by virtue of verse 9, you and I are named in this trust covenant. That’s exciting!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covenants are Legally binding, like a contract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jos 9:19 But all the leaders said to all the congregation, “We have sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel, and now we may not touch them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we have a decision from the United States Supreme Court: United States vs. Throckmorton (1878) stated that “fraud vitiates the most solemn contracts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covenants are Intergenerational, like a trust&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exo 6:5 Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the people of Israel whom the Egyptians hold as slaves, and I have remembered my covenant (with Abraham)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covenants are usually conditional (both sides need to perform), but not always&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The covenants with Noah, Abraham and David are unilateral and unconditional – only God has to perform. There is nothing Noah, Abraham, or David could do to break the covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking a covenant has dire consequences&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A broken covenant requires atonement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of God’s covenants has a sign&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah-rainbow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham-circumcision&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses-the Sabbath&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David-House (Temple and Kingdom)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus/New-Holy Spirit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rainbow-as-a-sign-of-messiah&#34;&gt;Rainbow as a sign of Messiah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow teaches us about Messiah.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Token of peace between God and humanity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spans the distance between heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflects the radiance of the glory of God – Ezekiel 1:28 Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around. Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard the voice of one speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light from heaven interacts with moisture from the earth to produce a beautiful refraction and splendid display of divine glory. When the heavenly Word, the light of the world, interests an earthly man, it refracts into a beautiful demonstration of God’s glory on earth called Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a pun on the word bow, a sign of divine judgment. When we see the rainbow, we are worthy of the same fate as the flood generation, yet through a covenant of God, we are spared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-917-27-noahs-drunkenness&#34;&gt;Gen 9:17-27 Noah&amp;rsquo;s Drunkenness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17 God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.”
18 The sons of Noah who went forth from the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.)
19 These three were the sons of Noah, and from these, the people of the whole earth were dispersed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10 will give us the names of “these the people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, we almost expect the next verse after 9:19 to be Genesis 10:2 (as 10:1 is practically the same as 9:19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 Noah began to be a man of the soil, and he planted a vineyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Noah’s credit, chapter 8 tells us he built an altar and offered sacrifices first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that Noah rebuilt the same altar used by Adam after his banishment from the Garden and the same altar used by Cain and Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When Messiah comes, He will rebuild the holy Temple and reestablish the altar of the LORD. He will usher in an age during which vineyards will produce abundantly.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21 He drank the wine and became drunk and lay uncovered in his tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oldest known wine jar dates to the sixth millennium and was found in modern Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until now, Noah has been heroic in his righteousness. Like David, notice how the Bible is transparent regarding the shortcomings of otherwise great men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brothers outside.
23 Then Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it on both their shoulders, and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were turned backward, and they did not see their father&amp;rsquo;s nakedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even God’s righteous make mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are (at least) two mistakes happening here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah did something shameful in view of his children&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Noah’s children dishonored his father in some unwritten way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People will make mistakes but the godly thing to do is to look away from their foolishness and try to cover their shame (cover in a good way as in shield the foolishness from others, not in the sense of making excuses for it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Peter 4:8-9 Above all, keep loving one another earnestly since love covers a multitude of sins. Show hospitality to one another without grumbling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24 When Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his youngest son had done to him,
25 he said, “Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be to his brothers.”
26 He also said, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem; and let Canaan be his servant.
27 May God enlarge Japheth, and let him dwell in the tents of Shem, and let Canaan be his servant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have no idea what “uncovering his father’s nakedness means,” and it’s somewhat natural for our imaginations to run wild here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, the Bible is graphic in many places, so if even the BIBLE is not telling what it was it must have been really bad. Maybe or maybe not. We aren’t told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shouldn’t assume something “done” to Noah is physical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merely mocking Noah’s nakedness, especially if done by a son, would be doing harm to Noah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not honoring one’s father and mother is to do wrong to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern modesty vs immodesty&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a ridiculously hypersexualized world and we are exposed to things we wish we didn’t have to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the choice to be like Shem and Japheth who turn our backs and maintain boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expressions of intimacy are appropriate (and are only appropriate) between a husband and wife but this needs to be kept within the privacy of their own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also don’t know why Canaan is directly cursed instead of Ham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One speculation is the Canaanites were the people group the Israelites were most familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another view is that this is a prophecy of the wicked Canaanites, who will need to be expunged from the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other places in the Bible, “to uncover the nakedness of” a man means to have relations with the man’s wife. See Leviticus 18 and 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other time Nakedness and drunkenness are described in the same event is Genesis 19 with Lot and his daughters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One theory is Canaan was the offspring of an incestuous relationship, but this view is problematic.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, there is more going on than we are being told, but that’s how the Bible goes sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible tells us everything we need to know, not always everything we’d want to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blessing and cursing appear to come from Noah, not God. There is no “thus sayeth the LORD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of Shem and Japheth, Shem is given the larger blessing (specifically the LORD of Shem) – Lord Messiah will come through the line of Shem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:80%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note three distinct categories of people&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shem – Semites; primarily Jews and Arabs. Also Assyria, Persia, Arabia. It’s Shem’s tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japheth – (loosely) Europe, Turkey, Russia. Japheth will dwell in Shem’s tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ham – all of the “…ites” that are the traditional enemies of Israel. Ham will be in subjugation to Shem and Japheth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this, note the Messianic application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messiah and Messiah’s people are in the line of Shem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japheth represents those gentiles who will be joined to Messiah (dwell in the tents of Shem)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ham represents those who will be subjugated under Messiah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a personal application, all are welcome to be joined to Messiah (or to reject Him) regardless of bloodline, but from a national application, the geography of Ham appears to line up with the nations that lead the charge against the Lord and his anointed in the end of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-928-29-noah-dies-at-950&#34;&gt;Gen 9:28-29 Noah Dies at 950&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;28 After the flood Noah lived 350 years.
29 All the days of Noah were 950 years, and he died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we do the math, Noah lived almost until the time of Abraham and Seth WAS a contemporary of Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, Abraham could have talked with his great-great…grandfather Shem who was on the Ark. And Shem could have talked with his great-great grandfather Methuselah who knew Adam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah also witnessed his own offspring going bad at the Tower of Babel, which we will get to in the next lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-seven-noachide-laws-of-genesis-9-and-the-acts-15-council&#34;&gt;The Seven Noachide Laws of Genesis 9 and the Acts 15 Council&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although God instituted a new beginning, as we saw from chapter 8, nothing about man’s heart had changed. One reason this new period is called the “Age of government” is that we see God instituting some precise instructions. From Genesis 9:1-6, there are four overt commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be fruitful and multiply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not eat meat with lifeblood (or do not eat un-bled meat).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put murderers to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;three-classes-of-people&#34;&gt;Three classes of people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient Jewish sages read between the lines and determined seven general laws. In the sages’ opinion, these laws are self-evident and therefore binding on ALL humanity. As history unfolds, the Hebrews will later be held to an even higher standard. As we review this list, let’s keep in mind Jesus’ statements that He came to fulfill, not abolish, the Jewish Torah, as well as the four prohibitions given to the early gentile believers in Acts 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin our discussion, we need to recognize that there are three classes of people from the Torah’s perspective. We often think of only Jews and Gentiles, but to the Jewish person, there are two categories of gentiles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The b’nei Israel: natural-born Jews and legal gentile proselytes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required to keep full Torah&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ger toshav: Resident aliens/(righteous) gentiles who attached themselves to the God and people of Israel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required to keep Noachide and portions of the Torah&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goyim; the (unbelieving) gentile nations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Required to keep Noachide Laws&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that they largely did not, proves their wickedness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;composition-of-the-acts-15-church&#34;&gt;Composition of the Acts 15 church&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the early church went forth from the day of Pentecost in Acts 2, all of the early believers were Jewish and therefore approached faith in Messiah from this common Jewish perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the church grew, eventually Gentiles without any Jewish frame of reference started coming to the faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These gentiles fellowshipped alongside of their believing Jewish counterpart, they worshiped together and shared meals together. As Paul notes in Romans 10-11, the gentile believers are considered spiritual sons of Abraham, so no one was doubting they were “saved” as we think of the term, but practically we can see how this living side-by-side created a bit of a difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those advocating for full Jewishness, did so in part because they simply wanted to eliminate the tension that the gentile believers created by living so closely with their Jewish counterparts. This was a practical solution. However, the problem with this option is that it is not supported by the Torah, which clearly provides three classes of people. Jew, Ger toshav and goyim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, according to the torah, proselytization is voluntary. Although forced conversions have been done throughout history; God never sanctions this. So it would be inconsistent for the early church to have instituted forced conversions. It’s also unreasonable to expect an adult new convert to take on the full weight of the Torah, which is something that the natural-born Jews would have studied since their childhood. The other side of the same coin is that Moses allowed for a category of &lt;em&gt;ger toshav&lt;/em&gt; so it would have been inconsistent for the early church NOT to allow this category. Yet the early church fathers knew that there had to be some distinction between the &lt;em&gt;ger toshav&lt;/em&gt; that believed in Messiah and the goyim, the pagan Romans who did not. These are the questions before the Acts 15 council. Let’s look at how they responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;acts-1512-21&#34;&gt;Acts 15:12-21&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all the assembly fell silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles. After they finished speaking, James replied, “Brothers, listen to me. Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles, to take from them a people for his name. And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written, “‘After this I will return, and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen; I will rebuild its ruins, and I will restore it, that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles who are called by my name, says the Lord, who makes these things known from of old.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God, but should write to them &lt;strong&gt;to abstain from the things polluted by idols, and from sexual immorality, and from what has been strangled, and from blood&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;For from ancient generations Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him, for he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we try to understand the context of Acts 15, we’ll want to be asking a series of questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why only these four?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were and are these four the ONLY laws binding on gentile believers or were there others not mentioned that would have been understood?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did the Apostles view these four as the only laws that would ever be binding on Gentiles or was this a starting place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passage in acts ends with the statement about moses being proclaimed every week. Why does a statement on gentiles conclude with Jewish Moses being read every Jewish Sabbath in the Jewish synagogues?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers to these questions, I believe, lie in understanding the background of the Noachide laws. So let’s dig into those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-seven-noachide-laws&#34;&gt;The seven Noachide Laws&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: there is no official order of the seven laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not worship idols or other gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God spoke directly to Job, Noah, Adam, and others who were not Jews, (they were pre-Abraham who was the first Jew). Thus the sages viewed monotheism as self-evident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prohibits worshipping any created thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prohibits creating any object for the purpose of veneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prohibits occult arts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, “the Torah’s numerous laws that deal with idolatry pertain to Gentiles.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostles believed this was self-evident and not necessary to repeat in Acts 15. There is a problem with meat sacrificed to idols that we’ll get to later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not blaspheme God’s name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages took this from the story of Job, who was also not Jewish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job 2:9-10 Then his wife said to him, “Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die.” But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. Shall we receive good from God, and shall we not receive evil?” In all this Job did not sin with his lips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this also comes the Jewish custom to speak a blessing even when one hears bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This law includes the prohibitions on making false oaths, swearing falsely in the name of the LORD, or taking the LORD’s name in vain.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems here too, the Torah’s laws on blasphemy apply to Gentiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostles saw the second law as self-evident to the gentile believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would not have been necessary to repeat this for new gentile believers in Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their idolatrous world, they believed that to speak poorly of a deity was to invite his or her wrath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not exactly the same, the same general mindset would have transferred over to their new belief in Jesus and God the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not murder or participate in bloodshed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another self-evident command the apostles saw no need to repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every civilization that has ever existed condemns murder, though they have different definitions as to what constitutes murder (as does our American society by the way. Think about it.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At a basic level, Judaism and western societies draw a distinction between murder and killing accidentally without intent (manslaughter), killing in self-defense, killing in war, or killing in capital punishment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the flood, God allowed Cain to live and this was correlated to the wickedness of Cain’s line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in Genesis 9, God prescribes the death penalty for murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included with the prohibition not to murder, includes conspiracy to commit murder even if the person in question does not literally murder the person (David for example), and the killing of oneself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps an area where the Torah goes further would be to say that a Jew who is able to prevent the death of another and fails to do so transgresses the prohibition against murder. Jewish law also provided Cities of Refuge where an assailant could claim manslaughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish law also has laws against evil speech and character assassination, which the Torah equates with murder. Lev 19:16 You shall not go around as a slanderer among your people, and you shall not stand up against the life of your neighbor: I am the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus similarly affirmed evil speech and anger was murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 5: 21-24: “You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.’ But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the hell of fire. So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First, be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that it doesn’t say if you have something against your brother, but if your brother has something against you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Gentile non-believers may have a slightly lower standard for murder than what the Torah prescribes for Jewish people, but followers of Jesus have the same expectations as the intent of the Torah regarding murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.07843in;height:4.05114in&#34; alt=&#34;A picture containing stone Description automatically generated&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not commit sexual immorality / engage in illicit sexuality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages derived this command from Genesis 2:24 Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh” and the repeated commands to “be fruitful and multiply.” The sages viewed fornication and all other forms of sexual immorality as the antitheses of this command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mankind and our sinful desires try to define this as narrowly as possible, but the sages are clear that sexual relations with anyone other than one’s spouse are forbidden, and this applies to all gentiles by virtue of the command coming in Genesis 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet many cultures redefined what is and is not sexual immoral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one went into a temple prostitute, that was an act of worship because you wanted God to bless the fertility of your crops, so that was ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Greek and roman times, this later morphed into sex acts for general blessing (if you wanted pan, the goat god to bless you, it was bad luck to be a goat).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the culture the gentile converts were emerging from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To all of this, the Torah said absolutely not. Sex was to be between a man and his wife just as it was decreed in Genesis 2. All other unions were forbidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Acts 15:20, the apostles affirmed that Torah’s definition and standards of “Sexual immorality” apply to gentile followers of Jesus. They drew this authority from Leviticus 18:26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Lev 18:26&lt;/sup&gt; But you shall keep my statutes and my rules and do none of these (sexual) abominations, either the native or the stranger who sojourns among you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 26 follows a list of forbidden sexual unions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Torah passage concludes by saying that these unions are abominations that are prohibited not only for the native Jew but for the ger toshav, the stranger who sojourns among you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess what, they still apply to Gentile followers of Jesus today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This issue is one that truly needed clarification and redefining for new believers exiting the world of idolatry and immorality. Therefore, we have the statement in Acts 15 regarding sexual purity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo above from one room of a brothel discovered in Pompeii, along with graphic artwork and inscriptions, provides an illustration of the degraded practices of the Roman world that new Gentile believers would be coming from.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bolen concludes, “Sexual immorality was rampant in the Greco-Roman world and church leaders made it clear that non-Jewish followers of Messiah could have no part in such activities.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not steal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dishonest dealings and robbery were factors that brought on the flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Includes not only theft of personal property, but kidnapping, swindling, extortion, dishonesty, overcharging, unjust weights, moving boundary stones, encroaching on another’s livelihood, and paying dishonest wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Torah includes seduction and rape (as well as other forms of assault) under the theft prohibitions as there is theft of dignity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any act that takes advantage of someone else is prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The non-believing gentile world may not agree with these definitions of “theft,” but, as we are seeing, Gentile believers in Jesus must follow the Torah’s standards for ethical conduct and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This topic was globally understood and did not need to be repeated by the Acts 15 council. Although as we grow in Christ our level of ethics should grow as well. Paul will touch on these themes in his letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establish courts of justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is inferred from Genesis 9:6 “Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed, for God made man in his own image.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to having this be binding on all gentiles, the sages viewed it as implying that trials for capital crimes must be done in a lawful, fair, and just manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Torah’s many laws of justice, legal procedure, litigation, tort law, fines, penalties, and rules are included in this category” that apply universally to all human beings.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establish courts of justice is more of a national command than an individual one, but still, the general concept was understood and did not need to be restated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not eat meat with lifeblood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question regarding extent the Jewish dietary restrictions should be applied to gentiles permeates throughout the New Testament and into the book of Revelation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the Noachide prohibition applies to eating animals that are still alive, which (thankfully) by modern 21st-century standards in our culture is repulsive to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding dietary purity, we have a clear difference between Jewish dietary laws and those of the gentile world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While both Jews and Gentiles could not eat an animal that is alive, Jews are further prohibited from eating animals that were not slaughtered appropriately. Deuteronomy 14 even says that if a Jew comes across an animal that has died of itself, he may give it to a gentile to eat but he himself may not eat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jews are also restricted from eating certain classes of animals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We gentiles may think there are only two categories of food for Jews,“clean and unclean”, but there are actually three – and unclean food may not be what you think it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean Food – “clean” animals approved by the Torah AND sacrificed/prepared in a kosher manner according to the Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unclean Food – “clean” animals approved by the Torah BUT NOT sacrificed/prepared in a kosher manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Not food&lt;/u&gt; – “unclean” animals not approved by the Torah for food (this list includes pork and shellfish)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unclean animals are not unclean food. Unclean animals are not food at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we may have a little departure from the previous Noachide laws as they apply to Gentile Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Acts 15, the apostles give three specific commands from the Torah (no food with lifeblood, no food sacrificed to idols, and no strangled animals), but appear to stop short of imposing the full gamut of kosher food laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:5.40556in&#34; alt=&#34;A picture containing text, indoor, plant, jar Description automatically generated&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;9&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food sacrificed to idols”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostles drew this from Leviticus 17:7-9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Lev 17:7-9&lt;/sup&gt; So they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices to goat demons, after whom they whore. This shall be a statute forever for them throughout their generations. “And you shall say to them, Any one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among them, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice and does not bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to offer it to the LORD, that man shall be cut off from his people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the inclusion of house of Israel OR the stranger who sojourns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is different from the general prohibition on idolatry, which as we already looked at was self-evident and did not need to be repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prohibitions on things sacrificed to idols goes one step further “It requires a heightened distancing from idolatry based upon the Torah’s prohibitions” that apply not only to the house of Israel but also to the strangers who sojourn among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to remember EVERYTHING in the roman empire was sacrified to idols. This restriction would have presented a major hardship for gentile believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo above shows a man bringing offerings to an altar.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol start=&#34;10&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And from blood”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostles drew this from Leviticus 17:10-11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Lev 17:10-11&lt;/sup&gt; “If any one of the house of Israel or of the strangers who sojourn among them eats any blood, I will set my face against that person who eats blood and will cut him off from among his people. For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it for you on the altar to make atonement for your souls, for it is the blood that makes atonement by the life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blood restriction is in the context of diet and is not the same as murder which the apostles believed was self-evident and did not need to be repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prohibition on blood appears to mirror Genesis 9 but many had come to interpret Genesis 9 as not eating an animal while it’s still alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other cultures held that ingesting blood in other contexts was ok and some pagan rituals involving blood had emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Egyptians had no issue with drinking the blood of animals. This photo shows a model slaughter house where they are collecting blood from butchered cattle to make blood pudding.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;8.  The apostles are saying Gentile converts are to have no part of this and are held to the same standards as Jews. Again we see the phrase “house of Israel or of the strangers who sojourn among them.”
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;11&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And from things strangled”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostles drew this authority from Leviticus 17:12-14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Lev 17:12-14&lt;/sup&gt; Therefore I have said to the people of Israel, No person among you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger who sojourns among you eat blood. “Any one also of the people of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among them, who takes in hunting any beast or bird that may be eaten &lt;u&gt;shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth.&lt;/u&gt; For the life of every creature is its blood: its blood is its life. Therefore I have said to the people of Israel, You shall not eat the blood of any creature, for the life of every creature is its blood. Whoever eats it shall be cut off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, gentile believers should only be eating food that has been slaughtered and drained properly. We could call this kosher slaughter, but there is a caveat that modern kashrut standards are much stricter than what is outlined in the Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example is that modern standards hold that the back portion of a clean animal is not kosher unless the sciatic nerve is excised, which is a complicated and expensive process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless that is done, no fliet mignion or chicken thighs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a tradition that draws on a statement about Jacob’s hip, that is not directly stated in the Bible with regards to muscle meat from a clean animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are left to speculate whether it is consistent for Jewish apostles to all of a sudden say category 3 above is now OK to eat, versus whether they only intended to permit certain foods from category 2 but continued to prohibit category 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, we do know that a late 1st-century document called The Didache, contained this instruction for new believers: “Concerning (the Jewish) food (laws): do as much as you are able” (Didache 6:3).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than insisting we have the freedom in Christ to eat pork and shrimp, we don’t give a lot of thought to what we eat with respect to the dietary restrictions listed in Acts 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet will you notice how important the issue was to the early church. This debate continued throughout the first century and was not settled by the time we get to the seven churches in Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus had to remind several churches regarding his expectations for clean eating as well as sexual purity (are the two linked somehow?). &lt;sup&gt;Rev 2:14&lt;/sup&gt; But I have a few things against you: you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, &lt;strong&gt;so that they might eat food sacrificed to idols and practice sexual immorality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that the four requirements of Acts 15 appear to be taken from the Noachide laws, or at least bear some similarity. “The existence of the laws of Noah explains why the apostles felt no need to write out a new (set of rules) for the Gentiles, or to spell out the obvious moral and ethical statutes of Judaism such as prohibitions on murder, theft, idolatry, etc. All these laws already applied to all human beings.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a classification, the first gentile believers are in a different class. They are more than simply “sons of Noah” who fall under the Noachide laws, yet the Acts 15 council determined that they are not full Jews (nor do they need to be) who are subject to the complete body of Jewish law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should note that the apostles were not teaching this was the maximum in terms of personal behavior that gentile believers needed to do. The four prohibitions were merely a common starting point for new believers coming out of idolatry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note another subtle point: those who say Christians are “no longer under the Torah” are simply incorrect. The authority behind the Acts 15 apostolic decree confirms this. We are held to a higher standard of ethics and behavior than a non-believing gentile. We are more than simply sons of Noah. We are sons of Messiah. Of course note the chronology: the new gentile believers came to faith in Messiah and THEN were given the commands. We don’t keep biblical laws to get saved; we keep applicable Biblical laws because we already are saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, as we mature as believers, we will want to become more and more like Jesus. This means the way the world does things, or even many of our own former ways will no longer feel right to us. The expectation was that the four prohibitions were a starting point. The new gentile believers were to continue to meet weekly in Jewish synagogues and study Torah. As they did this they would be expected to grow in maturity and, gradually take on more of the Torah’s laws as a thank you to the God who saved them. We should be doing this too. We can apply The Didache’s words to just about any aspect of our behavior as we mature: “do as much as you are able.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time we will take a look at the Table of Nations and the Tower of Babel in Genesis chapters 10 and 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be our final lesson on what we refer to as the “pre-history” section of Genesis. This is a bit of a misnomer as we have plenty of history, but the end of chapter 11 marks a (perhaps THE) major turning point in the book. In chapter 12, the attention shifts to one man, Abraham, and the rest of the Bible will be about Abraham’s descendants and heirs by adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10 and 11 are best read as a single narrative. It’s a genealogy of Noah’s three sons, with specific “interruptions” to let the reader know of noteworthy details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:1 Noah’s genealogy begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:8-12 – an interruption in the genealogy for details on Nimrod&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:18-19- an interruption to provide details on the Canaanites&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:21 – interruption to remind the reader that Shem is the father of Eber, several generations later (Shem, Arphaxad, Salah, Eber)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:25 – interruption to tell us the earth was divided in the days of Peleg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:30 – interruption to tell us the borders of Joktan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:1-9 – interruption to tell us about the Tower of Babel incident&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:27 – the genealogy of Shem concludes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:28-32 – Transition to Abram’s narrative and segue to chapter 12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-101-noahs-three-sons&#34;&gt;Gen 10:1 Noah’s three sons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VERY IMPORTANT: As Walton says in his commentary, “there is no attempt (in the text) to link these peoples to racial divisions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse five tells us the focus is describing the peoples in terms of language, clan (family groups), and nationality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 10 is called the table of nations (not the table of races); divisions along race are just that, divisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know who it is who likes to keep us divided. Satan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all one race, that of Noah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even to say this is a division among “ethnicities” becomes a problem because as the centuries pass, the ethnic lines become intermingled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I like the word “clan” as the ESV uses in verse 5. A tribe or nation as used by Native Americans is also a good mental picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These names aren’t races or ethnicities as much as they are family groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today people who appear to be white Europeans can actually be members of the Choctaw or Cherokee nation by virtue of family connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For another example, my last name is “Flanagan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this is a distinctively Irish surname, it would be an error to look at my last name and conclude I’m 100% Irish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would also be an error to look at my last name and assume my nation is Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people marry and move, things change over time, but the male’s family name (usually) stays the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could rightfully join the Clan of Flanagan by virtue of my name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible’s focus is on the clans of the Ancient Near East: northern Africa, Syria-Palestine, and Mesopotamia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take it on faith that the other people groups (east and south Asia, Europe, southern Africa, indigenous peoples of north and south America) came from one of the descendants of Shem, Ham, or Japheth, or perhaps a co-mingling; but, these peoples are not enumerated in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Divine Narrator/Author lists 70 names here; this will be later contrasted against the number of Jacob’s family that will enter Egypt in Gen 46.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of these names may be the names of tribes or nations rather than specific individuals – we can’t know for sure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From these and other references (such as the 70 elders in Exodus 24), 70 is said to be symbolic of totality or depending on the context, the totality of the &lt;em&gt;gentile&lt;/em&gt; nations (with 12 later becoming the number of Israel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, the word “goyim” means both “nations” and “gentiles”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we go through the Bible, we’ll find that Israel is not one of the nations; Israel is to be set apart from the gentile nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:4.64375in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.33333in;height:4.43056in&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-102-5-the-line-of-japheth&#34;&gt;Gen 10:2-5: The Line of Japheth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. The sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. From these the coastland peoples spread in their lands, &lt;strong&gt;each with his own language, by their clans, in their nations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on what we know, the descendants listed of Japheth do not share contiguous land borders but are connected on the basis of being by the sea.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verse 5 “coastland peoples” (ESV), or “maritime peoples” (NIV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the biblical stage unfolds, we will see the main conflict is primarily going to be between the peoples of Ham and Shem. We might think of Japheth as seated in the audience around the stage taking it all in (for the most part):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the map, Asia Minor (Tubal, Meshech, and Togarmah = Turkey), the Greek Islands, Cyprus, The steppes of Russia (along the Black Sea), Persia (Afghanistan, Iran), although Elam which is usually associated with Persia is listed under Shem. Madai = Medes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some suggest “Riphath” and “Europe” are linguistically connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarshish is the one that puzzles scholars&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibly along the west coast of Turkey, at least at one time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city is referenced many times in the Old Testament&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is arguably most famous for being the intended destination of Jonah; when he was told to preach in Ninevah, he wanted to go in the opposite direction as far away as possible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Turkish city up the coast from Joppa in the same general direction as Ninevah doesn’t fit the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some suggest Tarshish is related to a word for “tin,” which makes some people think of Britain (or perhaps Britain by way of Spain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Don’t confuse Tarshish with Tarsus, the name of Paul the Apostle’s home town)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashkenaz is another curious name as it later comes to denote European Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may hear the term, “Ashkenazi Jews”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jews, being a Semitic people, come from Shem, not Japheth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name probably came from the fact that there were Jews from Shem in the European lands once settled by Ashkenaz from Japheth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Jews in America are Ashkenazi because their fathers and grandfathers came from Europe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jews from Spain or Africa are typically “Sephardic Jews”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-106-20-the-line-of-ham&#34;&gt;Gen 10:6-20 The Line of Ham&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sons of Ham: Cush, Mitzraim, Put, and Canaan. The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where was Japheth spread far and wide, Ham stayed close by – Egypt and northern/eastern Africa, Arabia, Mesopotamia, and Syro-Palestine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitzraim is a somewhat unusual Hebrew dual form – perhaps in reference to upper (southern) and lower (northern) Egypt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gen-108-12-nimrod-and-babylon&#34;&gt;Gen 10:8-12 Nimrod and Babylon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cush fathered Nimrod; he was the first on earth to be a mighty man. He was a mighty hunter before the LORD. Therefore it is said, “Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD.” The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. From that land he went into Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah, and Resen between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brief narratives are unusual for ancient genealogies; however, these all focus on people and land areas that will later be significant (Babylon, Ninevah, Sidon, Sodom).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also the verb changes in verse 8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually in Chapter 10: “the sons of … were…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:8, 13, 15, 21, 25-26: “… begat/fathered …” – a clue that something is changing with this guy Nimrod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, when the Hebrew word for “begat” is used with Ham, these are the tribes/families designated for cursing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When “begat” is used with Shem, those descendants receive blessings, which will begin in Genesis chapter 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck Missler sums up Nimrod:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nimrod was responsible for the Tower of Babel. It was he who attempted to bring together the human race after the Flood in an effort to get them united into a nation in which he could become the great world ruler. He was the rebel, the founder of Babel, and the hunter of the souls of men. He was the lawless one, and he is a shadow or a type of the last world ruler, the Antichrist who is yet to appear. The first great civilization, therefore, came out from the sons of Ham. – Chuck Missler&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nimrod “before” the LORD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word for “before” is liphnei and it literally means “in the face of” the LORD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can have a plain rendering of before the LORD, like you and I might show some important person the proper degree of respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also have a nuanced meaning, the way we think of it when we say someone got in the face of someone else&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most conservative translators render this with a nuanced meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Christian Hebrew linguist Franz Delitzsch says this: “Nimrod was mighty in hunting, and that in opposition to (the LORD) not &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; in the sense of according to the purpose and the will of (the LORD), (which is) irreconcilable with the context. The name Nimrod, from &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;מָרַד&lt;/span&gt;, “we will revolt,” points to some violent resistance to God.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditions involving Nimrod:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the originator of idolatry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the first world-dictator&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nimrod begat the line of the Pharohs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the builder of the Tower of Babel (Bab-El gateway to G/god)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pagan tradition even ascribes to him supernatural beginnings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know he founded Babylon and we can infer he had a kingdom of some significance, but the Author doesn’t tell us who spearheaded the Babel building project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding his divinity, according to the Bible, “Nimrod is clearly a human hero rather than divine or semi-divine.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster writes, “Just as we regard Abraham as the father of our faith, we can regard Nimrod as the father of idolatry.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Walton, the description given in verses 8-12 “corresponds to the growth of the first known empire in history, the dynasty of Agade ruled by Sargon (about 2300 BC). Nimrod’s kingdom included Erech, the city where Gilgamesh reigned and one of the oldest and greatest centers of Sumerian culture.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gen-1013-20-mitzraiym-egypt&#34;&gt;Gen 10:13-20 Mitzraiym (Egypt)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitzraiym &lt;strong&gt;fathered&lt;/strong&gt; Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, Pathrusim, Casluhim (from whom the Philistines came), and Caphtorim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In some manuscripts, the Philistines are listed separately; the ESV here follows the majority opinion that the Philistines came from Casluhim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gen-1015-18-canaan-and-the-ites&#34;&gt;Gen 10:15-18 Canaan and the “ites”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canaan fathered Sidon his firstborn and Heth, and the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. &lt;strong&gt;Afterward the clans of the Canaanites dispersed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heth probably refers to Hittites, a formidable empire from 1600-700 BCE with it’s principal city Carchemish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Esau would later marry into the tribe of Hittites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some link the “Sinites” to far-east Asia (sino- is a prefix meaning China)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently there was a lot of inter-mingling of Canaan after they dispersed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canaanites later become &lt;em&gt;ethnically&lt;/em&gt; identified as Semitic peoples, but here the origin is the family of Canaan from Ham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the Jebusites, as they will be the ones in control over Jerusalem at the time of Saul and David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidon is loosely synonymous with Lebanon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, geographic boundaries and names change over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the territory of the Canaanites extended from Sidon in the direction of Gerar as far as Gaza, and in the direction of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. These are the sons of Ham, by their clans, their languages, their lands, and their nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-1021-32-shem--abrahams-line&#34;&gt;Gen 10:21-32 Shem – Abraham’s Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gen-1021-22&#34;&gt;Gen 10:21-22&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shem goes last because he’s the one the Author wants us to focus on and remember.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To &lt;strong&gt;Shem&lt;/strong&gt; also, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, children were born. The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, &lt;strong&gt;Arpachshad&lt;/strong&gt;, Lud, and Aram. The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The father of the children of Eber” is the author’s way of saying, “Head’s up; this is YOUR ancestral line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Hebrew” and “Eber” are linguistically related.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are big-time players on the world stage: Elam = Persia/Iran; Asshur = Assyria; Aram = Arameans&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asshur was the capital of Assyria from 2025-879 BCE (If you’re wondering about the answer to a trivia question posed in a certain Monty python movie. Although the bridge keeper asked, “what IS the capital of Assyria?” In AD 932, Assyria ceased to exist. It sounds like a trick question all the way around. Not that it mattered to Brave Sir Robin.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll bold Abraham’s forefathers (see also Luke 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gen-1024-25-arphaxad&#34;&gt;Gen 10:24-25: Arphaxad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arpachshad fathered &lt;strong&gt;Shelah&lt;/strong&gt;; and Shelah fathered &lt;strong&gt;Eber&lt;/strong&gt;. To Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was &lt;strong&gt;Peleg&lt;/strong&gt;, for in his days the earth was divided, and his brother&amp;rsquo;s name was Joktan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “days when the earth was divided” is often assumed to be a reference to the Tower of Babel incident, but we aren’t told this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It potentially could reference some other significant event such as famine before the Tower that triggered a drastic migration of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this event is referenced in Genesis 11:2: “And as people migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gen-1026-31-joktan&#34;&gt;Gen 10:26-31: Joktan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;26 Joktan fathered Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, Obal, Abimael, Sheba, Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan. The territory in which they lived extended from Mesha in the direction of Sephar to the hill country of the east. These are the sons of Shem, by their clans, their languages, their lands, and their nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheba&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determining people groups is further complicated by the fact that more than one person had the name “Sheba,” who is also mentioned as a son of Ham in verse 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheba (and Dedan, a son of Ham) are generally considered associated with the Arabian peninsula, as are Ophir and Havilah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some suggest the two Shebas are the same person because of intermingling between the tribes of Shem and Ham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arabs are very much Semitic peoples as they are not just sons of Shem, but sons of Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gen-1032-conclusion&#34;&gt;Gen 10:32 Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the clans of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies, in their nations, and from these the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Author reminds His readers that all families came from Noah, but we get more detail on those families that were of unique interest to Israel by using the word “begat” instead of “the sons of…”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-111-9-the-tower-of-babel&#34;&gt;Gen 11:1-9: The Tower of Babel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Now the whole earth had one language and the same words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:5.27986in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the names in the genealogies, many scholars conclude the one language was likely Hebrew. The names listed in Genesis 5, 10, and 11 all have meaning in Hebrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Walton, “Many features of this account point to the end of the fourth millennium (~3000 BCE) as the setting of the narrative.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2-4 And as people migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. And they said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shinar is in the lower region of the Tigris-Euphrates basin, possibly equivalent to ancient “Sumer.” Ur was one of the principal cities in this area but there was also an Ur much further up river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they say “lest we be scattered” they probably are not thinking of a judgment directly, but likely the life of a nomad, moving from place to place to survive in response to drought, flooding or famine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing people to live closer to an urban area would be something that prevents scattering. All the necessary services, including religious temples, would be nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People living in proximity would enable economies of scale such as “large-scale irrigation and excess grain production.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at it is through urbanization people didn’t need to rely on the gods to meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The life of Abraham will be the opposite of this. Abraham is frequently on the move, relying on God to direct his steps. Sometimes he succeeds and other times he fails. We’ll get to that in the next few lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While urbanization sounds practical, we are reminded that God’s instructions were to multiply and fill the earth, not congregate in one location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In English, it might be easy to come away thinking, “they wanted to build a tall building. What’s the problem with that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s response makes it clear this was a religious temple built as act of pride and arrogance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take the traditions and legends about Nimrod and combine them with the biblical text that tells us he was in defiance of the Lord, we can presume Nimrod founded a dictatorship that was anti-God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They wanted to make a name for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the tower is a way of saying, “we can ascend to heaven on our own, without You, God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing they were afraid of is what came to pass – being dispersed over the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5-9 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of man had built. And the LORD said, “Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another&amp;rsquo;s speech.” So the LORD dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth. And from there the LORD dispersed them over the face of all the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a bit of a pun in “God came down to see”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ziggurat was built so the people could climb up to see the gods and, conversely, the gods could come down to see the people in order to bless them and be worshipped by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God came down alright but not in the way they were thinking. And I doubt he needed to take the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this point forward, Babylon represents those in opposition to the one true God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 13,14 and Jeremiah 50,51 talk about the doom and destruction of Babylon in terms “like Sodom and Gomorrah.” Revelation 17 and 18 tell us of Babylon’s final end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who rebel against God will be dispersed but God is longing to bring us together as one family. When He gathers us in, it will be on His terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.” (Mar 13:27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;love-your-neighbor-be-interpersonal-bereans&#34;&gt;Love Your Neighbor: Be Interpersonal Bereans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We should not condemn people without a proper investigation.” – Rabbi Pliskin&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God, of course, did not need to come down from Heaven to see the wickedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pliskin notes that the Bible describes God’s personal investigation into the Tower of Babel matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was to teach us that we should not condemn based on hearsay or circumstantial evidence, but form conclusions based only on what we can prove. “We must view a person favorably unless we have carefully investigated the matter and have established beyond a doubt that he is guilty.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We focus on being Bereans when it comes to Bible study. We need to be Bereans with each other as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give others the benefit of the doubt unless you also “came down to see” it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I, therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.” (Eph 4:1-3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;babylon-vs-jerusalem&#34;&gt;Babylon vs. Jerusalem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler often quips that the Bible is a tale of two cities, Jerusalem and Babylon, and here we see the beginning of Babylon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know from our Revelation study that Babylon will be the center of the kingdom that rises in opposition to God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether this is literal Babylon on the banks of the Euphrates, or a spiritual Babylon on the banks of the literal Thames, Hudson, or Potomac, or somewhere else we aren’t sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, Revelation depicts the person we know as the Antichrist ruling Babylon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the combination of what we know from the Bible and taking into account the tradition, it makes sense to consider Nimrod a foreshadowing of the Antichrist figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and Last world dictators&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babylon rises and falls&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mankind rises in defiance of the LORD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also references in Isaiah 10, 14, and Micah 5 to “The Assyrian” and this becomes another name for the Antichrist. What was the capital of Assyria when the prophets were writing? Ninevah (705-612 BCE). Who founded Ninevah? Nimrod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-1110-26-shems-descendants-to-abraham&#34;&gt;Gen 11:10-26 Shem’s descendants to Abraham&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the generations of Shem. When Shem was 100 years old, he fathered Arpachshad two years after the flood. And Shem lived after he fathered Arpachshad 500 years and had other sons and daughters. When Arpachshad had lived 35 years, he fathered Shelah. And Arpachshad lived after he fathered Shelah 403 years and had other sons and daughters. When Shelah had lived 30 years, he fathered Eber. And Shelah lived after he fathered Eber 403 years and had other sons and daughters. When Eber had lived 34 years, he fathered Peleg. And Eber lived after he fathered Peleg 430 years and had other sons and daughters. When Peleg had lived 30 years, he fathered Reu. And Peleg lived after he fathered Reu 209 years and had other sons and daughters. When Reu had lived 32 years, he fathered Serug. And Reu lived after he fathered Serug 207 years and had other sons and daughters. When Serug had lived 30 years, he fathered Nahor. And Serug lived after he fathered Nahor 200 years and had other sons and daughters. When Nahor had lived 29 years, he fathered Terah. And Nahor lived after he fathered Terah 119 years and had other sons and daughters. When Terah had lived 70 years, he fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Narrator is gradually drawing us in from all the families on the earth, to one family: Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list gets a little murky as we have a Nahor named after his grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In describing Jesus’ line through Abraham and back to Adam, Luke 3:36 mysteriously adds a “Cainan” between Shelah and Arphaxad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be a copyists error&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is noteworthy that when Hebrew says “the father of”, it doesn’t have to mean the person of the immediately preceding generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grandfathers and great-great-great grandfathers could all be said to be the father of someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gen-1127-28-terahs-line&#34;&gt;Gen 11:27-28 Terah’s line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27 Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran fathered Lot. Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his kindred, in Ur of the Chaldeans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two candidates for Ur, which is where Abram lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton notes that at the time of the setting of the story the Chaldeans were settled primarily in northern Mesopotamia. This Ur is not far from Haran and is possibly slightly more likely as the trip between the two cities is more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another reference to Abraham’s home is “Paddan Aram,” which would line up with a northern location of Ur.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on when this was written, the Chaldeans had migrated south, and in fact, Chaldea becomes a synonym of Babylon (Jeremiah 50:10, 51:24, and particularly Ezekiel 23:15: “…a likeness of Babylonians whose native land was Chaldea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the southern Ur was a famous Sumerian city, Walton speculates that “Ur of the Chaldees” is possibly the northern city, since the southern city would have just been known as “Ur.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upper map is from the Satellite Bible Atlas, where Dr. Schlaegel holds to the southern Ur location.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower map is from the Moody Bible Atlas, where Dr. Beitzel holds to a norther Ur location.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good scholars can disagree!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.png&#34; style=&#34;width:4.45767in;height:3.74526in&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image5.png&#34; style=&#34;width:4.41475in;height:2.41255in&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Abram and Nahor took wives. The name of Abram&amp;rsquo;s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor&amp;rsquo;s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and Iscah. Now Sarai was barren; she had no child. Terah took Abram his son and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram&amp;rsquo;s wife, and they went forth together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the land of Canaan, but when they came to Haran, they settled there. The days of Terah were 205 years, and Terah died in Haran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nahor is going to be a name to remember since he turns out to be the grandfather of Rebekah and Laban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebekah will marry Abraham’s son Isaac&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laban has two daughters Rachael and Leah, who will marry Jacob and produce the 12 tribes; Laban will be a source of grief for Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is going to take place in Haram, or you might see the name “Padan Aram” which is the name of the general region around Haran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to think like an ancient – the narrative is flowing along with a list of names and them BOOM! We have a big problem. Sarai was barren; she had no child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram is supposed to be the hero yet for a moment it looks like his line will end. Also, since the command from God was to be fruitful and multiply, barrenness was seen as a judgment from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course they knew the rest of the story just as we do but the drama would have been palpable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 7 adds an interesting tidbit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis doesn’t tell us that it was GOD who told the family to set out from Ur of the chaldeans, but acts 7:2-3 says the Glory of God appeared to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is great example of how the old and new testaments are really one book&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also an aspect of Abraham from Acts that we can miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Acts, God told Abraham to go from Ur to the land of Canaan, yet Abraham stopped in Haran. Was this a lack of faith? Canaan is a long way away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gives new meaning to the word “settled”, which in English is a fantastic pun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They settled in harah, meaning they stopped and live there for a while&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also settled FOR haran, meaning God had more in store for Abraham but Abraham settled for something less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sons-of-abraham&#34;&gt;Sons of Abraham&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the Bible will be focused on Abraham and his descendants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish people are Abraham’s legal descendants while the disciples of Jesus are Abraham’s spiritual descendants by faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul, in various places, confirms that, through Jesus, gentile disciples can rightly refer to him as “Abraham, our father.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as it is true that not all biological descendants of Abraham (such as Ishmaelites and Edomites) can claim the promises, not all Gentiles and even not all gentiles who profess a belief in Jesus can make this claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster: “The critical paternity test is this question: ‘Are you walking in the footsteps of Abraham’s faith?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“(The &lt;em&gt;Ioudaioi)&lt;/em&gt; answered him, “Abraham is our father.” Jesus said to them, “If you were Abraham&amp;rsquo;s children, you would be doing the works Abraham did” (John 8:39).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement is true of Christians who claim spiritual inheritance as much as it is of Jews who claim physical inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what were the works of Abraham?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages list 10 specific trials of Abraham; some he passed and some he failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ten Tests of Abraham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call from his homeland&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The famine in Canaan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abduction of Sarah in Egypt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The war with the four kings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wait for a son and his marriage to Hagar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circumcision&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abduction of Sarah by Abimelech&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Exile of Hagar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Exile of Ishmael&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sacrifice of Isaac&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, Abraham stood against idolatry and was willing to sacrifice his life for his convictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believers are to emulate Abraham where he succeeded and learn from Abraham where he failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let us study Abraham with a view toward strengthening our personal discipleship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Schlegel notes, our faith is founded on events that took place in time and space (history and geography).&lt;/p&gt;

Eliezer and Jacob would have followed the same roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;to-shechem&#34;&gt;To Shechem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image3.png&#34; style=&#34;width:5.44444in;height:5.36111in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Moody Bible Atlas map&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; shows the suggested route (solid green line) through Damascus. Abram possibly acquired the servant Eleazar at this time. Eleazar will be a pivotal supporting character in the story of Abram. As Abram’s eldest servant, he stood to inherit Abram’s estate if Abram had no natural offspring. Eleazar means God’s Helper and in many ways, we will see he is a biblical type of the Holy Spirit, especially in Genesis 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image4.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.27986in;height:9in&#34; /&gt;This Satellite Bible Atlas map&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; shows the journey to Shechem, through the center of the country to the Negev, and then eventually to Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Shechem, then Bethel (Luz) and Ai, then Negev&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We don’t know exactly how he got to Shechem, but the Wadi Far’a is a good inland road from the Jordan valley.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God visits Abram and promises inheritance to Abram’s seed and Abram builds an altar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He next moves to an area between Bethel and Ai.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ai is familiar to those who have studied Joshua as the place where the Israelites were defeated because there was “sin in the camp” – the lesson is that we are all in a community – when one member sins, we all sin and suffer the consequences. We usually think of our faith as individualistic. My business is between God and me; the Bible teaches both individual and corporate/community accountability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He then moved further south to the Negev past Hebron&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Egypt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abram has gained great wealth but appears to show a lack of faith (we note that it is commonly taught he shows a lack of faith but the text doesn’t say this so we need to be careful with our assumptions).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Egypt is generally viewed as a type of the world with its enticements and trappings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He places his wife in harm’s way while he accumulates more possessions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Later we will learn that Abram picked up a concubine named Hagar who would ensnare him with Ishmael as a false substitute for God’s promises&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can’t fault Abram for this – he is a picture of us when we try to help God along. This is something the enemy tempts us with every day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God’s promises are unconditional and will be fulfilled despite Abram’s failure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-121-5--god-calls-abram-to-canaan&#34;&gt;Genesis 12:1-5 – God calls Abram to Canaan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Now the LORD said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father&amp;rsquo;s house to the land that I will show you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great so that you will be a blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you, all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a spectacular blessing of which you and I are the beneficiaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note there are seven distinct promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul says the promises to Abraham are also given to Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, “And to offsprings,” referring to many, but referring to one, “And to your offspring,” who is Christ” (Gal 3:16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great nation – Galatians 3:29 And if you are Christ&amp;rsquo;s, then you are Abraham&amp;rsquo;s offspring, heirs according to promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessings Bestowed - Ephesians 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Great Name - Philippians 2:9-10 Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessings to others - Galatians 3:14 so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessings returned - Matthew 25:34 Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. (those things done for the least of these are done unto Him).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curses returned - Matthew 25:41 “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.’ (those things not done to the least of these were not done unto Him.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the families of the earth –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 3:25 You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 3:8 And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you shall all the nations be blessed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leaving his father’s house, Abram would be forfeiting his earthly inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this as, for the next couple of decades, Abram is childless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the back of his mind, he could have been thinking about what he could have had if he’d stayed put, versus the seemingly unfulfilled promise from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton: “When Abram gave up his place in his father’s household, he forfeited his security. He was putting his survival, his identity, his future, and his security in the hands of the LORD.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God calls us just as he did Abram. Like He does with us, He only asks us to take the next step in obedience (he won’t tell us the whole plan, or we might say no).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going” (Hebrews 11:8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone in the world at that time practiced idolatry. In what I believe is a model of our salvation process, God selected Abram, then he called Abram. Abram did nothing to merit the selection but he did have the free will to reject God’s call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 So Abram went, as the LORD had told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we noted last time, Acts 7 tells us the command from God came when Abram was in Ur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Abram sojourned in Haran suggests a lack of faith on his part;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 12:4 thus can be interpreted that God had to remind Abraham a second time of the promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can be thankful that God doesn’t give up on us when we stumble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother&amp;rsquo;s son, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people that they had acquired in Haran, and they set out to go to the land of Canaan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that Abraham is the first Hebrew because he is the first to come across (heb. &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;עבר&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ever)&lt;/em&gt; the Euphrates River. This is in addition to having a relative by the name of Eber&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 7:4-5 Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And after his father died, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living. Yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot&amp;rsquo;s length, but promised to give it to him as a possession and to his offspring after him, though he had no child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two contrasting ways to view the phrase “people that they had acquired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can literally translate as “souls they had made.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this, the sages depict Abraham as a missionary for monotheism, converting people from idolatry to the knowledge of the one true God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view is intriguing since for most of its history, Judaism has never been a proselytizing religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at it is that Abraham accumulated things and people of the world that serve to corrupt him&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we study Abram, we need to note the times when he is where he is supposed to be and those times when he is not where he is supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever he is not where he is supposed to be, Abram acquires people from that place he’s not supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Haran it was Lot and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Egypt, we will see Abram acquires a handmaid by the name of Hagar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Lot and Hagar will be sources of grief for Abram down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IHD: Both interpretations, even though they are opposite viewpoints, demonstrate the biblical theme of sowing and reaping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 6:7-8 Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap. For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we plant seeds in a place we’re not supposed to be, we shouldn’t be surprised at the consequences – we’ll touch on this again when we get to the story of Abraham and Hagar. Abraham acted in the flesh and there are consequences of his action to this day; but we could go back further and say the problem started when he went to Egypt and acquired Hagar in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, If we plant healthy seeds in others, eventually there will be a harvest – we may not see much fruit but our job is to plant, not to grow the tree. I can’t make a tree grow, I don’t know about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-126-9-in-canaan-the-lord-appears-again&#34;&gt;Genesis 12:6-9– in Canaan, the LORD appears again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 (When they came to the land of Canaan,) Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The honor of being the first city in Israel named in the Bible goes to Shechem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shechem has a mixed history and will ultimately be a source of grief for those who want to follow the One True God. We’ll explore this more a bit later in Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shechem lies in a valley surrounded by two mountains (hills): Mt. Gerizim and Mt. Ebal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It strategically lies at an interchange of the N-S way of the patriarchs and an E-W road, which helped it grow as a center of trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Israelites were about to go into the promised land, Moses instructed Joshua to station the tribes along the two hills. The blessings from the law were to be read from Mt. Gerizim and the cursings were to be read from Mt. Ebal. See Deuteronomy 28.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shechem is in the general vicinity of Jacob’s Well, which is the setting for the meeting between Jesus and the Samaritan Woman in John 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the woman says, “we Samaritans worship on this mountain,” she is referring to Mt. Gerizim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the Palestinian city of Nablus is adjacent to ancient Shechem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram is often associated with trees. Later we will see Abram by the Oaks of Mamre, which is further south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trees, especially large ones, were often thought to be prime teaching or studying locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically, this is because of the shade from the heat that the leaves provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symbolically, the tree representing knowledge is linked to the tree of knowledge back in Eden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trees, which tend to be somewhat phallic-shaped are symbolic of fertility and became adopted as places of worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 Then the LORD appeared to Abram and said, “To your offspring I will give this land.” So he built there an altar to the LORD, who had appeared to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 From there he moved to the hill country on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. And there he built an altar to the LORD and called upon the name of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram, an old man, had no seed at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, these altars are to a God, who would have been entirely unknown to the Canaanites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the text won’t always tell us so, it is a safe assumption that Abram built altars only when the LORD directed him to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ordinary places became holy to Abraham.” Lancaster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word for tent has a feminine suffix so it literally says, “He pitched her tent.” The Midrash comments that Abraham pitched Sarah’s tent first, then his own, which gives us men the reminder that we take care of her needs before ours. This is something that Abram will fail to do in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bethel is being used anachronistically here (technically, the $10 word is proleptic; something done in anticipation). Bethel won’t be called Bethel until Genesis 28:19. At this time of Abram, it would have been called Luz.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Istanbul, not Constantinople.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 And Abram journeyed on, still going toward the Negeb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Negev region of southern Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He would have passed through the cities that would later be known as Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and Hebron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1210-13--flight-to-egypt-deceiving-pharaoh&#34;&gt;Genesis 12:10-13 – Flight to Egypt, deceiving Pharaoh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lest we miss it, God told Abram to go to a land that GOD will show Abram. In verse 7, God says “THIS is the land.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, he departs for Egypt; there is no mention of building an altar and no mention that God told him to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s as if God showed Abram the promise and Abram said “thanks, I’ll take it from here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds a lot like something the person I look at in the mirror every day would do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is difficult to trust God when we think we can come up with a better plan of our own.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also if we look at it from Abram’s perspective, the so-called promised land is filled with wicked Canaanites and now there is no water, which led to a severe famine. In his mind, he had to pack up and head elsewhere to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Egypt, the Nile’s constant waters and predictable flood stages made that land impervious to famine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “I know that you are a woman beautiful in appearance,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they will kill me, but they will let you live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 Say you are my sister, that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared for your sake.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham was not necessarily a great role model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My life will be spared&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Abram concluded that, like David did with Uriah, a husband can be eliminated. A brother can be negotiated with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After they use the same tactic with Abimelech, Genesis 20:13 tells us that Abram and Sarai agreed to use this ruse way back in Mesopotamia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model will be repeated a third time with Isaac and Rebecca in Genesis 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, his life WAS spared, just as the Nation was spared after it fled to Egypt, just as the Messiah was spared after He fled to Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plagues came upon Pharaoh who let Sarai go just as plagues would come upon a different Pharaoh, who, reluctantly, would let the nation go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could take a lot of different angles here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wasn’t where he was supposed to be; so now he has to make a second bad decision as a result of his earlier bad decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is supposed to be the protector of his wife, but instead, he places her in harm’s way, while seeking to increase his financial position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He technically wasn’t fully lying. Genesis 20:12 tells us that Sarai was Abram’s ½ sister, the daughter of Terah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible is not shy about showing us the failures of its heros&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah, around 70, was a striking woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1214-16--sarai-taken-by-pharaoh&#34;&gt;Genesis 12:14-16 – Sarai taken by Pharaoh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 And when the princes of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier he said the ruse was so that “it may go well with me because of you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram got what he wanted apparently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1217-20-pharaoh-smitten-with-plagues&#34;&gt;Genesis 12:17-20 Pharaoh smitten with plagues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17 But the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram&amp;rsquo;s wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18 So Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19 Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her, and go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 And Pharaoh gave men orders concerning him, and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sudden outbreak of disease like this would have been assumed to be a divine curse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can imagine the pharaoh consulting with his magicians and them quickly determining it must have something to do with the new girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God takes marriage very seriously even when we don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can infer that God made the relationship between Sarai and Abram clear to Pharaoh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plague prevented Pharaoh from committing a greater sin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get much more information in Genesis 20, when Abraham will use the same approach with Abimelech, King of Gerar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham left Egypt a much wealthier man than when he entered, but there is a catch to everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we said in the introduction, included in the group of female servants was a handmaid named Hagar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;genesis-13&#34;&gt;Genesis 13&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 13 begins with Abraham returning to Bethel/Ai, where Abraham again worships the LORD at the altar he made previously. This is represented by the blue arrow pointing up to Bethel on the map.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this region, the Canaanites were the primary inhabitants of the land, yet Abram and Lot both had accumulated large herds that needed food and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two camps got into a turf battle, leading Abram to suggest the two separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram selflessly elects to defer to Lot, who lifts his eyes towards Sodom and departs. Lot’s movements are represented by the orange arrow and box #3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God honors Abram’s handling of this situation by reaffirming his promise. Abram then moves south to dwell in Hebron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:4.76449in;height:4.35019in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;genesis-14&#34;&gt;Genesis 14&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five kings of Canaan evidently violate a Suzerain-Vassel relationship, which leads to four kings of Mesopotamia moving into the Promised land to make war. We’ll describe what a Suzerain-Vassal treaty is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown on the map,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the kings move from north to south along the King’s Highway and are victorious over the Rephaim, Zuzim, Emim (two possible locations), and the Horites in the region of Sier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this leads up to the main narrative that as the Mesopotamians are plundering the region, they capture Lot with the intention of deporting him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram is Lot’s kinsman redeemer and thus is obligated to rescue him, which he does way up in the region of Dan (off the map to the north).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his return from rescuing Lot, on his way back to Hebron, Abram meets Melchi-zedek (King of Righteousness) at Salem (Jerusalem).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image2.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:6.27986in;height:9in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-131-4&#34;&gt;Genesis 13:1-4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negeb. Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. And he journeyed on from the Negeb as far as Bethel to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, to the place where he had made an altar at the first. And there Abram called upon the name of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we are reminded that in Genesis 12:1, Abram was supposed to go from his kindred and his father’s house. He certainly had other humans besides his wife with him but the Bible specifically tells us Lot was one of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word for “rich” in Hebrew (&lt;em&gt;caveyd, &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;כָּבֵד&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; literally means to “be weighty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Livestock, silver, and gold weigh quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a hint that riches can weigh us down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would have been around 200 miles but it was a very slow journey; if nothing else the livestock would need time to pasture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to Abram’s next test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-135-7-abrams-and-lots-men-quarrel&#34;&gt;Genesis 13:5-7: Abram’s and Lot’s men quarrel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents, so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together, and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram&amp;rsquo;s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot&amp;rsquo;s livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between April and October, rain is almost non-existent in most parts of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible also reminds us that the land Abram and Lot were in is not their own. Those wicked Canaanites, whom Noah cursed back in Genesis 9 are the primary residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not too hard to envision them tripping over each other trying to find the scarce fields and streams for their animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past 4000 years, the main source of contention in the Holy Land is water rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often think that more money is the answer, but “will you notice”…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible clearly links their large quantity of posessions with the interpersonal strife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know what happens to most Lottery jackpot winners, you probably wouldn’t wish that on your worst enemy, let alone wish it would happen to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-2&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-3&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-138-9-abram-and-lot-separate&#34;&gt;Genesis 13:8-9: Abram and Lot Separate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abram said to Lot, “Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are kinsmen. Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram passes this mini test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His age and status give him the first choice; the natural response would be to assert that right and take the best land for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram shows faith in God by letting Lot go first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, we should put others first and rely on God to meet our needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster: “Peace between brothers is more important than success or prestige.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-4&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-5&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1310-11&#34;&gt;Genesis 13:10-11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar. (This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan Valley, and Lot journeyed east. Thus they separated from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We again see the sin progression from Genesis 3 with the serpent and Eve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lot saw, he wanted, he took.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, practically, the Jordan may have been the only water around. In fact, it was like the garden of Eden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible is conspicuous that faith comes by hearing. People hear the word of the Lord and very few saw the Lord personally with their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John 20:29 Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How often do we make decisions based on what we see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cars, houses, investments, food?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we see should be part of the decision-making process; not the entirety of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-6&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-7&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1312-13&#34;&gt;Genesis 13:12-13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom. Now the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram remains in the land of Canaan where God told him to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s bad enough that Lot found Sodom appealing, but he subjects his family to that environment. We’re going to see in a few chapters an example of sowing and reaping. His daughters are not going to turn out to be model citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As parents, and especially fathers, we’re responsible for the environment we expose to our children. I’m thinking specifically about government schools that don’t simply teach things differently than how you would want them; if you are a Bible-believing parent with traditional values, you are their enemy and they are your enemy. You’re leaving your kids with your enemy for 8 hours a day. You’re dropping your kids off at Sodom Jr. High. It’s something to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you and I interact with biblical characters, we should ask ourselves how are we like Abraham and how are we like Lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lot is portrayed as selfish, worldly. He makes bad decision after bad decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, we will see in Chapter 14, that his redeemer pursues him when he is in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after this redemption, he makes more bad decisions and moves BACK to Sodom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately Lot is declared “righteous.” I would say this is true not because of who Lot was, but because of who Lot associated with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-9&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1314-16&#34;&gt;Genesis 13:14-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, “Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward, for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever. I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God blesses Abram’s passing of the test by reconfirming the covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He chose to elevate his neighbor over his personal prosperity. At its core, this is the definition of honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, God blessed Him with BOTH peace and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a further illustration, Lot acted selfishly and chose what appealed to the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a few chapters that prized location will be destroyed and turned into the wasteland we see today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this illustrates Jesus’ words: Matthew 25:29 “For to everyone who has (i.e., a heart for God like Abram) will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not (i.e., a selfish heart like Lot), even what he has will be taken away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t know how much time has passed since Genesis 12:3 but safe to say several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram may be wondering about that “offspring” thing since he is still childless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see this as God telling him to hang in there, continue to be faithful and wait on God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Abraham’s ultimate offspring is Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Galatians 3:16 Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, “And to offsprings,” referring to many, but referring to one, “And to your offspring,” who is Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-10&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-11&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1317-18&#34;&gt;Genesis 13:17-18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arise, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.” So Abram moved his tent and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron, and there he built an altar to the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In faithfulness, Abram builds an altar. We can tell when he’s passed a test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebron is about halfway between Jerusalem and Beersheba; it’s only 19 miles from Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram will later be buried in Hebron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-13&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-141-4&#34;&gt;Genesis 14:1-4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, these kings made war with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar). And all these joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea). Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to admit that there is no extra-biblical support for this passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, there is no record that the four kings of the east had any control over the Holy Land during the early 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; millennium BC at the time of Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean the Bible is wrong; in fact, it is more likely that there are gaps in our knowledge of the history of this period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, what is being described is a suzerain-vassal relationship, which is entirely consistent with how things worked in ancient society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s basically a protection racket&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A weaker king (the vassal) pays tribute to a stronger king (the suzerain) in exchange for protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then what would happen is a third party make a threat. The vassal would threaten to call the suzrain, but the new guy says, “pay me tribute then I’ll protect you from the other guy when he comes to collect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also was not uncommon for the vassal to get tired of the whole arrangement and rebel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was very common for the suzrain to not take it well whenever the vassal revolted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-145-7&#34;&gt;Genesis 14:5-7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim, and the Horites in their hill country of Seir as far as El-paran on the border of the wilderness. Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh) and defeated all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who were dwelling in Hazazon-tamar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible loves geography: they’re following the King’s Highway in Jordan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the land of the giants (Rephaim), so there may be more going on here than we realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deuteronomy 2:20-21 (It is also counted as a land of Rephaim. Rephaim formerly lived there—but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim— [21] a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim; but the LORD destroyed them before the Ammonites, and they dispossessed them and settled in their place. (Read all of Deuteronomy 2).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-148-11-the-babylonians-are-victorious&#34;&gt;Genesis 14:8-11: the Babylonians are victorious&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out, and they joined battle in the Valley of Siddim with Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar, four kings against five. Now the Valley of Siddim was full of bitumen pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them, and the rest fled to the hill country. So the enemy took all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is often called “Four Kings against Five Kings”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four Mesopotamian kings won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t think tar pits like Californians have in La Brea, a lake of sticky muck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally occurring bitumen in this region is solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pits here are more like wells, or maybe even more like mine shafts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They didn’t fall in and get stuck; the locals needed a place to hide and they knew where to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four kings routed then plundered, including deporting the population, which is a foreshadowing of the Babylonian captivity in 586 BCE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the captives was Lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-18&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-19&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1412-13-the-babylonians-take-lot-into-captivity&#34;&gt;Genesis 14:12-13: The Babylonians take Lot into captivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also took Lot, the son of Abram&amp;rsquo;s brother, who was dwelling in Sodom, and his possessions, and went their way. Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew, who was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and of Aner. These were allies of Abram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first mention of Hebrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think of the term in terms of ethnicity or religion, but Walton points out, at this time it may have been a “designation of a social class.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, it certainly could have referenced the fact that Abram and his family were not polytheistic like everyone else around them, but were worshippers of the One who will be known as the “God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1414-17-abram-rescues-lot&#34;&gt;Genesis 14:14-17: Abram rescues Lot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, 318 of them, and went in pursuit as far as Dan. And he divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and defeated them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus. Then he brought back all the possessions, and also brought back his kinsman Lot with his possessions, and the women and the people. After his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King&amp;rsquo;s Valley).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to think of “next of kin” as someone younger, but in this context, Abram was Lot’s next of kin. That means Abram, as lot’s redeemer, wasn’t just being nice; Abram had an obligation to go after Lot and rescue him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does Jesus as our Kinsman Redeemer, have an obligation to pursue us who are lost? I think He sees it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw in Revelation how there is a point where God seems to say “if you mess with My people then you’re messing with Me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine being in enemy captivity but not wanting to be rescued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the sad state of the unbeliever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Enemy knows that the best kind of enslaved person is one who doesn’t know he’s enslaved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any aspects of our lives where we are enslaved but don’t view it that way? (hurts, habits, hangups, false dichotomies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to get in the habit of viewing life through a spiritual lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that respect, the abduction of Lot is a satanic attack on the Messianic line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lot is the father of the Ammonites and the Moabites&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naamah, the Ammonite is listed as the mother of Rehoboam (2 Kings 12:12) and, more famously, Ruth, is the mother of Obed (Matthew 1:5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As both Obed and Rehoboam are in the Messianic line, Jesus has Moabite and Ammonite lineage – an attack on Lot puts that in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is everywhere in the Old Testament if you know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a sense of how wealthy Abram had become, we are told he has a security detail of 318 men; potentially the same size as the armies of each of the city-states named (but likely much inferior to the size of the combined armies of the Mesopotamian kings)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like Gideon, Abram used the tactic of dividing his already small forces in a nighttime ambush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan in this case is being used anachronistically (since Dan has not been born yet); this refers to the extreme north of the Promised Land, again up near Mt. Hermon where the demonic activity occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it’s the same location as mentioned in 2 Sam 18:18, the King’s valley is where the Kidron and the Hinnom valleys come together in Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Samuel 18:18 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself the pillar that is in the King&amp;rsquo;s Valley, for he said, “I have no son to keep my name in remembrance.” He called the pillar after his own name, and it is called Absalom&amp;rsquo;s monument to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an “Absalom’s pillar” today that dates to the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century CE, but this is not to say it couldn’t have been built over the original site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-his-dust&#34;&gt;In His Dust:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disciples do all we can to save someone in trouble.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-20&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James 4:17 So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though Lot had only himself to blame for his situation, Abraham did all he could to save him.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-21&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1418-20-melchizedek-and-abram-have-a-banquet&#34;&gt;Genesis 14:18-20: Melchizedek and Abram have a banquet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. (He was priest of God Most High.) And he blessed him and said, “Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth; and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand!” And Abram gave him a tenth of everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton speculates that Melchizedek might have been the principal king of the region. Salem is usually considered to be Jerusalem, which would make this the first reference to Jerusalem in Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psalms 76:2 His abode has been established in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“God Most High” (El Alyon) is not necessarily Our God, but is probably El, the chief Canaanite god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elements of communion get our attention. In context, the shared meal likely signifies Melchizedek’s desire to make peace with Abram and his formidable army. Abram in turn acknowledges Melchizedek’s status by paying tribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This foreshadows the Messianic banquet when we too will dine at the table with Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 8:11 I tell you, many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know almost nothing about Melchizedek (King of Righteousness); and we probably would not remember his name if it were not for Psalm 110 and Hebrews 5-7, particularly chapter 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psalms 110:4 The LORD has sworn and will not change his mind, “You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews presents a complicated distinction between a priest of Levi and a priest in the order of Melchizedek (who is both a king and a priest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Israelites offer tithes and bow to Levi/the Aaronic priesthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham could not bow down to a Levite because Levi was still in Abraham’s loins (that’s what Hebrews says!), but he could bow down to Melchizedek&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the logic, the priesthood of Melchizedek is superior to the priesthood of Aaron. Messiah belongs to a different priesthood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus does not cancel or abolish the Aaronic priesthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He merely operates in a different realm (for example, not the earthly Temple but the heavenly Temple).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the writer to Hebrews says Melchizedek is a type of Jesus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalms 110:4 says a priest in the order of Melchizedek, not “the priest Melchizedek.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 7:3 He is without father or mother or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God he continues a priest forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melchizedek was not a supernatural apparition, but no such lineage is documented. Therefore he is a type of Jesus who existed at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the Levitical priesthood, Melchizedek represents the Messianic priesthood during the Messianic era of peace (shalom/Salem), ruling from Jerusalem.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham tithes before it was mandated later in Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham tithed because it pleased God, not because it was something he was required to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also expected nothing in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another way of saying, Abraham didn’t tithe to be saved; he tithed because he already was saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-22&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading-23&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1421-the-king-of-sodom-vs-king-of-salem&#34;&gt;Genesis 14:21: The King of Sodom vs. King of Salem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The King of Sodom might be thought of as an “anti-Melchizedek.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it is clear that the Divine Narrator wants us to connect Melchizidek with the King of Sodom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Melchizedek is a type of Messiah, then the King of Sodom is a type of the Anti-messiah; otherwise known as Antichrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note we have “Jerusalem” (holy city) versus “Sodom” (wicked city)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He shows up here requesting the souls of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1422-24-abram-declines-spoils-of-war&#34;&gt;Genesis 14:22-24: Abram declines spoils of war&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have lifted my hand to the LORD, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth, that I would not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that is yours, lest you should say, ‘I have made Abram rich.’ I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me. Let Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre take their share.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is often the case, when we have a spiritual success, we are often tempted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham, who willingly gave a 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; to Melchizedek, the King of Jerusalem, refuses to give anything to the King of Sodom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram is a representative of the LORD, God Most High, and will not profit from his military action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was likely a written agreement between Abram and the King of Sodom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Genesis chapter 14 may be the text of that agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hebrews-7&#34;&gt;Hebrews 7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, and to him Abraham apportioned a tenth part of everything. He is first, by translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of Salem, that is, king of peace. He is without father or mother or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God he continues a priest forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See how great this man was to whom Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth of the spoils! And those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take tithes from the people, that is, from their brothers, though these also are descended from Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this man who does not have his descent from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior. In one case tithes are received by mortal men, but in the other case, by one of whom it is testified that he lives. One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham, for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him. Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, rather than one named after the order of Aaron?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well. For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar. For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This becomes even more evident when another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek, who has become a priest, not on the basis of a legal requirement concerning bodily descent, but by the power of an indestructible life. For it is witnessed of him, “You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.” For on the one hand, a former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness (for the law made nothing perfect); but on the other hand, a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God. And it was not without an oath. For those who formerly became priests were made such without an oath, but this one was made a priest with an oath by the one who said to him: “The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, ‘You are a priest forever.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes Jesus the guarantor of a better covenant. The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office, but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them. For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. He has no need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily, first for his own sins and then for those of the people, since he did this once for all when he offered up himself. For the law appoints men in their weakness as high priests, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;genesis-15--a-faith-completed-by-works-james-222&#34;&gt;Genesis 15 – A faith completed by works (James 2:22)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geographic setting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:5.26806in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t provided a specific location for the events in this chapter. Verse 15 references Abraham buried, which we know is Hebron, SW of Jerusalem and Bethlehem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;faith-alone&#34;&gt;Faith Alone?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 15 is an important chapter to the Apostolic Writers. Verse 6 contains the famous statement, “He (Abraham) believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This verse is directly referenced in Romans 4, Galatians 3, Hebrews 11, and James 2. This verse, along with Habakkuk 2:4, “The just shall live by faith,” are the verses that sparked the Reformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul spends an entire chapter, Romans 4, developing Abraham’s faith, and, as a compliment, James spends half of chapter two doing the same, but in a slightly different context. The famous “faith without works is dead” passage uses Abraham in Genesis 15 as a backdrop. So we’re going to need to be Bereans (Acts 17;11) and do our homework to piece all of this together to make sure we have a firm grasp of how faith and works go together. This is important because, in my humble opinion, the protestant church has largely gotten it wrong for the past 500 years by teaching “Faith Alone.” That’s not exactly what the Bible teaches. Jesus never says our works don’t matter; in fact, there are multiple passages where He essentially says, “if you love me, you will keep my commands.” (John 14:15, 14:24, 15:10, Mat 28:20, etc.). But as always, don’t believe what I say. Be a Berean and check it out for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is true is the order. Faith comes first, then obedience. We’ll see Abraham’s faith here in Chapter 15, and then we’ll see his obedience, culminating with obedience beyond all understanding in Genesis 22. God delivered the Israelites from Egypt first, then gave them the Torah, the standards of ethical behavior for His people. Jesus first says come to Me you who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest” (Mat 11:28), then he says, “(teach) them to obey all I have commanded” (Mat 28:20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be worth our time to read Romans 4 and James 2:14-26 in conjunction with Genesis 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told, Abraham occurs 75 times in the New Testament, and the events in His life that are referenced the most begin in this chapter. A firm understanding of Chapters 15, 16, 17, 21, and 22 will significantly aid our correct interpretation and application of New Testament teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-151-3&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:1-3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these things, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: “Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.” But Abram said, “O Lord GOD, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?” And Abram said, “Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God communicates in visions. They are distinct from dreams in that the recipient has no doubt the conversation really took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we remember, the chapter and verse breaks are man’s insertions; they are not divinely inspired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are used to “after these things” denoting a scene shift, but this is not to say the events after these things are not related to the events before “these things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we read the Story of Abraham as a continuous narrative, Abraham has just given 10% to Melchizedek and did not keep any spoils for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God viewed this with favor and here says, “because you refused reward from the King of Sodom, your reward from Me will be very great.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham wants to know what has become of the promises of Chapter 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a man had no son, he could legally adopt a servant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite God’s earlier promise, Abraham seems resigned to this course of action, possibly believing that Eliezer is whom God had in mind to continue Abraham’s line all along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, since we know what is about to happen with Isaac, it’s easy for us to see a lack of faith, especially since God specifically said, “your offspring.” We, as disciples, often limit God to what we can see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How patient and faithful would WE be if we were in Abraham’s shoes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliezer means “God is Help” or “God’s helper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four times in John 15, Jesus refers to the Holy Spirit as “the Helper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John 15:26 “But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this discussion when we get to Genesis 24 when the father’s (unnamed) helper goes to fetch a bride for the son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-154-5&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:4-5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And behold, the word of the LORD came to him: “This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir.” And he brought him outside and said, “Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:12 Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as many as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God IS able to number them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalms 147:4 He determines the number of the stars; he gives to all of them their names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 40:26 Lift up your eyes on high and see: who created these? He who brings out their host by number, calling them all by name; by the greatness of his might and because he is strong in power, not one is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God and Abraham had a special relationship. They speak with each other as two friends. In a few chapters, they will negotiate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James 2:23 and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”—and he was called a friend of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-156&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he believed the LORD, and he counted it to him as righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement was very important to Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 4 is Paul’s commentary on Genesis 15:6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 4:13 For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul is saying that as believers, we are to trust in God just as Abraham did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Paul, Abraham didn’t just believe God would provide a literal son in Isaac; Abraham foresaw a special son of His: the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 8:56 “Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day. He saw it and was glad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 3:29 And if you are Christ&amp;rsquo;s, then you are Abraham&amp;rsquo;s offspring, heirs according to promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Paul’s logic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God promised Abraham a seed (seed singular, not seeds plural)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham believed God’s promise regarding the seed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Seed is the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore Abraham believed in the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul used this passage as a proof-text that Gentiles did not need to convert to Judaism to be deemed righteous by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proclamation of Abraham’s faith and declaration of his righteousness came before the covenant sign and commandment to Abraham to circumcise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are deemed righteous first, and then we obey; we don’t obey to attain righteousness. When we fail, we don’t lose our status; when we fail, we realize our dependence on God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is VERY different from saying “works don’t matter at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible doesn’t teach salvation by works; but, it does teach works from salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israelites were delivered from bondage, and THEN they were given the Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James 2:20-24 Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? [You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”—and he was called a friend of God. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One remarkable aspect about the Bible is it seems to anticipate false doctrine – and what is remarkable about man is that we still get it wrong (for example, Luther reportedly said he “had no use for James.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Faith alone” is a core teaching of the Protestant Church, yet it may only be ½ correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note James is not saying “works alone justify.” A person who claims to have faith but no works might be in error about his claim to have faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 3:5-7 Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith— just as Abraham “believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”? Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul makes it clear he is basing his arguments FROM the Torah, not outside of the Torah: Romans 3:31 Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-157-8&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:7-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he said to him, “I am the LORD who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.” But he said, “O Lord GOD, how am I to know that I shall possess it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We call this cognitive dissonance. Abraham’s reality doesn’t match what he believes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can simultaneously believe and doubt, as with the father of the demon-possessed boy in Mark 9:24: Immediately, the father of the child cried out and said, “I believe; help my unbelief!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the overarching test for believers. We believe God is all-good and we believe that God is all powerful, yet evil exists. The martyred saints struggled with this in Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Abraham’s case, God will address Abraham’s desire to “know that I shall possess” with a covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-159-10&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:9-10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” And he brought him all these, cut them in half, and laid each half over against the other. But he did not cut the birds in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This procedure signifies a covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, both parties would divide the sacrifices and then walk between them – we’re going to see something different about this treaty in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cutting in half is symbolic of the curse on the one who violates the treaty. The parties are essentially saying, “may I become like this animal if I break the treaty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parties share a fellowship meal – symbolic of mutual blessings for keeping to the terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1511&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for the Eagle, birds of prey are usually negative in the Bible, as Jesus describes in the Parable of the Four Soils:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 13:4 And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 13:19 When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a direct sense, Abraham is going to have to compete with the enemies listed at the end of the chapter for possession of the land. They have no part in the covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an indirect sense, the birds are the ministers of Satan, ready to attack and defile God’s covenants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Driving the birds away means we need to be vigilant about identifying threats – something Abraham will fail to do in Chapter 16.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1512-14&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:12-14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. And behold, dreadful and great darkness fell upon him. Then the LORD said to Abram, “Know for certain that your offspring will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs and will be servants there, and they will be afflicted for four hundred years. But I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward, they shall come out with great possessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;terrible-darkness&#34;&gt;Terrible darkness?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tradition holds that Abraham was given a vision of all of the suffering of the Jewish people, from Egypt to Auschwitz, but it culminated with a vision of the Messianic Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another possibility Jesus was referencing when He said, “Abraham rejoiced to see My day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;unconditional-covenant&#34;&gt;Unconditional Covenant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many catholic and protestant commentators don’t understand the significance of verse 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common strain of theology goes like this: “Israel forfeited God’s promises because she rejected her Messiah. Those promises now belong to the church.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham was not an active party to the covenant trust agreement – this covenant was UNCONDITIONAL. Abraham, or his offspring Israel, could not violate the terms of the agreement if they tried, including the national rejection of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promises are still in play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church does not replace Israel; the church has an entirely different mission and destiny from national (theological) Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: this does not mean we have to blindly support political Israel – that is a different discussion although eventually theological Israel and political Israel must intersect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMHO we need to get away from blanketly saying this or that group is all good or all bad. There are Good Jews and bad Jews. There are good Palestinians and bad Palestianians. There are Good Christians and bad people who call themselves Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Job is to be bereans and true to the Bible, because of that I can say “my God and my Savior loves Israel so I love Israel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sojourner---messiah&#34;&gt;Sojourner - Messiah&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word is ger, and it refers to something like a resident alien – separated from his own people, living among foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messiah has been a sojourner, a stranger to His own people, living among us gentiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, Messiah will no longer be a sojourner or a stranger and He will inherit everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;400-years&#34;&gt;400 Years?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 7:6 And God spoke to this effect—that his offspring would be sojourners in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and afflict them four hundred years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know 400 years does not refer to the time they were in Egypt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further complicate matters, Exodus 12:40 says they were in Egypt 430 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at the genealogies, only 64 years pass from the time Joseph dies to when Moses is born – Exodus 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to one reckoning, the 400 years of affliction begins when Ishmael mocks/persecutes Isaac in Genesis 21. Then using the ages given in the Bible, it is exactly 400 years until Moses speaks to Pharaoh in Exodus 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30 years before this is when God Gave the promise to Abraham we are studying here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds contrived, Paul evidently confirms the math in Galatians 3 by saying the Torah was given 430 years after the promise to Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 3:16-17 Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, “And to offsprings,” referring to many, but referring to one, “And to your offspring,” who is Christ. This is what I mean: the law, which came 430 years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our presuppositions is that God’s word is infallible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we think we’ve found an error, we are revealing that we don’t really believe Scripture is without error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better to ask, “since the Bible cannot be in error, how is my understanding in error?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1515-16&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:15-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age. And they shall come back here in the fourth generation, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to remember God’s ways our not our ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In part, the reason the Israelites were in Egypt was so the sin of the Amorites would be complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the reason we go through trials is so we can later glorify God through our testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1517--the-torch-is-messiah&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:17 – The Torch is Messiah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the sun had gone down and it was dark, behold, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a foreshadowing of God as the pillar of cloud/pillar of fire in the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 62:1 For Zion&amp;rsquo;s sake I will not keep silent, and for Jerusalem&amp;rsquo;s sake I will not be quiet, until her righteousness goes forth as brightness, and her salvation (Yeshua) as a burning torch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1518-21&#34;&gt;Genesis 15:18-21&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that day, the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your offspring, I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates, the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exodus 12:40-43 The time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt was 430 years. [41] At the end of 430 years, &lt;strong&gt;on that very day,&lt;/strong&gt; all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt&amp;hellip;And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the statute of the Passover…,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to our 400/430 year discussion – if we take Exodus 12 literally, then the day Abraham received this vision was the evening between Nissan 14 and 15; in other words, he received it on Passover (in advance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14/15 Nissan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham slaughtered the animals to make a covenant with the LORD in a great and terrible darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children of Israel slaughtered their Passover lambs in Egypt as the angel of death slew Egypt’s firstborn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messiah suffered and died as our sacrifice, right after He instituted a New Covenant. At sunset, they closed the Master’s tomb (another great and terrible darkness).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all three darkness times a light blazed forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster, “The day of Passover draws a line of connection from Abraham’s covenant to his singular promised Seed, the Messiah.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;opening-thoughts&#34;&gt;Opening thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham has several decision points in this chapter. As we work through, ask yourself what would you have done if you were Abraham and why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, while an in-depth study of the various issues Paul addresses in Galatians is beyond our scope, Paul will use Hagar versus Sarah and Ishmael vs Isaac as typological models. The greater our understanding of Genesis chapters 16-21, the better we will be able to follow Paul’s rather complex arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:3.68616in;height:5.28283in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schlaegel, author of the Satellite Bible Atlas writes, “Despite the promises made in chapter 15, in chapter 16, we see what can happen when we get impatient with God.  Abram went into Hagar and she became pregnant.  This lead to strife between Sarai and Hagar and Hagar decides to flee.  God tells her that Ishmael will be blessed (though he will be a &amp;ldquo;wild ass of a man&amp;rdquo;) and she should return.  We aren&amp;rsquo;t told exactly where this happens but it is along the &amp;ldquo;Way of Shur&amp;rdquo;”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-161-2&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:1-2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Sarai, Abram&amp;rsquo;s wife, had borne him no children. She had a female Egyptian servant whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said to Abram, “Behold now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Go in to my servant; it may be that I shall obtain children by her.” And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A maidservant was a legal extension of her owner, so legally and technically, the result of the procedure Sarai suggested would have counted as Sarai’s offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Sarai’s defense, she probably felt like the one who was responsible for the unfulfilled promise and she was well past child-bearing age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going in to someone who is not your wife sounds odd to us but Sarai’s logic is no different than adoption, where two surrogate parents were involved with the conception or artificial insemination where one surrogate parent is involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a way to build a family with natural methods fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Sarai showed a lack of faith – it is God’s prerogative to open closed wombs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this method was a reasonable option in that day, In Abrahams&amp;rsquo;s case it is different because he was given a specific promise by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many poor choices, this one “seemed like a good idea at the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whose voice SHOULD Abraham have been listening to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we doubt God and act in the flesh, we “sire an Ishmael.” How many of us have a lot of little Ishmaels running around?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a socially acceptable arrangement in the Ancient world, but I’m reminded of the phrase, “just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, God calls us to a higher standard than the society around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; major test, according to Maimonides, a traditional Jewish commentator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the test was the long wait for the birth of a promised son, not being presented with Hagar (but we can see how impatience results in more tests, and often more opportunities to fail those tests).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want a child, and now look. My wife gives me option B.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing really well in chapters 13-15, Abraham blows it on multiple levels here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wish we could have a solid trend of growth, like a chart that consistently goes “up and to the right,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our lives resemble a stock chart more than a trend line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up and down; a good quarter, followed by a not-so-good quarter, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t help seeing some parallels between Sarai and Eve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text doesn’t say that Satan prompted Sarai, but it is safe to say the decision was not from God, and at least in an indirect sense, her decision was from the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God spoke through Adam and Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan spoke through Eve and Sarai (if only indirectly)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam listened to Eve, when He knew what God has said about the Tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham listened to Sarai when he knew what God had said about offspring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last two chapters, the Divine Narrator wants us to know the geographic origin of the two servants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that wherever Abraham goes, he accumulates more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Haran, it was Lot; in Damascus, it was Eliezer; and in Egypt, it was Hagar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wasn’t supposed to be in Haran&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was told to leave his father’s country and his family and head to a place God showed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lot was a repeated source of grief for Abram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was in Damascus because he was doing a righteous deed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was Lot’s kinsman redeemer and went after a lost sheep just like our Kinsman Redeemer pursued us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliezer of Damascus was a source of blessing for Abraham, which we will see in Genesis 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was not supposed to be in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God showed him Canaan, not Egypt; going to Egypt demonstrated a lack of faith in God’s promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He accumulated Hagar, who will be a source of grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hagar’s offspring and Sarah’s offspring have been clashing ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust-1&#34;&gt;Walking in His Dust #1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talmidim demonstrate patience and self-control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gal 5:22-23&lt;/em&gt; But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, when God has given us a promise, we wait on Him&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goals and aspirations are great things if they are consistent with God’s purposes for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to be content to wait for Him to bring those purposes to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is something God has placed on our heart, getting out in front of Him will only mess it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one sense, it’s natural to ask, “is there something I’m missing? Something I’m not doing that I should be doing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If God opens a door, then I’ll go through; but I’m learning to be content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is there may be open doors that God hasn’t opened – that was Abraham’s test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We must make sure we’re only moving out when He says “move out.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-163&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram&amp;rsquo;s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, and gave her to Abram, her husband, as a wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hagar, now a concubine, was not a full-status wife, so in the ancient world, this would not be viewed as polygamy.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years had passed since Abraham first heard from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and I get impatient when we don’t hear from God right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to wait on God, but can be disastrous when we don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this comes an ancient tradition that after a woman has gone childless for 10 years, her husband is obligated to marry another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-164&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, we have a negative connotation of “mistress,” so this phrasing is easy to misinterpret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s NOT that Sarah looking with contempt on Hagar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the other way around; Hagar’s mistress, i.e. superior, is Sarah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might say Hagar was taking a victory lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a cultural context, she may have equated herself as a wife of equal standing with Sarai, when she wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was in a lower social order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is the first recorded love triangle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this included a threat that Hagar was not going to give her son to Sarai as per the arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition tells us what Hagar said: She said, “This Sarai… her conduct in secret is not like her conduct in public. She shows herself as if she is a righteous woman, but she is not a righteous woman, for she did not merit to conceive all these years, whereas I have conceived from the first union.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (Genesis Rabbah 45:3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, with seemingly fanciful interpretations like these, our western mind wants to ask, “is this really true?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably not, but that’s not the point. Pastors use illustrations in sermons today; I’m sure every one is not 100% historically accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fill in gaps with educated guesses and speculations; Jewish commentary practices allow for a lot more creativitiy than our seminaries do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-165-6&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:5-6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong done to me be on you! I gave my servant to your embrace, and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked on me with contempt. May the LORD judge between you and me!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Abram said to Sarai, “Behold, your servant is in your power; do to her as you please.” Then Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to say, “this was YOUR idea, Sarai!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see two sides to Abram’s response&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. He failed to lead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible paints a picture at the very beginning of the book that the husband/father is supposed to be the “CEO” of the family organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam and Eve – Adam let his wife make a bad decision without consulting him. Did they not foster mutual accountability in Eden?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah led his family on to the ark, but he didn’t lead once they were off the ark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, Abraham deferred to Sarai’s judgment twice (verse 2 and here at verse 6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham is the one who had the discussion with God, not Sarah. He needed to be more of a leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. If Hagar was acting like she was a full status wife, Abram affirming that Hagar is still Sarai’s subordinate. So potentially, in deferring to Sarai he didn’t make a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps both are true. A good Berean attempts to see more than one side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a theme that will repeat in literature of the lower-status person having more than the upper-class person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole drama of the Count of Monte Cristo is based on this theme (and also a love triangle).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowly Hagar had more than wealthy Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, in God’s economy, the first shall be last and the last shall be first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible says, this time, Hagar left and not that she was cast out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust-2&#34;&gt;Walking in His Dust #2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We must speak out in defense of someone who is being mistreated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish medieval sage Rashi accuses Abram of stealing from Sarai here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How? After he heard Hagar disgrace Sarah, he was silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you prayed to God, “What will You give me, since I am going childless?” you prayed only for yourself, whereas you should have prayed for both of us, and I would have been remembered with you. Moreover, you are stealing from me your [protective] words, for you hear my degradation, and you remain silent (i.e., you are depriving me of the words you should have spoken to Hagar to reprimand her on my behalf)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pliskin says, “if failure to defend another person’s honor is stealing, then we are obligated to speak up when we see someone being disgraced. Word of defense are due to a person being disgraced, and it is consideres stealing to withhold them.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philippians 2:3-4 Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. [4] Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-167-8&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:7-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur. And he said, “Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?” She said, “I am fleeing from my mistress Sarai.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first mention of “The angel of the LORD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, the word for a supernatural angel is the same for a natural human messenger, but we can safely assume the Messenger of the Lord is definitely supernatural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some speculate that the angel of the LORD is pre-incarnate Jesus. There are places where this could be the case, but others where it doesn’t seem to fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the messenger is an authorized representative of the LORD, he can use the first person “I.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The messenger is at the same time distinct and not distinct from the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a government ambassador representing his king, or a corporal reading a message from a general, the messenger’s words carry the same weight as if they came from the LORD Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the lines become so blurry that it would appear that God Himself and not His angel is speaking. We’ll see this in Chapter 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Angel reinforces Hagar’s subordinate position with respect to Sarai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hagar answers the first question but cannot answer the second. She’s headed back to Egypt (the way to Shur tells us this), but spiritually she doesn’t know where she’s going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her chances of making it alone and pregnant (i.e. she would be viewed as a woman with suspect morals) probably weren’t good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s curious that God intervenes to prevent her from leaving the promised land, yet He did not do that – but could have – when Abram went to Egypt. This is God’s sovereign choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-169-11&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:9-11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angel of the LORD said to her, “Return to your mistress and submit to her.” The angel of the LORD also said to her, “I will surely multiply your offspring so that they cannot be numbered for multitude.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the angel of the LORD said to her, “Behold, you are pregnant and shall bear a son. You shall call his name Ishmael, because the LORD has listened to your affliction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yishma = he will hear, or he hears + El = God hears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone who has read Moby Dick will recall the iconic opening line “Call me Ishmael,” suggesting the narrator’s wild wandering and affliction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael is indeed a great multitude today; he is the Arabic people, many of whom were the first gentile believers in Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arabic Christians in the middle east are among the most persecuted today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jews don’t like them because they’re Arabs, and Muslims don’t like them because they’re Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Return and submit” is a tough assignment, given what Hagar has just experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1612&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He shall be a wild donkey of a man, his hand against everyone and everyone&amp;rsquo;s hand against him, and he shall dwell over against all his kinsmen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, a very dark prophecy for the Ishmaelites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Arabic (which became Islamic) tradition, Ishmael is regarded as the forefather of the Arab people and the rightful heir of Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael founded the holy city of Mecca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham nearly offered Ishmael, not Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lines of Ishmael and Isaac’s son Esau become comingled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he consolidated power, Muhammed is said to have eliminated many of his kinsman and today, Muhammed’s historical legacy is that the Suni’s hand is against the Shi’ia and vice versa. The main disagreement is over which group is the purer followers of Muhammed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is interesting is prior to the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, Jews and Muslims relations were not all that bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jews existed relatively comfortably in Islamic countries, including in the Ottoman empire. Egypt and Iran traditionally had thriving Jewish populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Israel/Palestine, Muslims generally venerated and protected Jewish holy sites such as tombs of the prophets and patriarchs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the Christian nations who were traditionally awful to the Jews with the inquisition, the pogroms, and of course the Holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After WWI, Britain and France began to muck around and redraw maps, and Jews began moving back into the Holy Land; that’s when Arab-Israeli conflicts began in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we need to be careful - this verse has been used to disparage all Arabs and Muslims. That’s called racism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our sin nature, ALL of our hands are against each other. We are only changed by the gift of a changed heart that comes through faith in Messiah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jer 17:9 “The heart is more deceitful than all else And is desperately sick; Who can understand it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen 6:5 Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of mankind was great on the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of their hearts was only evil continually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have disagreements with Islam, sure. Islam has many disagreements with Christianity (outside of the Dome of the Rock). Muslims, however are made in God’s image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1613-14&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:13-14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, “You are a God of seeing,” for she said, “Truly here I have seen him who looks after me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; it lies between Kadesh and Bered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hagar is likely stunned that she would merit such supernatural favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Roi (“row-ee” not “roy”) is God who Sees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrator uses God’s Covenant Name, but Hagar does not. Neither she nor the Ishmaelites are a party to God’s covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area is in the Negev in the wilderness. Moses and the Israelites likely passed the area on the way to Kadesh Barnea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1615-16&#34;&gt;Genesis 16:15-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;galatians-connection&#34;&gt;Galatians connection:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and one by a free woman. But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, while the son of the free woman was born through promise. Now this may be interpreted allegorically: these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar. Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children. But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother. For it is written, “Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear; break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor! For the children of the desolate one will be more than those of the one who has a husband.” Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise. But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now. But what does the Scripture say? “Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.” So, brothers, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman. Galatians 4:22-31&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Peter 3:15-16 And count the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him, as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul has a lot to say about being under the law in Galatians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter writes that people twist Paul “to their own destruction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this includes some commentators today who say Paul came to replace Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul himself identified as a Torah-observant Jew AFTER his Damascus Road experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Acts 21, people report that Paul is teaching others to forsake the law of Moses – these are FALSE accusations of Paul’s accusers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 21:39 and 22:3, “I AM a Jew (not “was”). 23:6: “I AM a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees” (not “was”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 23:9 – Pharisees pronounce Paul innocent – would they have done this if Paul had renounced Judaism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if teachers today teach that Paul forsook the Torah and renounced Judaism, is that teaching true or false?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue Paul is addressing in Galatians is the same issue many Christians struggle with: the grace of God seems too good to be true, so we feel we must somehow bring something to the table to justify ourselves. We call this “works-righteousness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the Israelites were freed from slavery and THEN they were given the Torah. We come to Jesus first, and then our lives, including our behavior and obedience, are transformed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Works-righteousness was and is a perversion of God’s gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of waiting for God’s promises Paul argues that typologically Abraham and Hagar represent works-righteousness, i.e. slavery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;misslers-conclusion&#34;&gt;Missler’s conclusion:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s servants are to trust His Word and to wait for its fulfillment, enduring patiently till the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes increasingly clear in Genesis that any person or any nation that owes its existence to divine election should live by faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human efforts will not help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the good news for God’s people is that the living God sees and hears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dont-sire-any-ishmaels&#34;&gt;Don’t sire any Ishmaels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one time about 25 years ago when email was still relatively new. While discussing something else, I happened to vent to my boss about someone in another department. I could have been less direct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the email chain got forwarded up to my Senior VP, who forwarded it to his Senior VP counterpart in the other department, and it got back to the person I said the not-nice things about. Of course I had no idea this had happened until…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weeks later, that person showed up in my office one day – mind you we didn’t work in the same building. He sought me out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was definitely a “wanna get away moment.” I did the whole “that’s not who I am or who I want to be” apology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was telling my then-pastor about it; he smiled he said, “Yep. When you typed the email, you sired an Ishmael.” At first, I said, “that’s not funny.” And then I said, “That’s a great phrase.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we act in the flesh instead of the Spirit we sire an Ishmael, a wild ass that is virtually uncontrollable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our greatest risk is our tongues – it’s why the Bible spends so much time trying to warn us about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish thought hits the topic hard – they call it “lashon hara” – the evil tongue and they associate biblical leprosy with Lashon hara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No specific geographic information is provided, but it’s reasonable to believe the meeting took place at the same site as one of their prior meetings. Therefore Beer Sheba is a good guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Genesis 17, God reaffirms His promise to Abraham, whose name God has recently changed. Abraham means “father of multitudes,” which at this point has to be considered a prophecy. As a sign of the covenant, God institutes circumcision. Sarai’s name is changed to Sarah, meaning “Princess.” God reiterates that Sarah will have a child in her old age. Abraham laughs, and God says the son’s name shall be Laughter “Yitzhak.” Abraham then circumcises himself, his son Ishmael, and the rest of his household (who probably weren’t laughing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-171-2-abraham-is-99-when-lord-appears-again&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:1-2: Abraham is 99 when LORD appears again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Now when Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, “I am God Almighty; Walk before Me, and be blameless. “I will make My covenant between Me and you, And I will multiply you exceedingly” (New American Standard Version).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first mention of God Almighty = El Shaddai&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Used 48x in OT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t exactly sure what “shaddai” means, but it has the sense of supplier, strength, protector, guardian, and sufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mezuzot and tefillin (phylacteries) have the Hebrew &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;שׁ&lt;/span&gt; for Shaddai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster: “He is sufficient to meet our needs. He is sufficient to carry us and sustain us, even through the long, dry spells when we do not necessarily feel His presence.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen years have passed between Genesis 16 and 17 and twenty-four years since Genesis 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, Abraham assumed Ishmael was the promised son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster sees a separate covenant from Genesis 15, one that “reaffirms all the same promises but increases their scope.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most other commentators would agree that the scope is increased but it’s the same covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster sees the following distinctions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Gen 15&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Gen 17&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Unconditional, Abram was asleep&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Abraham must live out his life with integrity and walk with God, submitting to His Authority.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A great nation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A multitude of nations (4)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Abundant seed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Kings come forth (6)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Land is a possession.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Canaan is an everlasting possession (8)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Name and mother of son not stated – Abraham assumed Ishmael&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sarah will have a son to be named Isaac (16, 20-21)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be hyperanalyzing the two covenants, but it’s interesting (I have three of his commentaries, and he only mentioned this in the oldest one; it’s entirely possible he’s since backed off of this viewpoint).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to walk before God and be blameless?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster writes, “Messianic Paul Leavertoff said, “If you want to know God, you must first have the certainty that He knows and loves you.” That’s the basis for a friendship, such as Abraham experienced with God.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-173-4-father-of-multitudes&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:3-4: Father of multitudes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying, “As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, And you will be the father of a multitude of nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A minor point perhaps, but it doesn’t say “our covenant” it says “My covenant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster’s view notwithstanding, it could be God is reiterating that the covenant is unilateral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is in response to chapter 16, where we might say Abraham tried to meet the terms of God’s covenant in Abraham&amp;rsquo;s own power apart from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton notes “no parallels in the ancient world to covenants between diety and mortal. Gods make demands and promise favor…but these fall far short of a covenant relationship initiated by diety for His own purposes.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-175-6-abram-to-abraham&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:5-6: Abram to Abraham&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No longer shall you be named Abram, But your name shall be Abraham; For I have made you the father of a multitude of nations. “I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham = father of multitudes. For a moment this must have seemed like a cruel joke. He was 99. Imagine the snickering when he told his men his new name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, the King of Kings will come from Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 1:1: The record of the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned, Romans 4 is Paul’s exposition on Genesis 15:6, “Abraham believed and it was credited to him as righteousness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul makes a reference to Genesis 17:5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 4:17-18 (as it is written: “I HAVE MADE YOU A FATHER OF MANY NATIONS”) in the presence of Him whom he believed, that is, God, who gives life to the dead and calls into being things that do not exist. [18] In hope against hope he believed, so that he might become a father of many nations according to that which had been spoken, “SO SHALL YOUR DESCENDANTS BE.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Abram to Abraham and Sarai to Sarah have the Hebrew letter &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ה&lt;/span&gt; added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some see the breath of God’s spirit as when God breathed life into Adam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word for love is pronounced ahav (&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אהב&lt;/span&gt;), which is adding a &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ה&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;אב&lt;/span&gt;, the word for “father.” The &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;ה&lt;/span&gt; thus represents love as the essence of the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, as with Adam, that which you name you have dominion over – God is establishing a special relationship with this couple by naming them personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God renamed Abram. God named Isaac prior to conception. God renamed Jacob as Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-177-8-you-and-your-descendants&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:7-8: you and your descendants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations as an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your descendants after you. “And I will give to you and to your descendants after you the land where you live as a stranger, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is the primary beneficiary of the covenant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary concluded her beautiful &lt;em&gt;Magnificat&lt;/em&gt; in Luke 1 with a reference to Genesis 17:7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Mary said: “My soul exalts the Lord, And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior. “For He has had regard for the humble state of His bond-servant; For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed. “For the Mighty One has done great things for me; And holy is His name. “And His mercy is to generation after generation Toward those who fear Him. “He has done mighty deeds with His arm; He has scattered those who were proud in the thoughts of their hearts. “He has brought down rulers from their thrones, And has exalted those who were humble. “He has filled the hungry with good things, And sent the rich away empty-handed. “He has given help to His servant Israel, In remembrance of His mercy, Just as He spoke to our fathers, To Abraham and his descendants forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zechariah similarly invoked Abraham in the famous &lt;em&gt;Benedictus&lt;/em&gt; Luke 1:68-75:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, For He has visited us and accomplished redemption for His people, And has raised up a horn of salvation for us In the house of His servant David— Just as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from ancient times— Salvation from our enemies, And from the hand of all who hate us; To show mercy to our fathers, And to remember His holy covenant, The oath which He swore to our father Abraham, To grant us that we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies, Would serve Him without fear, In holiness and righteousness before Him all our days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-179-11-circumcision&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:9-11: Circumcision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 God said further to Abraham, “Now as for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations. “This is My covenant, which you shall keep, between Me and you and your descendants after you: every male among you shall be circumcised. “And you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be the sign of the covenant between Me and you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s covenants are always associated with a sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah – rainbow; Abraham-circumcision; Moses-the Sabbath; David-a House (both in terms of a building and a royal bloodline); Jesus/New Covenant-Bread and Wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this covenant dealt with progeny and legacy, God selected the relevant part of the body for the covenant’s sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intent is that every time a son of Abraham engages in reproduction, they would be reminded not only of the covenant with Abraham but the individual’s role both as beneficiary and trustee in the covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circumcision was fairly common in the ancient near east, though as we shall see, over time it becomes associated with Abraham’s children and not the larger gentile world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton: “Circumcision can be seen as one of many cases where God transforms a common practice to a new purpose in revealing Himself and relating to his people.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Paul’s major points is that Genesis 15:6 comes before 17:10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, belief/faith comes first, followed by Obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 4:10-12: How then was (Abraham’s faith) credited? While he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? Not while circumcised, but while uncircumcised; and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while uncircumcised, so that he might be the father of all who believe without being circumcised, that righteousness might be credited to them, and the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also follow in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had while uncircumcised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1712-13-the-8supthsup-day&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:12-13: the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 “And every male among you who is eight days old shall be circumcised throughout your generations, including a slave who is born in the house or who is bought with money from any foreigner, who is not of your descendants. “A slave who is born in your house or who is bought with your money shall certainly be circumcised; so My covenant shall be in your flesh as an everlasting covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missler suggests that the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day is when Vitamin K and Prothrombin peak in the body at 110% of normal before stabilizing at normal levels, helping with healing and pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Christianity, we say that baptism is supposed to be an outward sign of an inward change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circumcision is sort of like this, though, for Jews at 8 days old, it is certainly it’s an outward sign of what is expected to be an inward change. The stock market might call it a forward-looking statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presumably, when the age of accountability is reached the boy would realize he’s under the covenant and act accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either case, the act is a sign of the covenant; in other words, it points to the covenant, it is not the covenant itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting circumcised doesn’t make one Jewish any more than getting baptized makes one a Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism doesn’t make you a Christian; you’re a Christian; therefore, you get baptized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Moses, Jeremiah, and Paul will dig into the theme of “circumcision of the heart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteronomy 30:6 “Moreover, the LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the hearts of your descendants, to love the LORD your God with all your heart and all your soul, so that you may live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah 9:26 Egypt, Judah, Edom, the sons of Ammon, Moab, and all those inhabiting the desert who trim the hair on their temples; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised of heart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 2:28-29 For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh. [29] But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter; and his praise is not from people, but from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circumcision of the Flesh reminds Jews that they’re under a unique covenant that requires circumcision of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water Baptism reminds a Christian that we’re under a unique covenant that requires Baptism of the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not that far apart – our procedure is less painful but their procedure probably better assures converts are committed to their new faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that “circumcision of the heart” does not replace physical circumcision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read verse 13 again. (Physical) circumcision is an “EVERLASTING” covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the various “sabbath controversies” in the Gospels, Jesus demonstrates that the things that He was doing were not violations of Shabbat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Jewish Messiah could not have violated the Sabbath and still claim to be the Jewish Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Sabbath act was related to bettering the human condition and alleviating suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ argument was that they were approved exceptions (even though those exceptions were not generally accepted in the Jewish community – He came to redefine/correct their view of the Sabbath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that regard, Jesus could have easily pointed to the command to circumcise on the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jewish practice, the circumcision (called a ‘bris’ in American and Europe) is performed on the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day even if the baby is born on a Friday (which presumably 14.2% of Jewish babies are).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The command is so important to furthering life (as represented by the original Covenant with Abraham) it supersedes Sabbath restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1714-uncircumcised-shall-be-cut-off&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:14: Uncircumcised shall be cut off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 “But as for an uncircumcised male, one who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that person shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One who refuses to get cut off shall be cut off (hard to miss the irony in that one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, the son of a Jewish father and a gentile mother is not Jewish and is not required to be circumcised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is different for a Jewish mother, whose male son was required to be circumcised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guideline was evidently in play in the first century as Paul had timothy circumcised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 16:1-3 Now Paul also came to Derbe and to Lystra. And a disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek … Paul wanted this man to leave with him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had ever wondered why Paul, who was typically so “anti-circumcision,” had Timothy circumcised, now you know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you got circumcised in a hospital, this was a worldly medical procedure; even though it probably has some health benefits, it is not the same as a covenant of circumcision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a previously circumcised gentile converts to Judiasm, a drop of blood from that area will be obtained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The covenant was a free gift (well, mostly free). Just as someone named in a will can refuse an inheritance, refusing to be circumcised means the person was opting out of God’s covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can a person lose his or her salvation? Probably not if the person falls away through deception or falling into some sin pattern, but is God going to force a person who once made a profession but later willfully opts out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1715-16-sarai-to-sarah&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:15-16: Sarai to Sarah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 Then God said to Abraham, “As for your wife Sarai, you shall not call her by the name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name. “I will bless her, and indeed I will give you a son by her. Then I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah means princess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Famous sons are often preceded by divine announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster tells of a Jewish fable that is curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As context, Sarai ends with the Hebrew letter yod (&lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;י&lt;/span&gt;); the yod was dropped and replaced with a hei to form Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the yod was lost from the end of Sarai’s name, it soared up to heaven to protest. “Is it because I am the smallest of all the letters that You have removed me from the name of righteous Sarai?” God replied, “Previously you were the last letter in a woman’s name. I am promoting you to the first letter in a man’s name.” For Moses renamed the son of Nun Yehoshua from Hoshea (Numbers 13:16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Followers of our Messiah raise an eyebrow at this story because in the first century, the name Yeshoshua had been abbreviated to Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster concludes, “the little letter yod had no further reason to complain about the change of Sarai’s name” as it is now associated with the Messiah.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1717&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:17&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17 Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, “Will a child be born to a man a hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, give birth to a child?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham assumed his descendants would come through Ishmael, whom Abraham loved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verb for laugh is Tzhak. Yitzhak is related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also means joking, mocking, sporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Genesis 26:8 Isaac is Tzhaking with Rebekkah (translated in NASB as caressing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Genesis 21:9 the son of Hagar is Tzahaking Isaac (translated in NASB as mocking), prompting Sarah to tell Abraham to drive out the slave woman and her son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul continues in Romans 4, with a reference to Abraham’s and Sarah’s old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 4:18-22: In hope against hope he believed, so that he might become a father of many nations according to that which had been spoken, “SO SHALL YOUR DESCENDANTS BE.” Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah’s womb; yet, with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in unbelief but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully assured that what God had promised, He was able also to perform. Therefore IT WAS ALSO CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1718-19&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:18-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Abraham said to God, “Oh that Ishmael might live before You!” But God said, “No, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you shall name him Isaac; and I will establish My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abraham loved Ishmael&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1720-22&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:20-22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 “As for Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I will bless him, and make him fruitful and multiply him exceedingly. He shall father twelve princes, and I will make him into a great nation. “But I will establish My covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this season next year.” When He finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1723-27&#34;&gt;Genesis 17:23-27&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abraham took his son Ishmael, and all the slaves who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s household, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin on this very same day, as God had said to him. Now Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. And his son Ishmael was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. On this very same day Abraham was circumcised, as well as his son Ishmael. And all the men of his household, those who were born in the house or bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham’s 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; test: to undergo such a painful ritual, Abraham had to have faith in the promise which had not yet materialized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have been stressing, his faith came first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of his faith he then changed his behavior to conform to God’s standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use our terminology, He didn’t get circumcised to get righteous with God; he got circumcised because by faith, he already was righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are saved by virtue of our faith, not by our ethnicity or whether we have undergone a ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle over circumcision in the Apostolic era was heated and complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We make it about “Law versus Grace,” but that is oversimplifying the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a side that reasonably believed that one had to be Jewish to follow a Jewish messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore Gentiles who came to faith should naturally wish to convert to Judaism and undergo circumcision in keeping with the expressed wishes of God in the Abrahamic covenant we just read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul agreed the commandment should continue to be required for Jewish people who come to faith in Messiah (as we saw with Timothy)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul and others cited verses in the Old Testament that said Gentiles would believe in Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Paul’s arguments is that if you required gentiles to convert to Judism, then they would henceforth be Jews not Gentiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are no gentiles, how can the OT passages regarding gentiles following Messiah be fulfilled?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, these adult believers would now be legally Jewish and required to keep the Torah, just the same as Jews who had been raised in Jewish homes and communities. The gentile converts would be at a severe disadvantage (see Galatians 5:3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a believer in Yeshua had the desire and discipline to begin the path to conversion to Judaism, that was great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A late first-century document called the Didache appears to state that such conversion could be a reasonable path for many mature disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be wrong to require such discipline from a brand-new gentile believer; it would be setting them up to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another of Paul’s arguments is that by requiring conversion to Judaism, the gentiles would have to earn their salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gentiles who believed this were trying to earn their way into heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our faith doesn’t work like that; what’s more, the Torah doesn’t teach that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still another of Paul’s arguments hinges upon the fact that Paul found Abraham’s new name significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just a “great nation” in Genesis 12 and 15, but now a multitude of goyim, gentile nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are sons of Abraham not by bloodline but by faith in Yeshua the perfect seed of Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul was not anti-Judaism; he was against the perversion of Judaism into a works-based religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m confident he would similarly be against 21st-century examples of works-based righteousness that are present in many Christian churches today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we say, be a Berean. Don’t take my word for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try reading Galatians with this assumption about Paul and see if it doesn’t make more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster: “Yeshua of Nazareth is the ultimate fulfillment of the Abrahamic promises. He is the promised Messiah, the Son of Abraham in whom all nations will be blessed. As children of Abraham, we share in his firm hope, his faith in God, and the promised Seed of Abraham. He is the father of all who believe.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-181-2&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:1-2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the LORD appeared to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre while he was sitting at the tent door in the heat of the day. When he raised his eyes and looked, behold, three men were standing opposite him; and when he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed down to the ground,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tents were designed to hold in heat at night but flaps can open to allow breezes during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham does not yet know that these three are supernatural, and we aren’t told when he realizes that they aren’t. Without any fanfare, all of a sudden, he knows he’s talking to the LORD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-183-5&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:3-5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and said, “My Lord, if now I have found favor in Your sight, please do not pass Your servant by. “Please let a little water be brought and wash your feet, and make yourselves comfortable under the tree, and I will bring a piece of bread so that you may refresh yourselves; after that, you may go on since you have visited your servant.” And they said, “So do as you have said.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the standards of the day, Abraham was required to do this, but he went above and beyond, as we shall see in the next passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospitality may have had a pragmatic goal – you never knew when someone approaching could be an enemy. Here was a chance to potentially transform an enemy into a friend, at least temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washing the feet of guests was a standard act of hospitality, given the often dry and dusty roads of the ancient near east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often a bowl was placed by the door and the guest washed their own feet – this appears to be what Abraham offers here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some commentators will note that feet washing was so nasty, typically only the lowest servant could be assigned to wash another’s feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this makes Jesus’ act at the Last Supper all the more remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust&#34;&gt;Walking in His Dust&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 13:2 Do not neglect hospitality to strangers, for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We typically think of entertaining and hospitality as something like a fellowship meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it includes that, more broadly, hospitality includes any act of aid and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of the Good Samaritan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospitality is loving your neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice again God’s ways vs the World’s ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world says look out for #1, never deny our own desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entertaining is OK as long as you get something out of it (showing off the fact that you have the means to host a big party, or maybe cultivate a new business contact).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God says to give selflessly to help others who may never be able to repay you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter elaborates on this: “Above all, keep loving one another earnestly since love covers a multitude of sins. Show hospitality to one another without grumbling. As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God&amp;rsquo;s varied grace: whoever speaks, as one who speaks oracles of God; whoever serves, as one who serves by the strength that God supplies—in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. (1 Peter 4:8-11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-186-8&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:6-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, “Quickly, prepare three measures of fine flour, knead it, and make bread cakes.” Abraham also ran to the herd and took a tender and choice calf and gave it to the servant, and he hurried to prepare it. He took curds and milk and the calf which he had prepared and set it before them, and he was standing by them under the tree as they ate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham was not obligated to prepare a calf; yogurt and bread would have been sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A measure is a seah, which is about 20 quarts. This was a banquet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more onerous of the Jewish dietary restrictions is that one cannot mix dairy and meat; this is curious as right here, Abraham is doing just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In restaurants, there are designated dairy and non-dairy sections; even if your meal doesn’t have any dairy, you are not allowed to sit in the dairy section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restriction comes from Exodus 23:19, which only says, “you are not to boil a young goat in the milk of its mother.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tree is venerated in Hebron today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-189-12&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:9-12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they said to him, “Where is your wife, Sarah?” And he said, “There, in the tent.” He said, “I will certainly return to you at this time next year; and behold, your wife Sarah will have a son.” And Sarah was listening at the tent door, which was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; Sarah was past childbearing. So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, “After I have become old, am I to have pleasure, my lord being old also?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah was in the tent, likely because the tradition was women did not eat with men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1813-16&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:13-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the LORD said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ‘Shall I actually give birth to a child when I am so old?’ “Is anything too difficult for the LORD? At the appointed time, I will return to you, at this time next year, and Sarah will have a son.” Sarah denied it, however, saying, “I did not laugh”; for she was afraid. And He said, “No, but you did laugh.” Then the men rose up from there and looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham was walking with them to send them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without any prior notice, we now learn that the LORD is among the visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have to piece things together but since three men showed up initially and we learn that only two will be in Sodom and those two are angels, the makeup of the three visitors is most likely (allowing for other permutations) the LORD (possibly in the form of pre-incarnate Jesus) and two mighty angels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We note that both Abraham and Sarah laughed but only Sarah was chided for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, it might not be the crime but the cover-up that got her in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard to top the KJV here “Nay, but thou didst laugh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the word for laugh is Tzahaq which is linguistically related to Ytzhaq, Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1817-19&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:17-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do, since Abraham will certainly become a great and mighty nation, and in him, all the nations of the earth will be blessed? “For I have chosen him, so that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing righteousness and justice, so that the LORD may bring upon Abraham what He has spoken about him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham’s grandfather and Shem were alive at the same time; no doubt the story of the Flood was still “fresh” in everyone’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potentially Abraham would see the destruction of Sodom and think the world is ending in judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God averts that by reassuring him this is only a local judgment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1820-22&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:20-22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the LORD said, “The outcry of Sodom and Gomorrah is indeed great, and their sin is exceedingly grave. “I will go down now and see whether they have done entirely as the outcry, which has come to Me indicates; and if not, I will know.” Then the men turned away from there and went toward Sodom while Abraham was still standing before the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our just God is investigating the situation before issuing the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of Genesis 19, with the men banging on the door, was the trial&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 13 will be the verdict “The Lord has sent us to destroy it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hailfire was the penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1823-33&#34;&gt;Genesis 18:23-33&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham approached and said, “Will You indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked? “Suppose there are fifty righteous people within the city; will You indeed sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Far be it from You to do such a thing, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike. Far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth deal justly?” So the LORD said, “If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the entire place on their account.” And Abraham replied, “Now behold, I have ventured to speak to the Lord, although I am only dust and ashes. “Suppose the fifty righteous are lacking five; will You destroy the entire city because of five?” And He said, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he spoke to Him yet again and said, “Suppose forty are found there?” And He said, “I will not do it on account of the forty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he said, “Oh, may the Lord not be angry, and I shall speak; suppose thirty are found there?” And He said, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he said, “Now behold, I have ventured to speak to the Lord; suppose twenty are found there?” And He said, “I will not destroy it on account of the twenty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he said, “Oh, may the Lord not be angry, and I shall speak only this once: suppose ten are found there?” And He said, “I will not destroy it on account of the ten.” As soon as He had finished speaking to Abraham the LORD departed, and Abraham returned to his place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middle eastern haggling is a well-earned stereotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice is not served by ignoring wickedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had there been higher numbers of righteous, the city might have been spared only if they could have exerted a reforming influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, there will not even be 10 righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-191-3&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:1-3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the two angels came to Sodom in the evening as Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he stood up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he said, “Now behold, my lords, please turn aside into your servant’s house, and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may rise early and go on your way.” They said, “No, but we shall spend the night in the public square.” Yet he strongly urged them, so they turned aside to him and entered his house; and he prepared a feast for them and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downward progression of Lot. Now he’s sitting at the gate, which is equivalent to being on the city council or chamber of commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unleavened bread here because they arrived in the evening and there was not time for the bread to rise prior to baking. When they arrived at Hebron it was the middle of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our Gospels study, we noted that John 3 took place at night and John four took place during the day (Jesus moves us from darkness to light).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here Genesis 18 takes place during the day and most of Genesis 19 talkes place at night (sin such as Sodom moves us from light to darkness)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of hospitality is that the host is responsible for the safety and well-being of his guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lot will take this extremely seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-194-5&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:4-5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before they lay down, the men of the city—the men of Sodom—surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter; and they called to Lot and said to him, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may have relations with them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-196-9&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:6-9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Lot went out to them at the doorway, and shut the door behind him,and said, “Please, my brothers, do not act wickedly. “Now look, I have two daughters who have not had relations with any man; please let me bring them out to you, and do to them whatever you like; only do not do anything to these men, because they have come under the shelter of my roof.” But they said, “Get out of the way!” They also said, “This one came in as a foreigner, and already he is acting like a judge; now we will treat you worse than them!” So they pressed hard against Lot and moved forward to break the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1910-13&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:10-13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them, and shut the door. Then they struck the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness, from the small to the great, so that they became weary of trying to find the doorway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the two men said to Lot, “Whom else do you have here? A son-in-law and your sons and daughters, and whomever you have in the city, bring them out of the place;for we are about to destroy this place, because their outcry has become so great before the LORD that the LORD has sent us to destroy it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1914&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, and said, “Up, get out of this place, for the LORD is destroying the city.” But he appeared to his sons-in-law to be joking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1915-17&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:15-17&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Up, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city.” But he hesitated. So the men grasped his hand and the hand of his wife and the hands of his two daughters, because the compassion of the LORD was upon him; and they brought him out and put him outside the city. When they had brought them outside, one said, “Escape for your life! Do not look behind you, and do not stay anywhere in the surrounding area; escape to the mountains, or you will be swept away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1918-19&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:18-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Lot said to them, “Oh no, my lords! “Now behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your compassion, which you have shown me by saving my life; but I cannot escape to the mountains, for the disaster will overtake me and I will die;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1920-22&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:20-22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 now behold, this town is near enough to flee to, and it is small. Please, let me escape there (is it not small?) so that my life may be saved.” And he said to him, “Behold, I grant you this request also, not to overthrow the town of which you have spoken. “Hurry, escape there, for I cannot do anything until you arrive there.” Therefore the town was named Zoar. The sun had risen over the earth when Lot came to Zoar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1924-26&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:24-26&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD rained brimstone and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah from the LORD out of heaven, and He overthrew those cities, and all the surrounding area, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground. But Lot’s wife, from behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1927-28&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:27-28&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Abraham got up early in the morning and went to the place where he had stood before the LORD; and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the surrounding area; and behold, he saw the smoke of the land ascended like the smoke of a furnace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1929-30&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:29-30&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it came about, when God destroyed the cities of the surrounding area, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the destruction, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot had lived. Now Lot went up from Zoar with his two daughters and stayed in the mountains, because he was afraid to stay in Zoar; and he stayed in a cave, he and his two daughters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1931-35&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:31-35&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to have relations with us according to the custom of all the earth. “Come, let’s make our father drink wine, and let’s sleep with him so that we may keep our family alive through our father.” So they made their father drink wine that night, and the firstborn went in and slept with her father; and he did not know when she lay down or got up. On the following day, the firstborn said to the younger, “Look, I slept last night with my father; let’s make him drink wine tonight too, then you go in and sleep with him, so that we may keep our family alive through our father.” So they had their father drink wine that night too, and the younger got up and slept with him; and he did not know when she lay down or got up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-1936-38&#34;&gt;Genesis 19:36-38&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so both of the daughters of Lot conceived by their father. The firstborn gave birth to a son, and named him Moab; he is the father of the Moabites to this day. As for the younger, she also gave birth to a son, and named him Ben-ammi; he is the father of the sons of Ammon to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;images/media/image1.png&#34; style=&#34;width:6.5in;height:5.92361in&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These episodes take place primarily in Gerar and Beersheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham relocates to Gerar, a pagan kingdom (blue arrow towards Gerar) where he has another lack of faith (he didn&amp;rsquo;t learn the lesson from Egypt) in which he tells a 1/2 truth that Sarah was his sister.  God intervened again to preserve the purity of his promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac, the son of the Promise (Gal 4:23-26) is born possibly at Gerar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 21, Abraham makes a treaty with the king of Gerar at Beersheva - well of seven/oath&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-201&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there Abraham journeyed toward the territory of the Negeb and lived between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason we don’t have many archeological remains from this period is the nomadic lifestyle. People like Abraham moved somewhere, then moved on, often being deliberate about not leaving a trace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all Hebrew words have the accent on the last syllable. One exception is certain two syllable word that have a short e vowel. So the word for desert is not pronounced nuh-GEV, but NEH-gev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerar is possibly a region, not a specific city, but many archeologists point to this location about 15 miles northwest of Beersheva as the likely location.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kadesh, or Kadesh Barnea, will become a pivotal location later in the Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is here that the 12 spies returned. When the 10 brought back a bad report and spread fear through the camp, a riot ensued. As punishment, God sentenced the people to wander in the wilderness for 38 more years (a total of 40), while that generation died off, except for the two spies who brought back a good report: Joshua and Caleb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-202&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oy vey!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the eighth test of Abraham, according to the sages. He doesn’t do so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sometimes face the same challenges repeatedly because we keep getting them wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever blind spot Abraham has in his faith, he, unfortunately, passes it down to Isaac, who will pull the same ruse with Rebekah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 99-year-old woman was desirable. She must have been extremely beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abimelech comes from two Hebrew words, Avi – my father and Melech – king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is probably a title, “my father the king” (like a “lord and master” title in medieval times) versus a given name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-203-5&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:3-5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man&amp;rsquo;s wife.” Now Abimelech had not approached her. So he said, “Lord, will you kill an innocent people? Did he not himself say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In one of the many mysteries of God, He periodically makes Himself known to non-Israelites. He also does this with Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar. Even more puzzling is that none of the three are recorded as putting their faith in the God of Abraham despite the divine encounter. Nebuchadnezzar comes closest in Daniel 4, but there is little historical evidence that he had a major change of heart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-206-8&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:6-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her. Now then, return the man&amp;rsquo;s wife, for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you, and you shall live. But if you do not return her, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours.” So Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things. And the men were very much afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling Abraham a “prophet” might have been a term that Abimelech understood to mean Abraham had a unique relationship with his God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham was not necessarily a giver of prophecy the way we think of the term (as it relates to Elijah, Isaiah, and so forth).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prophecy is not limited to the prediction and fulfillment of future events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prophet is someone who speaks the words of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pragmatically, Abimelech also would have understood that as a prophet, Abraham had the ability to bless Abimelech, which in his mind would have equated to material blessings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-209-10&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:9-10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done.” And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you see, that you did this thing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s not wrong. Abraham blew his witness here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the way the KJV words 2 Sam 12:14. 2 Samuel 12:14 (KJV) by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is when Nathan confronts David over his sin with Bathsheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the other translations say something to the effect of “because you have disrespected the Lord.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KJV focuses on the end result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we mess up publicly we misrepresent God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re supposed to be God’s ambassadors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our character represents His character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You didn’t just disrespect the Lord, which is bad enough. Your behavior reflected so poorly on your king that they blasphemed Him.” Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did you see? I love that choice of words. We have a natural tendency to literally or figuratively see things that aren’t real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learn from verse 17 that there was a plague of barrenness upon Abimelech’s house because of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, some time would have needed to elapse before making the conclusion that they were afflicted with barrenness, yet this all apparently happened on the night Abimelech took Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would they know this was a plague from God in one night?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s just say one speculation is that Abimelech and his men needed to ask their doctor whether a particular class of medication was right for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another might be that those about to give birth were prevented from doing so; including hens unable to lay eggs according to the Talmud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, the text is clear that nothing happened between Sarah and Abimelech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To underscore this and dispel any notion that Abimelech was the father of Isaac, Jewish tradition holds that Isaac’s physical appearance was in all respects identical to Abraham&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, mocking traditions would later arise that Abimelech was the father of Isaac, just as mocking traditions arose that Jesus had a natural biologic father, whether by Joseph or a Roman soldier named Pantera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac foreshadows Jesus in many ways, the greatest of which we will see next time in Genesis 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2011-13&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:11-13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham said, “I did it because I thought, ‘There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’ Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife. And when God caused me to wander from my father&amp;rsquo;s house, I said to her, ‘This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seemed like a good idea at the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His assessment was incorrect. There WAS a fear of God in that place and Abimelech respected the boundaries of marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get into trouble when we draw unsolicited conclusions about another’s spiritual status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck Missler used to say “don’t draw vast conclusions from half-vast data.” (Let me know when you get the pun.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is much better to give our neighbors the benefit of the doubt unless/until proven otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another “sire an Ishmael” moment, though God spared Abraham any negative consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A half-truth with an intent to deceive is a full lie. In the same way, spreading an embarrassing fact about someone else with the intent to hurt that person is gossip and slander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see that Abraham devised this con before coming to the promised land. When we come to God, we need to cleanse out our old ways. For some of us, a lifetime is not enough, but we still try to live a God-honoring life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible does not hide the flaws of its leaders. It is possible to be a man or woman who is used mightily by God yet still flawed. That should give us encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2014-16&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:14-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him. And Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you.” To Sarah, he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is a sign of your innocence in the eyes of all who are with you, and before everyone, you are vindicated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1000 shekels is about 25 pounds of silver, more than a worker could expect to make in a lifetime.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s Abimelech’s guarantee that Sarah was untouched and an appeasement to the prophet of the deity who cursed Abimelech’s household with barrenness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it’s not a gift, it’s a transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham upholds his end of the contract in verse 17 and God is appeased in verse 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to give Abimelech due credit here – even though he did not wrong Abraham with prior knowledge or intent; he still makes it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-his-dust-talmidim-way-insight&#34;&gt;In His Dust Talmidim Way Insight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have wronged someone, we are obligated to ask for forgiveness.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages teach that even though Abimelech made financial restitution, his full atonement came when he asked Abraham to intercede with prayer to God. Abimelech would have had to ask Abraham for this, so it follows that Abimelech had to ask Abraham for forgiveness for any anguish he caused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Forgive others, that God may forgive you” (e.g., Mat 6:14-15) is not exclusively a New Testament idea; it is well attested to in the Talmud. It’s a Jewish concept that our Jewish Messiah teaches us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought is not that God’s forgiveness is conditional; it is unconditional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought is, how can we call ourselves &lt;em&gt;talmidim&lt;/em&gt; if we ask God for forgiveness but refuse to forgive others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the important aspects of Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, is seeking forgiveness for the sins we did not even know we committed. I wish Christianity had a day like that. An entire day devoted to getting right with God and our neighbors. Sign me up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ephesians 4:32 Be kind to one another, compassionate, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2017-18&#34;&gt;Genesis 20:17-18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children. For the LORD had closed all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham&amp;rsquo;s wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham’s intercession brings immediate spiritual and physical relief; even though up to this point, Abraham’s prayers for he and Sarah to have a child have remained unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is because Abraham prayed for others that allowed God to bless Abraham and Sarah with Isaac. What’s holding you back from praying for others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrative Abraham and Abimelech continues in Genesis 21:22&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orange arrow from Gerar (box 6) towards Egypt marks the expulsion of Ishmael and Hagar into the wilderness of Beersheba&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separation was necessary to protect the son of the promise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red arrow from Beersheba to Jerusalem (box 7) denotes the path to and from the offering of Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Map credit&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-21-and-romans-galatians-and-hebrews&#34;&gt;Genesis 21 and Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An understanding of Genesis 21 is paramount to understanding Paul’s/Hebrew’s arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews and only these three New Testament books discuss Genesis 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acts references the birth of Isaac; James and Hebrews reference the sacrifice of Isaac in Genesis 22.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to read Galatians and come away that Paul was somehow anti-law or anti-Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This train of thought is deeply flawed and runs the risk of missing Paul’s points entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is focused not on Judaism as a whole, but on the Messiah-rejecting Jews who are knowingly or unknowingly continuing in legalism instead of accepting the free gift the Messiah brings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, the three books, and only these three New Testament books quote Habakkuk 2:4 (KJV) “but the just shall live by his faith.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews seem to form a trilogy on Habakkuk 2:4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme of Romans: who are the justified?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme of Galatians: how shall the justified live?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme of Hebrews: faith in the promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads many to suspect Paul is the author of Hebrews. If he did not, this is an even greater miracle, because whoever wrote Hebrews unknowingly completed the trilogy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-211-3&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:1-3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD took note of Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for Sarah as He had promised. So Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him. Abraham named his son who was born to him, the son whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:23 But the son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, and the son by the free woman through the promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:11 By faith even Sarah herself received the ability to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other translations say “God remembered Sarah.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not that God forgot, but that He remembered His promise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Appointed time” = &lt;em&gt;mo’ed.&lt;/em&gt; The Jewish festivals are Moedim. Shabbat is a moed. A moed is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Isaac was born on a festival day, just as some speculate Jesus might have been born on Yom Kippur or the first day of Tabernacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either day fits – He is our atonement and he dwells/tabernacles among us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Bible uses a miraculous birth to indicate that God has set aside that child for some great purpose.” (SOM 94)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yitzhak is related to the Hebrew verb &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;צחק&lt;/span&gt;, which means to laugh, but often carries a nuanced connotation of mocking/scorning or even sexual play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’ll unpack more at verse 9.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-214-7&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:4-7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. Now Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me.” And she said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have given birth to a son in his old age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically, in an age of high infant mortality rates, eight days, an infant was considered viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac was circumcised according to the letter of the law on the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is contrasted with Ishmael, who was circumcised at age 13; he was still circumcised, but in a typological sense, not when he “should” have been according to the Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the nuanced meaning of Tzahaq, this may not necessarily be laughing in joy, but laughing in amazement. Sarah and Abraham both laughed in disbelief and perhaps mockery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac’s birth was a true miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an overarching theme in the Bible of God miraculously opening a closed womb. This extends to Mary; although she was not barren in the traditional sense, her womb was miraculously opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God made EVERYTHING in Sarah come to life – she didn’t just give birth but was able to nurse for a couple of years after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-218-10&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:8-10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. Now Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking Isaac. Therefore she said to Abraham, “Drive out this slave woman and her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not be an heir with my son Isaac!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode becomes symbolic of the affliction of the Hebrew/Jewish people throughout the ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:29 But as at that time the son who was born according to the flesh persecuted the one who was born according to the Spirit, so it is even now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:31 So then, brothers and sisters, we are not children of a slave woman, but of the free woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to some reckonings, the 400 years of suffering and affliction culminating in the exodus from Egypt begins with this affliction of Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t have much background on any tradition of a weaning feast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know who Hagar is, but the Narrator wants us to remember her as “Hagar the Egyptian.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did Ishmael do that was so bad that he and his mother had to be driven out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s this word Tzahaq again, translated as mocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Laughter can be used for good or for ill.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:8 Now it came about, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked down through a window, and saw them, and behold, Isaac was &lt;strong&gt;caressing&lt;/strong&gt; his wife Rebekah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caressing = sporting = “Tzahaqing”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael ridiculing and poking fun at his younger brother probably wouldn’t have led to the banishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael was quite possibly a sexual predator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah refuses to speak his name. Whatever it was, it had to be bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust-along-the-talmidim-way&#34;&gt;Walking In His Dust Along The Talmidim Way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;talmidim-must-drive-out-fleshly-works-and-sin-from-our-lives&#34;&gt;Talmidim must drive out fleshly works and sin from our lives.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 5:7 Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, just as you are in fact unleavened. For Christ our Passover also has been sacrificed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another theme in the Bible is the firstborn son doing something to forfeit his inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, the firstborn son receives a double portion of the father’s estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the son does something wicked, he forfeits his promise; then the next in line receives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Ishmael but Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Esau but Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Reuben (and not Simeon or Levi) but Judah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we have an especially odd situation. Joseph was the firstborn of Jacob’s favorite wife Rebekkah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judah receives the official double portion, but Joseph also receives a double portion with Ephraim and Manaesseh being adopted by Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2111-13&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:11-13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matter distressed Abraham greatly because of his son Ishmael. But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed because of the boy and your slave woman; whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her, for through Isaac your descendants shall be named. “And of the son of the slave woman I will make a nation also, because he is your descendant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:28 And you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 9:7 nor are they all children because they are Abraham’s descendants, but: “THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS SHALL BE NAMED.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:18 it was he to whom it was said, “THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS SHALL BE NAMED.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banishment of Ishmael is Abraham’s 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see here that he was reluctant and was “distressed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He loved Ishmael.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His specific tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did he trust God to take care of him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did he trust God’s promises to make Ismael a great nation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did he trust Sarah’s judgment after the last time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial of Ishmael prepared him for the final test in Genesis 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God had previously promised a great future for Ishmael, but Isaac is the one who will inherit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s curious that the Narrator added, “whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her…”. Certainly, this was not the case in Genesis 16 or Genesis 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genesis 3:17 Then to Adam He said, “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat from it’; Cursed is the ground because of you; With hard labor you shall eat from it All the days of your life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2114-16&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:14-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Abraham got up early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water, and gave them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder, and gave her the boy, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered about in the wilderness of Beersheba. When the water in the skin was used up, she left the boy under one of the bushes. Then she went and sat down opposite him, about a bowshot away, for she said, “May I not see the boy die!” And she sat opposite him, and raised her voice and wept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:24 This is speaking allegorically, for these women are two covenants: one coming from Mount Sinai giving birth to children who are to be slaves; she is Hagar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:31 So then, brothers and sisters, we are not children of a slave woman, but of the free woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern makes an interesting comment at Galatians 4:24, “Nowhere does the account in Genesis denigrate Hagar, hense there is no reason to demean the Mosaic Law on the basis of this passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the Torah or Judaism, but people who have perverted the Torah and Judaism into a legalistic system, which is equivalent to a return to slavery in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is essentially the same territory where she wandered in chapter 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned in Israel that in Abraham’s day, towns were generally situated about a day’s journey apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He outfitted her with one day’s provisions with the expectation that she would “refuel” at the next town, perhaps Beersheba 15 miles from Gerar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, she doesn’t make it and heads into the wilderness/desert south of Beersheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did she make it but was turned away because of her “status”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could she not make it that far?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps distressed, did she meander aimlessly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2117-19&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:17-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God heard the boy crying; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What is the matter with you, Hagar? Do not fear, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. “Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him by the hand, for I will make a great nation of him.” Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another significant well moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as in chapter 16, God again sees Hagar and provides materially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also reiterates His promises that Hagar had forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well was there; she just couldn’t see it. That’s a picture of us some days. We can’t open our eyes enough to see the blessing before us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Romans and Galatians, many of us have a dim view of Hagar and Ishmael – certainly, some of this is deserved and as biblical types, they represent the things that we are supposed to reject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s remember the Bible’s worst sinners are pictures of you and me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael messed up “bigly.” We mess up too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here God reaches out and offers both Hagar and Ishmael His mercy and protection. We can be critical because it doesn’t appear that this mercy had any lasting effect. One would have hoped that they could have followed the God of Abraham. We have the same choices when God shows us mercy. How often does God bail us out or see us through a tough spot only to have us forget about God a few moments later?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust-along-the-talmidim-way-1&#34;&gt;Walking In His Dust Along The Talmidim Way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;when-things-seem-hopeless-talmidim-look-for-gods-promises&#34;&gt;When things seem hopeless, talmidim look for God’s promises.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes life hits us and we lose focus. When things seem bleak and we despair, we may need to open our eyes to the goodness of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Peter 3:14-15 But even if you should suffer for righteousness&amp;rsquo; sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2120-21&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:20-21&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God was with the boy, and he grew; and he lived in the wilderness and became an archer. He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paran is in the northeastern Sinai desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This region figures prominently in the Wilderness wanderings (specifically Numbers 13, where Kadesh-Barnea is located).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2122-24&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:22-24&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, “God is with you in all that you do. Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my descendants or with my posterity, but as I have dealt kindly with you, so you will deal with me and with the land where you have sojourned.” And Abraham said, “I will swear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a great testimony. I hope it can someday be said of me “God is with you in all that you do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, God is with me in all that I do; but I don’t always live my life in a way that others recognize it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Abraham’s duplicity, his relationship with Abimelech blossoms into a fruitful and symbiotic partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oaths are legally binding – this is more than a handshake agreement between friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2125&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:25&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Abraham reproved Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech&amp;rsquo;s servants had seized, Abimelech said, “I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it until today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a contract, one party has the right to notify the other if there is a potential material breach. Abraham is doing that here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beersheba is at the northern edge of the Negev desert. Even today, south of Beersheba is sparsely populated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not much water, so what little water there is becomes a hot commodity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our tour guide’s wife is a hydrologist for the nation of Israel – even today, providing enough water for the population is of paramount interest. In the last ten years, the primary water source has shifted from the Jordan River and the Sea of Galilee to desalinated seawater from the Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-his-dust-talmidim-way-insight&#34;&gt;In His Dust Talmidim Way Insight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you reprove someone who has wronged you, have the good in mind.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can learn from Abraham’s admonishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham was not angry, nor seeking to get even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He confronted Abimelech with the goal of restoring their relationship; a relationship Abimelech didn’t even know was injured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge of a leader is that you can’t know everything, but it’s your job to know everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham is reminding Abimelech that it was his job to know that his men were behaving dishonestly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 18:15 “Now if your brother sins, go and show him his fault in private; if he listens to you, you have gained your brother.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to rebuke someone; do it one on one and ideally in person; not on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps an associated insight is we need to &lt;em&gt;receive bad news as an improvement opportunity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can take the position that Abraham’s goal was not to tattle but to build Abimelech up as a leader. This is of course in addition to remedying the immediate situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior executive I worked with paraphrased the famous line from the Godfather, “I want to hear good news right away and bad news immediately.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fostering that kind of culture in an organization takes time but it is critical in our families and ministries as well as our businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the other person is not bringing the criticism forward in a spirit of edification, if the substance of the criticism has merit, we can still learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 3:19 ‘Those whom I love, I rebuke and discipline; therefore be zealous and repent.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2127-28&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:27-28&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant. Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than when it involves Sarah, Abraham is highly skilled as a negotiator and at resolving conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I take comfort in this – I was generally successful as a business executive and viewed as a capable and effective leader; yet I often struggle with leading my own family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheva literally means “seven”; because of this episode, it also comes to mean “oath.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2129-31&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:29-31&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?” He said, “These seven ewe lambs you will take from my hand, that this may be a witness for me that I dug this well.” Therefore that place was called Beersheba, because there both of them swore an oath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells turnout to be extremely significant in scripture. In John 4, Jacob’s well plays a prominent supporting role in the story of Jesus and the Samaritan woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beersheba means literally “well of the seven” but denotatively, “well of the oath.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2132&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:32&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army rose up and returned to the land of the Philistines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit anachronistic as there were not yet Philistines in the coastal plain areas. Egyptians and Canaanites, yes; Philistines, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrator clarifies the geographic location for a later audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first mention of the Philistines in history is around 1180 BC; we believe Abraham lived around 2000 or 1900 BC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s similar to referring to “native Americans” who were around these lands long before the term “America” was used as a geographic label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2133-34&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:33-34&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God. And Abraham sojourned many days in the land of the Philistines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tamarisk is a good tree for the desert. It grows in sandy soil and provides ample shade and food for herbivores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Israel, we learned that “conquering the land” is not always a military campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planting trees, literal and figurative roots in the land, is another way Abraham conquered the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Zionists started to move back around the turn of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, much of the northern part of the country was a swamp. They imported Eucalyptus trees from Australia which sucked up all the water. The land is fertile once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Israel boasts that it plants more trees than it harvests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everlasting in Hebrew is “olam”; it can also mean “world” or “universe”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost all Jewish blessings start with “Baruch ata Adonai Eloheinu, Melech haOlam,” Blessed are you Lord our God, King of the Universe.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we have tension and conflict, we should certainly seek God’s council for relief and godly wisdom on handling the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just don’t forget to call on His name after He delivers you from the test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orange arrow from Gerar (box 6) towards Egypt marks the expulsion of Ishmael and Hagar into the wilderness of Beersheba&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separation was necessary to protect the son of the promise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red arrow from Beersheba to Jerusalem (box 7) denotes the path to and from the offering of Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Map credit&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-21-and-romans-galatians-and-hebrews&#34;&gt;Genesis 21 and Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An understanding of Genesis 21 is paramount to understanding Paul’s/Hebrew’s arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews and only these three New Testament books discuss Genesis 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acts references the birth of Isaac; James and Hebrews reference the sacrifice of Isaac in Genesis 22.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to read Galatians and come away that Paul was somehow anti-law or anti-Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This train of thought is deeply flawed and runs the risk of missing Paul’s points entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is focused not on Judaism as a whole, but on the Messiah-rejecting Jews who are knowingly or unknowingly continuing in legalism instead of accepting the free gift the Messiah brings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, the three books, and only these three New Testament books quote Habakkuk 2:4 (KJV) “but the just shall live by his faith.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews seem to form a trilogy on Habakkuk 2:4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme of Romans: who are the justified?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme of Galatians: how shall the justified live?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme of Hebrews: faith in the promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads many to suspect Paul is the author of Hebrews. If he did not, this is an even greater miracle, because whoever wrote Hebrews unknowingly completed the trilogy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-211-3&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:1-3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD took note of Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for Sarah as He had promised. So Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him. Abraham named his son who was born to him, the son whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:23 But the son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, and the son by the free woman through the promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:11 By faith even Sarah herself received the ability to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other translations say “God remembered Sarah.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not that God forgot, but that He remembered His promise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Appointed time” = &lt;em&gt;mo’ed.&lt;/em&gt; The Jewish festivals are Moedim. Shabbat is a moed. A moed is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Isaac was born on a festival day, just as some speculate Jesus might have been born on Yom Kippur or the first day of Tabernacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either day fits – He is our atonement and he dwells/tabernacles among us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Bible uses a miraculous birth to indicate that God has set aside that child for some great purpose.” (SOM 94)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yitzhak is related to the Hebrew verb &lt;span dir=&#34;rtl&#34;&gt;צחק&lt;/span&gt;, which means to laugh, but often carries a nuanced connotation of mocking/scorning or even sexual play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’ll unpack more at verse 9.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-214-7&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:4-7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. Now Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me.” And she said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have given birth to a son in his old age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically, in an age of high infant mortality rates, eight days, an infant was considered viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac was circumcised according to the letter of the law on the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is contrasted with Ishmael, who was circumcised at age 13; he was still circumcised, but in a typological sense, not when he “should” have been according to the Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the nuanced meaning of Tzahaq, this may not necessarily be laughing in joy, but laughing in amazement. Sarah and Abraham both laughed in disbelief and perhaps mockery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac’s birth was a true miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an overarching theme in the Bible of God miraculously opening a closed womb. This extends to Mary; although she was not barren in the traditional sense, her womb was miraculously opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God made EVERYTHING in Sarah come to life – she didn’t just give birth but was able to nurse for a couple of years after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-218-10&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:8-10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. Now Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking Isaac. Therefore she said to Abraham, “Drive out this slave woman and her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not be an heir with my son Isaac!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode becomes symbolic of the affliction of the Hebrew/Jewish people throughout the ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:29 But as at that time the son who was born according to the flesh persecuted the one who was born according to the Spirit, so it is even now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:31 So then, brothers and sisters, we are not children of a slave woman, but of the free woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to some reckonings, the 400 years of suffering and affliction culminating in the exodus from Egypt begins with this affliction of Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t have much background on any tradition of a weaning feast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know who Hagar is, but the Narrator wants us to remember her as “Hagar the Egyptian.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did Ishmael do that was so bad that he and his mother had to be driven out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s this word Tzahaq again, translated as mocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Laughter can be used for good or for ill.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 26:8 Now it came about, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked down through a window, and saw them, and behold, Isaac was &lt;strong&gt;caressing&lt;/strong&gt; his wife Rebekah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caressing = sporting = “Tzahaqing”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael ridiculing and poking fun at his younger brother probably wouldn’t have led to the banishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael was quite possibly a sexual predator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah refuses to speak his name. Whatever it was, it had to be bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust-along-the-talmidim-way&#34;&gt;Walking In His Dust Along The Talmidim Way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;talmidim-must-drive-out-fleshly-works-and-sin-from-our-lives&#34;&gt;Talmidim must drive out fleshly works and sin from our lives.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 5:7 Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, just as you are in fact unleavened. For Christ our Passover also has been sacrificed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another theme in the Bible is the firstborn son doing something to forfeit his inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, the firstborn son receives a double portion of the father’s estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the son does something wicked, he forfeits his promise; then the next in line receives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Ishmael but Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Esau but Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Reuben (and not Simeon or Levi) but Judah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we have an especially odd situation. Joseph was the firstborn of Jacob’s favorite wife Rebekkah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judah receives the official double portion, but Joseph also receives a double portion with Ephraim and Manaesseh being adopted by Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2111-13&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:11-13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matter distressed Abraham greatly because of his son Ishmael. But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed because of the boy and your slave woman; whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her, for through Isaac your descendants shall be named. “And of the son of the slave woman I will make a nation also, because he is your descendant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:28 And you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 9:7 nor are they all children because they are Abraham’s descendants, but: “THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS SHALL BE NAMED.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:18 it was he to whom it was said, “THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS SHALL BE NAMED.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banishment of Ishmael is Abraham’s 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see here that he was reluctant and was “distressed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He loved Ishmael.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His specific tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did he trust God to take care of him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did he trust God’s promises to make Ismael a great nation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did he trust Sarah’s judgment after the last time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial of Ishmael prepared him for the final test in Genesis 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God had previously promised a great future for Ishmael, but Isaac is the one who will inherit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s curious that the Narrator added, “whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her…”. Certainly, this was not the case in Genesis 16 or Genesis 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genesis 3:17 Then to Adam He said, “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat from it’; Cursed is the ground because of you; With hard labor you shall eat from it All the days of your life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2114-16&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:14-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Abraham got up early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water, and gave them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder, and gave her the boy, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered about in the wilderness of Beersheba. When the water in the skin was used up, she left the boy under one of the bushes. Then she went and sat down opposite him, about a bowshot away, for she said, “May I not see the boy die!” And she sat opposite him, and raised her voice and wept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:24 This is speaking allegorically, for these women are two covenants: one coming from Mount Sinai giving birth to children who are to be slaves; she is Hagar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 4:31 So then, brothers and sisters, we are not children of a slave woman, but of the free woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern makes an interesting comment at Galatians 4:24, “Nowhere does the account in Genesis denigrate Hagar, hense there is no reason to demean the Mosaic Law on the basis of this passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the Torah or Judaism, but people who have perverted the Torah and Judaism into a legalistic system, which is equivalent to a return to slavery in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is essentially the same territory where she wandered in chapter 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned in Israel that in Abraham’s day, towns were generally situated about a day’s journey apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He outfitted her with one day’s provisions with the expectation that she would “refuel” at the next town, perhaps Beersheba 15 miles from Gerar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, she doesn’t make it and heads into the wilderness/desert south of Beersheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did she make it but was turned away because of her “status”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could she not make it that far?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps distressed, did she meander aimlessly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2117-19&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:17-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God heard the boy crying; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What is the matter with you, Hagar? Do not fear, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. “Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him by the hand, for I will make a great nation of him.” Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another significant well moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as in chapter 16, God again sees Hagar and provides materially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also reiterates His promises that Hagar had forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well was there; she just couldn’t see it. That’s a picture of us some days. We can’t open our eyes enough to see the blessing before us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Romans and Galatians, many of us have a dim view of Hagar and Ishmael – certainly, some of this is deserved and as biblical types, they represent the things that we are supposed to reject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s remember the Bible’s worst sinners are pictures of you and me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishmael messed up “bigly.” We mess up too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here God reaches out and offers both Hagar and Ishmael His mercy and protection. We can be critical because it doesn’t appear that this mercy had any lasting effect. One would have hoped that they could have followed the God of Abraham. We have the same choices when God shows us mercy. How often does God bail us out or see us through a tough spot only to have us forget about God a few moments later?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust-along-the-talmidim-way-1&#34;&gt;Walking In His Dust Along The Talmidim Way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;when-things-seem-hopeless-talmidim-look-for-gods-promises&#34;&gt;When things seem hopeless, talmidim look for God’s promises.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes life hits us and we lose focus. When things seem bleak and we despair, we may need to open our eyes to the goodness of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Peter 3:14-15 But even if you should suffer for righteousness&amp;rsquo; sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2120-21&#34;&gt;Genesis 21:20-21&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God was with the boy, and he grew; and he lived in the wilderness and became an archer. He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paran is in the northeastern Sinai desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This region figures prominently in the Wilderness wanderings (specifically Numbers 13, where Kadesh-Barnea is located).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-22---abrahams-10supthsup-test-the-akedah-of-isaac&#34;&gt;Genesis 22 - Abraham’s 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; test: The Akedah of Isaac&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/gen22a.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is sacred to Jews and Christians alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jews recite the 19 verses every morning as a reminder of how we endure trials that prove our character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians rightfully see this as the beloved son “dying” and being “resurrected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer of Hebrews explains the figurative language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:17-19 By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son, [18] of whom it was said, “Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.” [19] He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac as a type of Jesus will continue in chapter 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is also incredibly troubling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn’t answer the obvious question we raise in response: how could God ask this of anyone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akedah means “binding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The binding is a foreshadowing of Matthew 27:2: And they &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;bound&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; him and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate the governor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-221&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these things, God tested Abraham and said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After what things? The previous nine tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KJV has “tempt,” which is not the best rendition of Nisah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sense is a test, like in boot camp where they push you to the limit to see what you’re made of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the word in Hebrew when Jesus quotes Deuteronomy 8 “you shall not put the Lord your God to the test.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Hebrew version of the Lord’s Prayer, the line “lead me not into tempatation” is literally, “do not bring me into the hands of a test.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God would never lead us into sinful temptation, and we should pray that we never have to be tested the way Abraham was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hineini&lt;/em&gt; – a great one-word Hebrew prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I am. Behold me. Look, me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, it is used to indicate one who is ready, willing, and able to serve God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-222-3&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:2-3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.” So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac. And he cut the wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your son:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebrew, Isaac’s name comes last&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew sages fill in the details of the discussion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your son – but I have two sons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your only/unique son – both are the only sons of their mothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yehidcha (lit. “your unique”) gets translated into Greek and Latin (e.g., church creeds) as “only begotten.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the sense is not a numeric designation but one of status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, of course, is both numerically singular and preeminent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whom you love – I love them both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Isaac – (OH!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/gen22b.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;66%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to the land&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew is “&lt;em&gt;Lech Lecha,&lt;/em&gt;” “go forth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same command God gave Abram in Genesis 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the command for the first test is, in this respect, identical to the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call of Abram culminated in the command to sacrifice Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mount Moriah is the area of Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God later directed David and Solomon to the exact same mountain to build the temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus Isaac’s offering is linked to the Temple sacrifices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Testament writers also link Jesus to these sacrifices, so we have a three-layered connection from Isaac, to the temple sacrifices, to Jesus’ once-and-for-all sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All involve the principle that the death of a righteous one provides atonement for the sins of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rose early” means Abraham didn’t hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IF Abraham is acting with the highest possible level of faith, it could be argued that he didn’t hesitate because God promised inheritance through Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God had the problem, not Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac must be resurrected for the promise to be fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wealthy Abraham even saddled his own donkey and even though over 100, he split the wood for the sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When God gives YOU a command, don’t hesitate and don’t delegate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three temptations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that Satan appeared to Abraham three times in an attempt to circumvent what he was about to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is fascinating as the Gospels record the three temptations of Jesus, each one offering Jesus a shortcut to avoid going to the Cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on the two young men as we work through the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-224&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac was “dead” to Abraham when the command came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the third day, he was “resurrected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosea 6:2 “He will revive us after two days; He will raise us up on the third day, That we may live before Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The place” becomes a proper noun. HaMakom. Jerusalem. The Place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-225&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; I and the boy will go over there and worship and come again to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How old is Isaac?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Christians imagine Isaac as a young child, perhaps around 10 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word translated as “boy,” is &lt;em&gt;naar&lt;/em&gt;, which means young lad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na’ar usually refers to a bachelor (while technically true, we don’t generally refer to 10-year-olds as bachelors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition claims Isaac was 37, which is based on Sarah’s age at Isaac’s birth and her death at 127. This is because Jewish tradition holds that Sarah’s death (described in Chapter 23) occurred due to the command to sacrifice Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While perhaps not exactly the same age, it does appear that both Isaac and Jesus were in their 30s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is going to return to the two youths?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that in this great test of faith, Abraham would knowing lie here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s more likely that he had THAT much faith that Isaac would be resurrected somehow (See Hebrews 11:17-18).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two also serve as the legally required two witnesses. If anyone needed to verify the story, they could have asked the servants who were there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-226-7&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:6-7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together. And Isaac said to his father Abraham, “My father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” He said, “Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/gen22c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;45%&#34; style=&#34;float:right&#34;/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Christians, this section certainly recalls Jesus making the journey to Golgotha under the weight of His cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This way of suffering is commemorated by the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem, which leads from the Antonio Fortress on the northeast side of the city to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Historically, Jesus was probably led from Pilate’s praetorium on the southwestern side of the Old City.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-228&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham said, “God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So they went both of them together..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our tour guide said, “Hebrew is cheap with words.” meaning one word can have multiple meanings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew phrase “Yireh-lo” could mean “he will see to it” or “he will provide himself.” It’s amazing that both are true here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God himself will provide the lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God will provide Himself as the lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the word for “provide” literally means “see,” God will see for Himself the lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is in the sense that when God saw the blood of the Passover lamb on the doorposts, the death angel passed over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is also deliberately connected to the Passover Lamb of God. 1 Corinthians 5:7b For Christ our Passover also has been sacrificed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Revelation, we see the Lamb as it had been slain. Revelation 5:6 “And I saw between the throne (with the four living creatures) and the elders a Lamb standing as if slaughtered, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both as one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take note when the Holy Spirit repeats something. Abraham also says “my son” twice in three verses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may wonder how an elderly Abraham coerced the younger Isaac into doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is straightforward. He didn’t coerce Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that Isaac knew about the outcome and went to the wood willingly…just like another Son did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion of a helpless child being obliviously led to his death doesn’t fit the text, and I would argue it doesn’t fit the character of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we see Isaac as a model of Jesus, we can better understand that Isaac knew what his father asked of him and did so willingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact many read this passage and conclude “God is condoning child sacrifice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposite is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pagan religions around Abraham appeared to all practice child sacrifice; but here God says, “not me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repeated instances of “they walked on together” and “my son” indicates emphasis on Abraham and Isaac’s unity. In fact &lt;em&gt;yachdav&lt;/em&gt;, “together,” means unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-229--the-binding&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:9 – the binding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we could ask whether a 100-year-old could bind a 37-year-old man against his will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the sages then ask, if Isaac was willing, why did Abraham need to bind him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the answer is that Isaac asked to be bound, lest he flinch and somehow invalidate the sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the knife had struck a non-vital area, such as a superficial wound on the arm, the ensuing sacrifice would not be “without blemish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, it was not necessary to bind Jesus, but they did so anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all the messianic parallels in this chapter aren’t enough, the very name of the chapter in Hebrew, Akedah, comes from a root word meaning striped, referring to the stripe-like marks left by the ropes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire story is named after the marks left on Isaac’s body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 53:5 (KJV) But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stripes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; we are healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages note that Abraham didn’t build &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt; alter there; he built &lt;em&gt;THE&lt;/em&gt; altar there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This becomes the altar of the Temple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2210-12--the-resurrection&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:10-12 – the “resurrection”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son. But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” He said, “Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him, for now, I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if Abraham had said, “not now, I’m busy”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hineni!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:19 (NASB) He considered that God is able to raise people even from the dead, from which he also received him back as a type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Writer to Hebrews was quoting a well-known tradition that Isaac died (some say literally) and was resurrected on the Altar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Torah Isaac did not die but often, these traditions, though seemingly fanciful, contain greater truths and insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Hebrews quotes this indicates the legend was well-known throughout the Jewish communities, which of course spread to the gentile churches. This should not surprise us as the early church leaders were all Jewish and would have passed on this and many other Jewish teachings that tie together Old Testament events with the life, death, and resurrection of Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2213-14--the-substitute&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:13-14 – the substitute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son. So Abraham called the name of that place, “The LORD will provide”; as it is said to this day, “On the mount of the LORD it shall be provided.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Y—H Yireh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Literally, “the LORD sees”, but in the sense of “he will see to it,” i.e., “provide.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It SHALL BE provided?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like it should say “The LORD provided,” but the verb is imperfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did Abraham know that this procedure acted out the prophecy in advance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t know for sure but it seems logical that when Jesus said, “Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day. He saw it and was glad” (John 8:56), namely the multiple references to “see,” Jesus was referring to this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ram also suggests a substitutionary offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and I are in Isaac’s shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We deserve death but God provides himself (literally), just as Abraham said in verse 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish tradition holds that the horns from Isaac’s ram that will herald the coming of the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2215-18&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:15-18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven and said, “By myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies, and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 6:13-15 For when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear an oath by no one greater, He swore by Himself, [14] saying, “INDEED I WILL GREATLY BLESS YOU AND I WILL GREATLY MULTIPLY YOU.” [15] And so, having patiently waited, he obtained the promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:12 Therefore even from one man, and one who was as good as dead at that, there were born descendants who were just as the stars of heaven in number, and as the innumerable grains of sand along the seashore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angel of the Lord begins the conversation but the words are God’s himself, so much that there is no distinction between the angel of the LORD and the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 10:30 “I and the Father are one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham passes this greatest test and the promise of offspring is reiterated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-his-dust-along-the-talmidim-way-2&#34;&gt;Walking In His Dust Along The Talmidim Way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;talmidim-can-expect-our-faith-to-be-tested&#34;&gt;Talmidim can expect our faith to be tested&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster writes, “Real faith requires real faithfulness. Real faith results in obedience. Every time we obey God, we prove our faithfulness.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three phases of Salvation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justification phase of salvation: one-time, yielding to Jesus as our savior. He does all the work. We simply cease resisting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctification phase of salvation: everything after that until you die that proves your justification is genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glorification phase of salvation: everything after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the same way a potter does not (bother to) test defective pots, but only sound vessels, the Holy One, blessed be He, does not test the wicked but only the righteous” (Genesis Rabbah 55:2).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his famous passage containing “faith without works is dead” (James 2:17), James, the brother of Jesus, used this story of Abraham as his proof text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James 2:20-24 But are you willing to acknowledge, you foolish person, that faith without works is useless? Was our father Abraham not justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected; and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “AND ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS,” and he was called a friend of God. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2219&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham lived at Beersheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who returned to the young men?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The casual reader concludes, rather obviously, Abraham AND ISAAC came down from the mountain, rejoined the two young men and returned to Beersheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not what the text says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac will not appear again until Genesis 24:62, when he meets Rebekkah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The son is sacrificed by the father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The son is “resurrected” (according to Hebrews).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The son “disappears” until he is united with his bride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you mean to tell me…? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genesis-2220-24&#34;&gt;Genesis 22:20-24&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now after these things it was told to Abraham, “Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor: Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” (Bethuel fathered Rebekah.) These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham&amp;rsquo;s brother. Moreover, his concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;we-need-to-look-beyond&#34;&gt;We need to look beyond&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a spiritual perspective, at some level Abraham knew that the promises to make him a great nation probably would not be achieved during his earthly lifetime.  He knew that God&amp;rsquo;s promises looked beyond death into the next age.  The same is true for us!&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-covenantal-obligation&#34;&gt;A Covenantal Obligation?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many respects, the Akedah cannot be completely understood without the lends of the New Testament that clarifies Abraham and Isaac was an act of prophecy that pointed to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancaster includes something extraordinary from Jewish tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A covenant is a two-way street,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first party can’t ask the second to do something the first person would not do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Abraham demonstrated his willingness to offer Isaac, the ball was now in God’s court to perform and reciprocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Abraham’s willing sacrifice asked for an equal show of covenant devotion from the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sacrifice of Isaac not only foreshadowed the sacrifice of Yeshua, IT DEMANDED IT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;messianic-parallels&#34;&gt;Messianic Parallels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Isaac from Bible and Jewish Tradition&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Jesus from Bible&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Exact likeness to his father Abraham.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“He who has seen me has seen the Father.” (John 14:9)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Promised son of the covenant with Abraham.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Promised Son of the covenant with Abraham and David&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A miraculous conception.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A miraculous conception.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Long awaited fulfillment of God’s promise.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Long awaited fulfillment of biblical prophecies.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sacrificed in Jerusalem by his father.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Suffered and died in Jerusalem by the will of His father.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Willingly complied.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Willingly complied.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Thirty six or thirty-seven years old.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;In His 30’s, possibly thirty-six.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Temple service later instituted on merit of Isaac’s sacrifice.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Temple service foreshadows suffering and atonement of Yeshua.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Resurrection on the third day&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Resurrection on the third day.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sacrifice atones for Jewish people.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sacrifice atones for all sinners.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tempted by Satan three times.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tempted by Satan three times.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Isaac carried the wood.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jesus carried His cross.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Blood of Isaac foreshadowed Passover lamb.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Blood of Messiah invoked the blood of the Passover lamb.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yachdav&lt;/em&gt; – United in will and purpose with his father.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“Not my will but yours be done” (Luke 22:42).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Bruised on his wrists and ankles by the ropes.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Scarred on His wrists and ankles by the nails.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On the merit of Isaac’s resurrection, the Jewish dead are raised.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On the merit of Jesus’ resurrection, the dead are raised.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;God kept His covenant with Abraham because Abraham did not withhold his son.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Abraham’s faithfulness required God not to withhold His son, extending Abraham’s covenants to those who are grafted into Abraham.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
