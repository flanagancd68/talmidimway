Hi there.  I'm Chris Flanagan, a Bible student and teacher with a passion for Israel and seeking the historical context.

The Talmidim Way is about studying a first-century itinerant Jewish rabbi named Yeshua who called a group of young men to follow Him, study Him, and eventually become like Him.  


In Hebrew, these men are called **Talmidim**, or disciples.  Yeshua's Great Commission was for us to become His talmidim, then go out and raise up others as effective talmidim.

History, archaeology, geography, and culture illuminate His **way** for 21st century disciples.  The more we understand his way, the more we can apply His truths to our lives and become more effective talmidim.

Join us on the "way of disciples" - the Talmidim Way!  

With us, you can go deep into His Word, learn His language and experience His land (virtually for now, in person someday soon!)!  Scroll down for additional details.
