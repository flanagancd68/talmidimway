_"Do you ever feel like you are following Jesus from a distance?  'Follow a rabbi, drink in his words, and be covered with the dust of his feet' says the ancient proverb.
In Jesus' day, disciples (תלמידם, or "talmidim") would follow their Rabbi so closely that they would be covered in the dust kicked up by His feet." -- Ray Van Der Lann_

Hi there.  I'm Chris Flanagan, a Bible student and teacher with a passion for Israel and seeking the historical context.  The more we know about the cultural, historical, and geographic contexts of the environment of  Jesus's day (or that of Paul, Moses, Samuel, etc.), the better we can follow the **way** of our Rabbi as his 21st century **talmidim**.

With us, you can go deep into His Word, learn His language, and experience His land (virtually for now, in person someday soon!)! Scroll down for additional details.
