Israel has been called the "5th Gospel" because for growing talmidim, there is no substitute for visiting the Bible lands in person.  Here you can walk in the footsteps of Jesus, indeed in the very dust He walked in.  It's been said that a week in Israel is equivalent to a year in Seminary in terms of advancing your spiritual growth and discipleship.
