Chris, in partnership with [Holy Language Institute](https://holylanguage.com) has developed two applications to help learn Biblical Hebrew and memorize several bible study passages in Hebrew.

* **Hebrew GRAMMAR Quest** is our newest course.  It is equivalent to a first-year seminary course but it is **free** and entirely self-paced.
* **Hebrew Quest Memrise** is a supplement to Holy Language Institute's _Hebrew Quest_ 40-lesson video program designed to introduce students to the Hebrew Alephbet (yes, we spelled that correctly!) and into the Bible.
