summary: 'The Samaritans remind us how relatively easy it is to stray off course.  We need to let Jesus correct us just as He did with the discussion with Samaritan woman and the story of the Good Samaritan.'

Two of Jesus' most famous encounters involve Samaritans.  

* The first in John 4 is His discussion with the Samaritan woman at Jacob's well, where, among other things, Jesus correct the Samaritan misconception about the God they are worshipping.  
* The second is in Luke 10.  This one isn't directed _to_ a Samaritan, but it's _about_ a Samaritan.  A Torah scholar wants to know how far he needs to take this "love your neighbor" thing.  Again, Jesus corrected his thinking.

Both the Samaritan woman and the Jewish man had strayed off course.  We run the same risk, if we don't let Jesus correct our courses.  Let's explore the backround of the Samaritans and see what they can teach us about staying on the right track.
