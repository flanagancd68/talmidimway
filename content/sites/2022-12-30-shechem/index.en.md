Practically every waking moment of our lives, we are making choices.  What should I do next, or which option should I pick?  

Many of these involve mundane tasks.  Should I take out the trash or do the dishes?  Sometimes we artificially limit ourselves.  Which show should I watch?  Well, who says you need to watch anything (unless it’s talmidim way videos)? 

Other choices can have spiritual significance, and some may even have eternal consequences. We need to ask ourselves, “By this choice, am I living for God or living for myself?”
