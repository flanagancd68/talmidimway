When we visit Israel, we see Scripture in an entirely new light.  The black and white pages of your Bible come alive.  

We'll visit the ancient sites where Jesus lived and taught, and understand the first-century context...and the cost...of discipleship. 

We are planning to partner with GTI Tours, the leader in Biblical study tours. Unlike other Holy Land tours, this tour is solely focused on bringing Scripture to life through first-hand experiences in the places the stories actually happened. As an all-inclusive trip, you’ll be free to focus on each moment without worrying about lodging, tips, transportation, entrance fees, food or water.  We want you to be fully focused on the lessons and experiences you’ll encounter, and not be distracted by local tipping practices, transportation arrangements, or meal planning.

Pastor Lyn, Chris, and other teachers from CBC Bonham will be leading us in challenging devotions at each site. We have a shepherd’s heart and a passion for God’s word.  After a trip to Israel, you will come back a changed disciple and your walk with Jesus will never be the same!
