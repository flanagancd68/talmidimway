  caption: Day 5 Golan Heights and the North.  We will visit a working 1st-century village in Katzrin to understand what life was like for the people Jesus ministered to.  Then we'll visit Caesarea Philippi where Peter made his famous declaration that Jesus was indeed the promised Messiah.  We'll also visit Tel Dan to see how God's people can easily stray into idolatry.

  caption: Day 6 We'll stop at Beth Shean and Caesarea Maritima where we can feel the political and religious power Rome had upon the people in the 1st-century (including those in the seven cities of Revelation).  Caesarea is also where this Jewish sect of the Nazarenes became open to gentiles like you and me.  We'll also stop at Megiddo, which is also referenced in the book of Revelation as the staging ground of one of the final End Times rebellions against God and His Messiah.

  caption: Day 7 Jerusalem. We'll tour the Temple Mount, the most hotly contested piece of real estate on the planet.  We'll pray at the Western Wall and tour the Rabbinic Tunnels before heading south to Bethlehem to visit the Church of the Nativity - the spot that marks the night when God came down to save us.

  caption: Day 8 Jerusalem.  We'll visit the City of David, the former Jebusite stronghold David conquered.  We'll walk through Hezekiah's water tunnel, an amazing engineering feat for its day, before heading to West Jerusalem to visit the Shrine of the Book of Isaiah and the 1st-century model of Jerusalem at the Israel Museum.  We'll conclude the day at the sobering Yad Vashem museum.

  caption: Day 9 Jerusalem.  We'll begin our day atop the Mount of Olives, where Jesus began His Palm Sunday journey and were Zechariah 14:4 says God will place His feet when He comes again.  At the Kidron Valley, we'll worship Him at the Garden of Gethsemane and remember the price He paid. We'll walk the Via Dolorosa, which commemorates His journey to the Cross.  Finally, we will have a special farewell dinner before heading to the airport for our flights back to the US.
