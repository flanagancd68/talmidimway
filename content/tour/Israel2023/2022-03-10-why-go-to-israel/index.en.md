>   *"Walk about Zion, go around her, count her towers, consider well her rampart, view her citadels, that you may tell of them to the next generation. For this God is our God forever and ever; He will be our guide even to the end." - Psalm 48:12-14*

>   *“Many facts and scenes, which seem to float ghost-like in the clouds to a distant reader, assume flesh and blood in the land of their birth. There is a marvelous correspondence between the Land and the Book. The Bible is the best handbook for the Holy Land, and the Holy Land is the best commentary on the Bible.” Philip Schaff (1813-1893), pp. 383-4*

>   *“A trip to Israel is worth a year in seminary.” Pastor Chuck Smith (1927-2013)*

For Christians, the Land of Israel is often called the “5th Gospel”. Seeing the country firsthand can be as revealing as the four Gospels when it comes to understanding the life of Jesus. You will be amazed at how your spiritual life will change and your faith strengthened. You will never read the Bible the same again. What was once black and white is now in color.  One-dimensional words on a page now come alive as you experience with all your senses.

### Why go to Israel? 

1.  Sharper comprehension of the Bible
2.  Clearer understanding of biblical application
3.  More effective communication of truth to others
4.  A framework for better memory of biblical events
5.  Greater confidence in the Word of God—having seen the places the Bible speaks of
6.  More vibrant spiritual life and deeper love for God (99% of those who go affirm this)
7.  Learning the Word of God will all your senses
8.  Seeing the Bible when you read it for the rest of your life
9.  Experiencing a dimension of authenticity and history to your faith you could gain no other way
10. A window of opportunity that may not last (the political situation and lifting of many Covid restrictions is ideal for tourism now)

> **It is our desire that you fall deeply in love with your Messiah, the Biblical Text and the land of Israel, so that your life is changed forever.**

### What's in it for me?

On this tour, we will help you connect the Bible and its lands to your life. Every site and activity has been prayed over with YOU in mind!

1.  You will learn the Word of God right where it happened—with Bible in hand. After seeing where Jesus ministered, you will never read your Bible the same way again!
2.  Our Israeli guide will teach you cultural and historical connections as he travels with us
3.  You will gain a deeper understanding of Jesus’ purpose and life
    - His ministry wasn’t a random set of good deeds, teachings, and miracles on His way to die for our sins in Jerusalem
    - Every step, every stop, every act of His was intentional
4.  You will discover how He developed the lives of His *talmidim* (disciples)
5.  More importantly, you’ll learn how He is working in your life in the same way; you are His *talmid* also!
6.  You will have dozens if not hundreds of memories (as well as notes and photographs) to remember and use in your Bible study
7.  You will have a journal (if you choose) and other reference material that will help you recall the wealth of information you will be exposed to along the way
8.  Every time you open your Bible, you will picture the landscape you walked
9.  You will watch the sun set over the Sea of Galilee—just as Jesus saw it
10. You will get the feel of the land as you experience the Holy City of Jerusalem with all your senses
11. You will hear the Word of God in the Capernaum Synagogue—the very place where Jesus preached
12. You will enjoy the fragrances in every place—from the aromatic Jerusalem markets to the salty seaside port of Caesarea
13. You will experience the fellowship of other Christians as we travel the lands of the Bible together
14. You will have an opportunity to experience Genesis 12:3 first-hand (God will bless those who bless Israel) through a small service project that can have a big impact
15. You will taste the delicious meals of Israeli culture (which probably hasn't changed all that much since the 1st century)

### Who will be leading the tour?

*We have requested proposals from multiple reputable tour companies.  We will update this page once we have made a selection.*

-   We will be using an experienced tour operator: Name TBD <website>
-   Our guide's name is TBD <guide bio>
-   We will have many opportunities for worship through song, prayer, and short teachings/devotionals at each site

### What is a typical day?

-   Since for many of us this will be our one and only time to go to Israel, we want the agenda to be full but not overwhelming
-   7:00-7:30: Breakfast
-   8:00-8:30 on the bus
    -   We will do prayer and devotion en-route to the first site

-   6:30-7:00 return to the hotel for dinner
-   8:00 recap, evening devotions, prayer, worship

### How should I prepare?

This is not just a vacation where you need to pack a few things.  This is a *spiritual journey*.  The *spiritual* part means that to get the most out of our tour, we need to prepare our hearts and minds.  The *journey* part means we will be doing a LOT of walking, and much of it on uneven terrain.  We need to make sure our physicial body is ready for what we are about to do.

We've developed tips to address these questions on our "prep" ([Physical](../physical)/[Spiritual](../spiritual)) pages!

Throughout the weeks leading up to the tour, we will be posting information on these pages about various sites and other travel tips. In early 2023, we will offer a multi-week course that teaches about various sites through the life of Jesus, as well as some background on history and geography.  This will give us a greater context in which to understand His powerful words.

### What will I need to bring?

-   There is a comprehensive packing list on our [Physical Prep](../physical) page.  
-   See the [Clothing](../clothing) page for tips on (wait for it) clothing.
-   Always bring a positive, Christ-like attitude! You are His ambassador in a part of the world that has had valid reasons to be [distrustful of Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_deicide).

### Do they speak English?

YES. English is an official language of Israel. Most signs are in Hebrew, English, and Arabic. Our guide is fluent in both Hebrew and English. See the ["Learn Hebrew"](/courses/) if you are interested in learning a little Hebrew.

### How much will this cost, what is included and when do I pay?

TBD -We are in the process of securing bids.

*See the [Money](../money) page for what the price includes and excludes.*

There will be three payment dates to remember

1. A due date for submitting a refundable deposit to reserve your spot
2. A date where 50% of the price will be due
3. A due date for the Remaining 50%, along with your [Passport](../passport) information

### Can I invite others who don't attend CBC Bonham?

As long as space is available, and the person can handle the physical rigor of a tour of this nature, all are welcome!

### Can I bring my kids?

Jr. High or High School kids are more than welcome to participate. Experiencing Israel as a child along with your family is a blessing that will abide in their reading of the Bible forever, and there is no more amazing location to create lifelong family memories.

Given the academic nature of this trip, homeschool academic credit may be available.
