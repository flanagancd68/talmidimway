Other items to bring

-   **Bible** (hard copy or electronic) -
    -   If you want a hardcopy, consider a slimline version for size and weight reasons.
    -   Consider your phone as a "Swiss Army Knife" - you may wish to leave your hardcopy books and your large cameras at home and just use your phone
    -  Make sure your Bible app can be used without an internet connection
-   [**Passport**](https://goo.gl/xnztR7) … Passport … [Passport](../passport)
    -   Also keep other travel documents handy such as your final flight and ground itinerary (to be provided by tour guide)
    -   A travel pouch for these documents (i.e. a [neck pouch)](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=neck+travel+pouch&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Aneck+travel+pouch) is a good idea - your passport should be on your person unless you are in your hotel room
-   **Notebook** for taking notes and journal recordings
    -   **Note: many people return and wish they had taken better notes. We will be visiting a lot of sites and things will start to run together. Bring a journal!**
    -   Alternatively you can use something like Evernote to store both text and a few photos of each site; you can also create a simple blog for free with [postach.io](https://postach.io)
-   **Pens** (a pen w/ grip is helpful as sweating makes it hard to hold)
    -   Some bring a hi-lighter to map the routes we take on a map
-   **Backpack** or Fanny pack - for carrying camera, wallet, pen, journal
    - You pack it, you carry it - "less is more"
-   **Medications** 
    - Prescription
    - Non-prescription may include head/muscle ache relief, Immodium-d (better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it!), sleep-aid, vitamins, or supplements. 
    - If you forget something, there are drug stores
    - If applicable, bring a record of any important medical allergies, medicines, etc.
-   Powdered drink pouches you can mix with a bottle of water, such as for electrolyte replenishment (Gatorade etc)
-   Protein snacks, such as individual nut bags; avoid chocolate as it melts
-   Small and large ziplock bags for snacks, collectibles (write on the bag what it is and where found)
    -   It is against Israeli law to remove historical artifacts
-   Inflatable pillow or neck rest for use on the plane, eye mask, ear plugs (see [Jetlag](../flight-tips) article)
-   Small bag (like a mesh tie bag) for items you want to leave on the bus for the day. The driver will always stay with the bus, or it will be locked.
-   Packs of disposable cloths (Wet Ones) may come in handy
-   Hand sanitizer, sanitizing wipes
-   Aloe for sunburn and baby or talcum powder for heat rash
-   If you struggle with any hip, knee, or ankle pain, you may want to consider purchasing collapsible [**trekking poles**](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Trekking+poles+collapsing&ref=nb_sb_noss)
-   For women, bring feminine hygiene products
-   If you are prone to chaffing, bring anti-chafe balm 
-   Sunscreen (the sport kinds are best as they are generally sweat proof) & Chapstick w/ SPF

###  What not to bring

-   Books, excessive photo/video gear, or anything that adds unnecessary weight, bulk, or complexity that will slow you down or distract you from meeting with Yeshua/Jesus
    -   Just use your phone.
