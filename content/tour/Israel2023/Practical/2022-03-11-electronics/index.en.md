> We encourage you to bring and use devices only to supplement your Holy Land experience. Otherwise try to "unplug" from daily life as much as possible. Make arrangements with work and other obligations to have them leave you alone and for you to be disconnected as much as possible.

### Cell Phones/Wi-Fi

-   You will find using a US-based cellular voice/data service on a network in Israel will be expensive, but you have options.
    -   Wi-Fi is everywhere, including on the buses. Consider using Wi-Fi for voice/messaging.
        -   Your phone should have the ability to shut off cellular data.
        -   Note that “SMS” messages are still sent using cellular data (so if your cellular data is off, you may not receive them).
        -   There are lots of messaging, audio, and video chat apps available for both Apple and Android that work over Wi-Fi
    -   Your carrier may offer a short-term international plan for cellular voice and/or data.
        -   Make sure it covers Israel.
        -   If your company can’t be without you, see if they will pay for the international plan (mine did!).
    -   You can bring an unlocked phone and buy a pre-paid SIM card once in Israel.
        -   About 10 years ago, this was the way to go.
        -   Nowadays, WiFi is everywhere.
    -   You could tell folks back home that you’ll be unavailable!
- **Protip**: Want to cut down on work voicemail when you return?  Include the following on your outgoing announcement:
  - Explain that you are out of the office until whichever date
  - State that you will NOT be checking voicemail while you are away
  - Provide information of someone to contact if they need something that can't wait until you return
    - Of course that person and your boss should be able to reach you in a crisis
  - Otherwise, ask them to call back after you return
  - And do not say "messages will be returned when I get back"
  - Most people will want to respect your personal time and it's often a "pride thing" that tells us our company won't survive without us

Cellphone etiquette

**Please do not make or take calls during teachings**
-   If you MUST take a call while we are touring, please respect the “space” of those around you so everyone will have a great trip!
    -   The person next to you might be interested in your conversation but the person in front of you probably is not.
-   Your guides (and leaders) may frequently be on the phone coordinating logistics for our group, but they are “on the clock.” You are on vacation!

### Cameras

> Think of your cell phone as a swiss army knife; one tool with many uses.  Most cell phones have excellent cameras. Consider leaving the big DLSR at home!

-   Look for any opportunity to have one less thing to be a distraction, one less thing to carry around, one less thing to have to charge, one less thing to potentially leave behind somewhere (etc.)
    - I'm speaking from personal experience
    -   Make sure you have enough storage on your phone and a way to offload photos if you happen to run low on space.
-   We typically have long days, so you may consider bringing a lightweight portable charger you can keep with you while touring.
-   If you are bringing a separate camera, be sure to have sufficient batteries and memory sticks (unless you are bringing a computer to download photos on). 
    - If you are bringing rechargeable batteries, consider bringing two sets; one to be left in the hotel room charging, the other out and about with you.
-   GoPros are great, but battery life is notoriously terrible (the older the model, the worse the battery life)! Plan accordingly.

### Converters/Adapters:

-   Electricity in Israel is 220v 50hz and their plugs are also configured differently than ours.
-   You will need an **adapter** in order to plug in anything that needs recharging.
-   Most modern electronic devices smartphones, cameras, laptops) automatically convert the voltage so a separate converter generally isn’t needed.
    -   Check your power supply for the input voltage range. If it says something like 110-250v, all you need is an adapter for the plug.
    -   If it only says 110v you will need a **converter**. **Never plug your 110V appliance into a 220v outlet using only an adapter.**
-   Cautions
    -   Beware of cheap, poor-quality adapters. Price them on Amazon or wherever, and don’t buy the cheapest
    -   **Always make sure your devices are charging before going to bed or you may wake up in the morning and find your device has not charged.**
-   **TIP-**bring a regular US power strip in your suitcase, and get a good quality European/Israeli adapter. You’ll be able to plug your devices into the power strip and won’t need individual adapters for each plug.
-   You likely will not need a hair dryer as the hotels and guest-houses should have them.
-   **TIP** Don’t bring anything that needs ironing and you won't need to bring an iron!
