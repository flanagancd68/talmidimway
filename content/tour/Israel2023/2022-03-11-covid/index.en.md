As of March 1, 2022 our understanding is:

* Covid vaccinations are no longer required for entry to Israel, or for US citizens returning
  * In fact, Israel's lifting of the vaccine requirement was the signal God used to tell us it was time to go!
* As of now, masks remain required on all flights and, in Israel, in indoor public spaces
* A negative PCR test is required ("regardless of age or vaccination status") to enter both countries
* We will pray these remaining restrictions are relaxed between now and the time we travel

{{< callout warning >}}
Of course all of this information is subject to change

* For better, if the pandemic is declared resolved
* For worse, if COVID resurfaces
{{< /callout >}}

We will keep this page updated should requirements change.  A change for the worse, could mean we need to postpone our trip. 

**Please make sure your trip cancellation insurance includes global health-related reasons, including your being unwilling/unable to comply with government COVID requirements that may be in place on the date of our departure.**
