>   Crossing a frontier can be an intimidating experience. Security, government, and airline officials speak English and are interested in moving things along, but there may be officials who were born to be suspicious, or who revel in their authority to search you or in their power to deny you entry to their country.

>   Having said that, security reigns supreme in a country that can’t have it otherwise. The young men and women asking questions are usually polite, but they take their job very seriously – and passengers should be glad they do.

>  Bottom line: Be patient, expect questions, answer frankly, don't volunteer information unless asked, don’t get uptight or confrontational. They’ve got time; you’ve got a country to see. In short, make it easy for yourself by making it easier for them. If they seem to be getting irritated with you, you keep your cool and keep smiling.  They are just doing their jobs.

Don't worry about memorizing all of these details, and there is no need to print this page (it is better if you didn't).

We will review the details once more immediately before we leave.

### Passports

-   All travelers including minors must have a valid passport - valid at least six months AFTER the date you exit Israel
    -   In other words, if your passport expires on/before 11/15/2023, you MUST get it renewed before you leave home.
    -   Also, you will need your valid passport# and expiration date at the time you book your travel -
-   Information on [obtaining a passport is here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply.html)
-   If you need to renew, do yourself a favor and [RENEW IT NOW!](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/renew.html)
-   No additional paperwork (e.g. visas) or shots are required for US citizens
-   If you are not a US citizen, please let Chris know and we can discuss specific requirements for your country
-   Before leaving home, make **two** copies of the information page - leave one with someone you could easily contact while you are on your trip and put the other one in your suitcase.

{{< callout warning >}}

-  While in transit, **keep your passport on your person at all times.**  You will need to produce it at all airports.
    - Never pack your original passport in your suitcase.
    - Do not stick it in the seat pocket in front of you (it's too easy to leave behind)
  
{{< /callout >}}

- A backpack is fine; just make sure it can't fall out accidentally.
- Neck pouches or waist belts are options

### Secondary Security Screening Before Leaving the Us

-   You will go through the usual TSA screening that all passengers have to do
- What is different is that before the direct flight to TLV there will usually be a *secondary* security screening at the GATE.
-   This is almost EXACTLY like the airport security when you first departed from your home airport – coats off, shoes off, laptops out, etc.
    -   ASK if you can bring unopened bottled water. This seems to vary from place to place.
-   These checkpoints generally open two hours before takeoff
    -   This is not as bad as it seems - flights sometimes start boarding an hour *or more* before departure time
-   There are NO FOOD OR RESTROOMS on the other side of the checkpoint - if you leave the area you will need to be rescreened again.
-   You will need to show your Passport here, and then again when you board.

### Arriving In Israel

{{< callout note >}}
Before You Leave Your Seat:

**Do you have your Passport? Phone? Wallet? Camera? Glasses? Name Badge?**
{{< /callout >}}

-   There is no other way to say this - you are likely to be "out of it" after the long flight
-   Look around between seats, under the seat in front of you as well as under your own seat, etc; be eyes for others in our group as well
-   Make sure you are now wearing your Name Badge
-   *Soak in the fact that you are now in a very special Land that God calls His own.*

### Israeli Passport Control

>   Given the level of tension in the region, it will be no surprise that security at Israel’s airports is stringent.

-   As you walk through the terminal you will eventually come to passport control - get in the lines for non-Israeli citizens and have your passport ready
-   Between the fatigue, slow-moving lines, and "guilty until proven innocent" stance from the guards, **Passport Control can truly test a believer's witness**
-   There will be repeated questions about what you intend to do while in Israel.
-   If you don't know something just say, "*I don't know*" (the name or address of someone in Israel, for example), and let them ask a follow-up question.
-   If they ask where you are going, an acceptable first answer is that we are going primarily to Galilee and Jerusalem with our tour group
    - Don't give them a day-by-day activity list. Let them follow up with questions if they need more specifics.  
    - The type of tour we are doing is probably the most common tour
    -   Everyone on our tour should be wearing their name badge, which may make it easier for the officers to determine who is with whom
-   Sometimes they may act like you're in trouble when you really are not.  They do this to see how you respond. It's OK!
-   You will have our guide's cell and contact information on the formal itinerary.
    -   If you are stopped for questioning having this type of information can help, but again, it is not necessary to volunteer the itinerary unless they ask for it
-   Be aware that passengers who have recently visited Arabic countries OR who are of Arab or Indian descent, or have an Arabic or Indian name, or in any other way arouse suspicion for any reason, may be subject to further questioning (including email and social media accounts)
-   If you are detained please kindly request that you be allowed to notify one of our leaders
-   Once cleared, you will be given a paper receipt which is your 90-day entry visa (Israel does not stamp passports). **Do not lose this.**

{{< callout note >}}
 *Answer their questions and do not chat, make jokes, or volunteer information unless you are asked for it*
 
 MILLIONS of Americans come and go each year without incident.  
 
 With any luck, we've *over*prepped you and you'll sail through wondering what all the fuss was about!

### Israeli Customs

-   After the Passport Control process is concluded, walk around behind the kiosk and enter the huge baggage claim hall where you will pick up your bags.
-   Make sure those traveling with you stay together.
-   Grab your bag and head through the green "nothing to declare" sign (unless of course, you have something to declare) - you likely will not be stopped here
-   Representatives from our group will be in the waiting area and will be identifiable

*You made it to the Promised Land! We're going to have an amazing trip!*

### Departing Israel

{{< callout note >}}
Our guides will walk us through all of this again on the day of departure.  Feel free to ask any questions at any time.
{{< /callout >}}

-   After several amazing days it will sadly be time to head back home.
-   Certain larger purchases are eligible for Value Added Tax refund.  When you make such a purchase, the vendor may provide you with a form, or you can get one at the airport.  **Complete and drop off any VAT forms before going through security**
-   Keep your passport accessible at all times. Just about everyone in the airport will want to see it at some point (at least that's how it feels).

**1st Stage-Baggage Screening and interview**

-   My personal experience is that these guards are always incredibly friendly
  - They want you to be relaxed; just follow the same advice as on entry: be honest but not overly chatty.
-   Typical first questions are, “**Did you pack your bag yourself?**” and “**Where was it after you packed it?**” (was it standing for an hour in a hotel corridor, for instance, where someone could have tampered with it? In our case, the likely answer will be that our bags were on the bus in a locked compartment.)
-   Another question is likely to be, **“Did anyone give you something to take with you?”**
    -   While your mind may immediately go to something illicit and tempt you to answer "no", the **answer to this question is almost always "yes"**
    -   Our guide may give us items such as maps, or olive wood communion cups as souvenirs. These count.
    -   Don’t let them find it on their own and then ask you why you didn’t mention it in the first place.
-   They may pull different members of our group (including husbands and wives) out of the queue for questioning. Don't be alarmed. This is routine. They will then compare answers.  Since we were all at the same places doing the same things, there shouldn't be any problems. 
-   Next step is a large scanner for your check-through luggage.
    -   Follow instructions to load your bags
    -  Wait for the bags on the other side of the machine.
    -   The checker on his/her monitor either clears a particular bag by putting a bar-coded paper strip on it, or sends you to another station a few steps away if there is some unidentifiable item or container that requires opening the bag.
    -   It’s on a bag-by-bag not passenger-by-passenger basis.
    -   This part is not too unlike TSA screening - if they can't figure out what something is they will do a manual inspection. 
    - If your bag is pulled, it's not a big deal (unless you have something to hid, which you shouldn't!). Don't get alarmed (and definitely don't get defensive or irritated!)

**2nd Stage** - Airline Check in; keep your passport out.

**3rd Stage** - usual passenger screening/carry on security and passport control exit.  If you've made it this far, there is unlikely to be any drama.

Now if all went smoothly we may have an hour or two to chill in the beautiful terminal before boarding. Savor your memories!


### United Stated Re-entry

-   For those who have never done it, returning into the USA is almost always a non-event for US citizens
-  Check your app store for "Mobile Passport Control", which advertises seamless reentry into the US  **you will want to download this before you get on the plane in Israel**
-   You will be given a customs and border form to complete; again keep this with your passport or they may direct you to use the app
  - If you're using the app, answer the prompts and you should get a QR code to eventually show to an agent or a machine
  - For those who don't want to use the app, there might RFID/biometric machines available to further expedite
  - If not, queue up and wait your turn for a US immigration agent
-   If you are connecting within another airport in the US you will, go through the process above, then you will have to get your checked bags, clear customs and then re-check for the connecting flight to Dallas 
  - The exact process will depend on your connecting airport and airline - some make it easier than others...
  - After you check in, the remainder of the process will be the same as if you were on a domestic flight...because you are on a domestic flight

{{< callout note >}}
If you are connecting to a US-bound flight from an airport outside the US, you likely will not have to go through passport control or customs in the connecting country, but you may have to rescreen for security.
