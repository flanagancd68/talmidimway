You're invited you to experience the holy land with us on a 12 day, all-inclusive Israel Study Tour.

Israel has been called the "5th Gospel" because it is here where Jesus came down to earth, where He called His *talmidim* (disciples) and where He taught them to follow His example: to love God with all our hearts and to love our neighbors as ourselves.

Visit Israel and you will never read your Bible the same way again!
