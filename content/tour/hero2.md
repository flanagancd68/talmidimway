### Spring 2023

Are you ready for the black and white pages of your Bible to come alive in high definition color?

Youâ€™re invited you to experience the holy land with us on a 12 day, all-inclusive Israel Study Tour.

Israel has been called the "5th Gospel" because it is here where Jesus came down to earth, where He called His _talmidim_ (disciples) and where He taught them to follow His example: to love God with all our hearts and to love our neighbors as ourselves.
