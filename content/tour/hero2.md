### Spring 2023

Youâ€™re invited you to join us on a 12 day, all-inclusive Israel Study Tour.

Israel has been called the "5th Gospel." It is here where God came down to earth in the form of a man, Jesus, who called his _talmidim_ (disciples) and taught them to follow His example: to live and die for us all.
