* A study tour provides the following <u>kingdom-focused benefits</u> (Matthew 6:19-21):
  * A deeper love for Jesus and understanding of His model and methods to raise disciples (Jn 14:15)
  * Greater comprehension of the Bible and biblical applications as we "apply the Land and it lessons to life" (GTI Tours slogan)
  * More effective communication of biblical truth to others (Deut 6:6-7; Mt 28:19-20)
  * Greater confidence in God's Word - our faith is rooted in real events that occurred in real places (Jn 5:1, Luke 10:30; Ps 125:2)


    
Common Questions:
{{< spoiler text="**What is the Estimated Cost?**" >}}
We are budgeting around $4700 per person.

This amount is _preliminary_.  Once we can confirm a minimum number of attendees (30), GTI can confirm the price.
Post-COVID, prices are up everywhere - jet and diesel fuel costs are particularly volatile. We will do what we can to keep costs down without sacrificing teaching content.

For comparison, note the costs of other current, post-COVID, Israel tours (and the three examples below don't include three meals/day like ours would)

* First Baptist Dallas 2022: **$5398**
* Stonebriar Frisco 2022: **$5638**
* Wayne Stiles (affiliated with Stonebriar) 2022: **$5592**

**We encourage you to think of this study tour as an investment in your ministry, just as if you were taking a seminary course**

{{< spoiler text="When are the payment deadlines?" >}}
Once we confirm our trip is a "go", GTI will begin contracting and pricing.  At that time, we will know the final cost and they will set up an online registration portal.

In looking at similar tours, we can _estimate_ the following deadlines (assuming April 30, 2023 departure)

| *Estimated* Date | Minimum Payment 
| :--: | :-- | :--
| Deposit ASAP to hold your spot | $500 
| 12/12/2022 | 50% of balance
| 3/13/2023 | Remaining Balance 


Cancellation fees depend on how far in advance the cancellation occurs. _Trip Cancellation Insurance would reimburse losses for **covered** cancellation reasons. Be sure to read the coverage terms carefully._  There is a difference between medical and cancellation insurance. We recommend both as frequently, US-based health insurance is not valid overseas.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="When exactly would we go?" >}}As soon as we can confirm with GTI that the trip is a go (in terms of a minimum interest level) they will begin the process of confirming dates. 

We are expecting April 30 - May 11, 2023, but this could change.  Mid-April and mid-May are ideal times.  In late May and into the summer it is just too hot.  As of now, the flights are departing DFW around 8:20 pm, allowing us to leave after Sunday services on 4/30/23.{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Is it safe?" >}} Just about everyone who's been there returns with the feeling that Israel is one of the safest places they've ever visited.  The country takes security very seriously.  The main conflict area is the Gaza Strip and we won't be anywhere near there. 

Remember, the media's motto is "if it bleeds, it leads," so they sell fear.  Fear is not from God (1 John 4:18) and millions of tourists visit Israel every year. Our guides are well-connected in terms of security; should any trouble spots arise, we will avoid them. 
{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="What is the COVID situation?" >}} 
As of 5/20/2022, Israel requires only a health questionnaire to be completed.  Thee are no longer vaccine or negative test requirements to enter the country.  Should a traveler test positive for COVID while in country, a four-day quarantine period would be imposed.

US Citizens may reenter the country without a vaccine, but they must supply a negative test prior to returning.  Should this requirement still be in effect when we travel, GTI will arrange for the COVID testing in Israel.
{{< /spoiler >}}


{{< spoiler text="What is included in the cost?" >}}
R/T economy class air from DFW ✧ Deluxe Hotels ✧ Buffet dinner and breakfast daily ✧ Lunches served on site ✧ Deluxe motor coach touring ✧ Hydration backpack with bottled water on tour ✧ All transfers, porterage, entrance fees and taxes ✧ Guide and driver tips ✧ Study guides, journals ✧ Pre-trip online course

Many other tours do not include lunches, unlimited water, or the comprehensive study materials, and yet are more expensive than ours will be.  So a lower sticker price on a different tour wouldn't necessarily be an "apples-to-apples" comparison. 

GTI structures their tours to be fully "all-inclusive" so we can devote our full attention to the study of His Land.  You would not have to spend a single additional dollar (or in this case, Shekel) if you didn't want to.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="What is not included?" >}}

Drinks with meals (other than water) ✧ Snacks in-between meals ✧ COVID tests (if still required) ✧ Passport fees ✧ Travel insurance 

_Travel insurance is **HIGHLY** recommended, particularly given the somewhat fluid COVID situation. Be sure to read COVID cancellation coverage carefully, particularly in the event you are unwilling to travel because of COVID requirements that may be in effect at the time of our departure (including those requirements that may be more restrictive than those in place when you first reserved your trip)._

{{< spoiler text="Can I go if I don't attend CBC Bonham?" >}}

If you attend a church with a like-minded faith tradition (SBC or similar), then **wholeheartedly, yes you are invited!!** Invite your friends and family too!

Please complete the contact form below and we will keep you in the loop with the latest information.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="How large will our group be?" >}}
GTI requires a minimum of 30 travelers and can accept up to 53.

{{< spoiler text="How do I prepare?" >}}GTI has been leading tours since the early 1990s and they have mastered the art of preparation! They have an extensive [on-line preparation guide](https://gtitours.org/study-tour-preparation-guide), complete with videos, articles and downloadable checklists.

Once we contract with them we will get access to their full preparation program, which will include specific practical and physical instruction tips as well as a brief biblical geography course that can be completed on-line.
{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Is the tour physically strenuous?" >}}One of the aspects of a study tour that is often overlooked is that we engage our bodies with the biblical text - and this can't happen anywhere but Israel (or Greece, Turkey, etc).  We walk where Jesus, Peter and David walked! Verses like Matthew 4:13 that we may have skimmed over in the past now take on a new and vivid significance.

While many sites are flat and paved, other sites are 1000s of years old, in various stages of repair, and may have sloping, rocky paths. In some cases, there may be ladders to climb and caves to crawl through. 

To prepare, you will want to be able to walk about three miles a day and do exercises that focus on ankle strength and balance. If you have any physical limitations, just let our guide know and he or she will help you make an informed decision about whether to stay back at a specific location.{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="I can't go right now.  What should I do?" >}}


* Pray for your friends and family going on the tour that the Holy Spirit will work in us to bring about change and growth.  
* Pray to keep the hands of the enemy far away before during and after the trip! 
* [Donate to offset the costs for our Pastors to attend](https://cbcbonham.breezechms.com/give/online) - select _give to Special Projects_
* Attend virtually! We will have a blog site where we will post updates.  
* Pray that God opens the door for you to go one day.  
  * I (Chris) knew I wanted to go to Israel in 1995, but the door didn't open until 2010.
  * Then once I went, I know I wanted to go again and lead/serve others - God miraculously (i.e. financially) made a way for us to return in 2013 on a service tour.
  * Where God guides, He provides! {{< /spoiler >}}
  
{{< spoiler text="Where were the photos on this page taken?" >}}

* Caesarea Philippi - Matthew 16:13-20
* Tabgha - traditional location Jesus' restoration of Peter in John 21:15-19
* Southern Steps of the Temple Mount - the main entry point into the Temple compound
  *    Likely location where "Psalms of Ascent" (Ps 120-134) were read as pilgrims went up the stairs
  *    Jesus unquestionably would have walked on these steps.  Mark 13:1.  
  *    Also a popular location for teaching per the Talmud, so possibly the location for Luke 2:41-50 and other "Jesus taught in the Temple" passages.
* Hezekiah's water tunnel - 2 Ki 20:20; 2 Chr 32:2
* En Gedi and the Dead Sea - where David fled from Saul wrote many Psalms - 1 Sam 23:29
