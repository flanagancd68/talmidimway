* Are YOU in the full time ministry?  
  * If you are saved by Jesus then the answer is **"YES!"**
* Are you a Bible teacher?
  * If you are called to make disciples, then the answer is **"YES!"**
* A study tour of Israel is an **investment** in your ministry and discipleship
* The late Pastor Chuck Smith used to say, "a week in Israel is like a year in seminary"   * While the cost of international travel is high, this study tour will cost less than a year of seminary tuition (and we won't have any papers to write or exams to take!)

* More than a "vacation," a study tour provides the following benefits:
  * Greater comprehension of the Bible
  * Clearer understanding of biblical applications and "applying the land and it lessons to life" (GTI Tours slogan)
  * More effective communication of biblical truth to others
  * Greater confidence in God's Word - our faith is rooted in real events that occurred in real places
  * A deeper love for Jesus
  * Lessons that come directly from God 
    * _Prayer is when we speak to God; Bible Study is when God speaks to us!_
    
Common Questions:
{{< spoiler text="**What is the Estimated Cost?**" >}}
GTI has informed us to budget around $5000 per person
* Once we can confirm a minimum number of attendees, GTI can confirm the price
  * Prices are up everywhere - Jet and diesel fuel costs are particularly volatile
  * We will do what we can to keep costs down without sacrificing teaching content
  * _We will have the price prior to registration_
  * This price would be consistent with other current current Israel tours (and the three examples below don't include all meals like ours would)
    * First Baptist Dallas 2022: **$5398**
    * Stonebriar Frisco 2022: **$5638**
    * Wayne Stiles (loosely affiliated with Stonebriar) 2022: **$5592**
* **Again, we encourage you to think of this as if you were taking a seminary course**

{{< spoiler text="Is it safe?" >}} I believe Israel is far safer than downtown Dallas.  The country takes security very seriously.  The main conflict area is the Gaza Strip and we won't be anywhere near there. Our guides know to avoid potential trouble-spots, if any exist.  {{< /spoiler >}}
{{< spoiler text="Why is it so expensive?" >}} International travel has always been costly and Israel has always been high from a cost-of-living standpoint.  Just like a hotel in New York City is going to be far more expensive than one in Dallas, a hotel in Israel is going to be more expensive than New York City.  COVID, global inflation, and resulting supply shortages have hit the travel industry hard.  Airfare is likely to be 1/4 to 1/3 of the entire cost.  As of March 2022, the cost of a gallon of gasoline in Israel is well over $9/gallon. 

One reason we are announcing this a year in advance is to give folks the opportunity to save.  Final payment will not be due until early 2023.  This really is the trip of a lifetime! {{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="What is included" >}}

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="What is not included" >}}
* Drinks with meals (other than water)
* Covid tests, if required at the time of our departure

{{< spoiler text="Payment and Cancellation" >}}
Once we confirm our trip is a "go", GTI will begin contracting and pricing.  At that time, we will know the final cost and they will set up an online registration portal.

In looking at similar tours, we can _estimate_ the following deadlines (assuming May 1, 2023 departure)

| Date | Minimum Payment | Cancellation Policy
| :--: | :-- | :--
| Deposit | $500 | Amount paid less $200 for cancellations before 11/7/2022
| 11/7/2022 | N/A | Amount paid less $500 for cancellations after this date
| 12/12/2022 | 50% of balance | Amount paid less $2000 for cancellations after this date
| 3/13/2023 | Remaining Balance | No refunds for cancellations after this date

{{< spoiler text="How do I prepare?" >}}GTI has been leading tours since the early 1990s and they have mastered the art of preparation! They have an extensive [on-line preparation guide](gtitours.org/study-tour-preparation-guide), complete with videos, articles and downloadable checklists. {{< /spoiler >}}
{{< spoiler text="Is the tour strenuous?" >}}While many sites are flat and paved, other sites are 1000s of years old, in various stages of repair, and may have sloping, rocky paths. In some cases, there may be ladders to climb and caves to crawl through. You will want to be able to walk about three miles a day and do exercises that focus on ankle strength and balance. If you have any physical limitations, just let our guide know and he or she will help you make an informed decision.{{< /spoiler >}}
{{< spoiler text="I can't go right now.  What should I do?" >}}
* Pray for your friends and family going on the tour that the Holy Spirit will work in us to bring about change and growth.  
* Pray to keep the hands of the enemy far away before during and after the trip!  
* Attend virtually! We will have a blog site where we will post updates.  
* Pray that God opens the door for you to go one day.  
  * I (Chris) knew I wanted to go to Israel in 1995, but the door didn't open until 2010.
  * Then once I went, I know I wanted to go again and lead/serve others - God miraculously (i.e. financially) made a way for us to return in 2013 on a service tour.
  * Where God guides, He provides! {{< /spoiler >}}
