* Why should you go?
  * Are you in the full-time ministry?  
    * If you are saved by Jesus, then the answer is **"YES, I am in the full-time ministry!"** (2 Timothy 2:15)
  * Are you a Bible teacher?
    * If you are called to be a disciple and to make disciples (especially if you have or will have children or grandchildren), then the answer is **"YES, I am a Bible teacher!"** (Proverbs 3:1-2)
* A study tour provides the following <u>kingdom-focused benefits</u> (Matthew 6:19-21):
  * Greater comprehension of the Bible and biblical applications as we "apply the Land and it lessons to life" (GTI Tours slogan)
  * More effective communication of biblical truth to others
  * Greater confidence in God's Word - our faith is rooted in real events that occurred in real places
  * A deeper love for Jesus and understanding of His model and methods to raise disciples
  * Lessons that come directly from God 
    * _Prayer is when we speak to God; Bible Study is when God speaks to us!_

Common Questions:
{{< spoiler text="**What is the Estimated Cost?**" >}}
We are budgeting around $4800 per person 

This amount is _preliminary_; once we can confirm a minimum number of attendees, GTI can confirm the price (hopefully it will be lower).  Post-COVID, prices are up everywhere - jet and diesel fuel costs are particularly volatile. We will do what we can to keep costs down without sacrificing teaching content.

For comparison, note the costs of other current, post-COVID, Israel tours (and the three examples below don't include three meals/day like ours would)

* First Baptist Dallas 2022: **$5398**
* Stonebriar Frisco 2022: **$5638**
* Wayne Stiles (affiliated with Stonebriar) 2022: **$5592**

**We encourage you to think of this study tour as an investment in your ministry, just as if you were taking a seminary course**

{{< /spoiler >}}
{{< spoiler text="When exactly would we go?" >}}As soon as we can confirm with GTI that the trip is a go (in terms of a minimum interest level) they will begin the process of confirming dates. Mid-April and mid-May are ideal times.  In late May and into the summer it is just too hot. Likely, we would leave on a Monday (such as 4/17/23, 4/24/23, or 5/1/2023) and return to the US a week from the following Friday.{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Is it safe?" >}} Just about everyone who's been there returns with the feeling that Israel is one of the safest places they've ever visited.  The country takes security very seriously.  The main conflict area is the Gaza Strip and we won't be anywhere near there. 

Remember, the media's motto is "if it bleeds, it leads," so they sell fear.  Fear is not from God (1 John 4:18) and millions of tourists visit Israel every year. Our guides are well-connected in terms of security; should any trouble spots arise, we will avoid them. 
{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="What is the COVID situation??" >}} 
As of 3/1/2022, Israel removed the vaccination requirement for international travelers to be vaccinated.  For now, a negative PCR test is still required but we hope this requirement will be dropped by the time we fly.

US Citizens may reenter the country without a vaccine provided they supply a negative test.  Masks are still required on all departing/arriving flights within the US.
{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="What contributes to the cost?" >}} International travel has always been expensive and Israel has always been high from a cost-of-living standpoint.  Just like a hotel in New York City is going to be far more expensive than one in Dallas, a hotel in Israel is going to be far more expensive than New York City.  COVID, global inflation, and resulting supply shortages have hit the travel industry hard.  Airfare is likely to be 1/4 to 1/3 of the entire cost.  As of March 2022, the cost of a gallon of gasoline in Israel is well over $9/gallon. 

Also consider that by going on this study tour, we are supporting people both in the US and in Israel who have essentially had no income for the past two years (Genesis 12:3).

One reason we are announcing this a year in advance is to give folks the opportunity to save.  Final payment will not be due until early 2023. {{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="What is included?" >}}
R/T economy class air | Deluxe Hotels - Buffet dinner and breakfast daily | Lunches served on site | Deluxe motor coach touring | Hydration backpack with bottled water on tour | All transfers, porterage, entrance fees and taxes | Guide and driver tips | Study guides, journals | Pre-trip online course

Many other tours do not include lunches, unlimited water, or the comprehensive study materials, and yet are more expensive than ours will be.  So a lower sticker price on a different tour wouldn't be an "apples-to-apples" comparison. 

GTI structures their tours to be fully "all-inclusive" so we can devote our full attention to the study of His Land.  You would not have to spend a single additional dollar (or in this case, Shekel) if you didn't want to.

{{< spoiler text="What is not included?" >}}
* Drinks with meals (other than water)
* Snacks in-between meals
* COVID tests, if required at the time of our departure
  * As of 3/1/2022, negative COVID tests are still required to enter Israel and re-enter the US. Israel requires no other shots/vaccinations (e.g. COVID, malaria) to enter
* Passport fees 
* Travel insurance 
  * Optional but strongly recommended 
  * Be sure to read COVID cancellation coverage carefully, particularly in the event you are unable or unwilling to travel because of COVID requirements that may be in effect at the time of our departure

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="When are the payment and cancellation deadlines?" >}}
Once we confirm our trip is a "go", GTI will begin contracting and pricing.  At that time, we will know the final cost and they will set up an online registration portal.

In looking at similar tours, we can _estimate_ the following deadlines (assuming May 1, 2023 departure)

| Estimated Date | Minimum Payment | Cancellation Policy
| :--: | :-- | :--
| Deposit | $500 | Amount paid less $200 for cancellations before 11/7/2022
| 11/7/2022 | N/A | Amount paid less $500 for cancellations after this date
| 12/12/2022 | 50% of balance | Amount paid less $2000 for cancellations after this date
| 3/13/2023 | Remaining Balance | No refunds for cancellations after this date

{{< spoiler text="How do I prepare?" >}}GTI has been leading tours since the early 1990s and they have mastered the art of preparation! They have an extensive [on-line preparation guide](https://gtitours.org/study-tour-preparation-guide), complete with videos, articles and downloadable checklists. {{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Is the tour physically strenuous?" >}}One of the aspects of a study tour that is often overlooked is that we engage our bodies with the biblical text - and this can't happen anywhere but Israel (or Greece, Turkey, etc).  We walk where Jesus, Peter and David walked! Verses like Matthew 4:13 that we may have skimmed over in the past now take on a new and vivid significance.

While many sites are flat and paved, other sites are 1000s of years old, in various stages of repair, and may have sloping, rocky paths. In some cases, there may be ladders to climb and caves to crawl through. 

To prepare, you will want to be able to walk about three miles a day and do exercises that focus on ankle strength and balance. If you have any physical limitations, just let our guide know and he or she will help you make an informed decision about whether to stay back.{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="I can't go right now.  What should I do?" >}}
* Pray for your friends and family going on the tour that the Holy Spirit will work in us to bring about change and growth.  
* Pray to keep the hands of the enemy far away before during and after the trip! 
* [Donate to offset the costs for our Pastors to attend](https://cbcbonham.breezechms.com/give/online) - select _give to Special Projects_
* Attend virtually! We will have a blog site where we will post updates.  
* Pray that God opens the door for you to go one day.  
  * I (Chris) knew I wanted to go to Israel in 1995, but the door didn't open until 2010.
  * Then once I went, I know I wanted to go again and lead/serve others - God miraculously (i.e. financially) made a way for us to return in 2013 on a service tour.
  * Where God guides, He provides! {{< /spoiler >}}
