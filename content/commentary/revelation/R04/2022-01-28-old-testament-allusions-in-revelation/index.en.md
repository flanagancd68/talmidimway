There is approximately a 2:1 ratio of Old Testament allusions (404 verses in Revelation and over 800 allusions).[^1]  

There are also several other Old and New Testament cross-references.  While John was certainly familiar with the other Gospels and perhaps some of Paul's writings, keep in mind there was not a "New Testament" as we think of it when John received the Revelation.
