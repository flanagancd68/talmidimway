| Rev 4:1 After these things I looked, and behold, a door was standing open in heaven. And the first voice, which I had heard speaking with me like a trumpet, said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things.”                                                          | Isa 26:20; Ezek 1:1 Rev 1:19; Rev 22:6; John 16:13                                                                                                                                                       |
| Rev 4:2 Immediately I was in the Ruach; and behold, a throne was standing in heaven, and One seated on the throne.                                                                                                                                                                                       | Isa 6:1; Ezek 1:26-28;Dan 7:9 Rev 4:9; Rev 3:21; Rev 5:1,6,7,13; Rev 6:16; Rev 7:9-17; Rev 12:5; Rev 19:4; Rev 21:5; Rev 22:1-3; Isa 6:1; Dan 7:9; Heb 8:1                                               |
| Rev 4:3 And the One who was seated was like jasper and carnelian in appearance, and a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald in appearance.                                                                                                                                                          | Ezek 1:26, 28; 10:1 Rev 21:19; Exo 28:18; Exo 39:11; Eze 28:13                                                                                                                                           |
| Rev 4:4 Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders dressed in white clothes with golden crowns on their heads.                                                                                                                                        | 1 Chron 24:5 Rev 2:10; Rev 9:7; es 8:15; Psa 21:3; 2 Tim 4:8                                                                                                                                             |
| Rev 4:5 And out from the throne come flashes of lightning and rumblings and clashes of thunder—and seven torches of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.                                                                                                                  | Ex 19:16; 25:37; Isa 11:2; Ezek 1:13 Rev 1:4; Rev 3:1; Rev 5:6; Mat 3:11; Acts 2:3; 1 Cor 12:4-11                                                                                                        |
| Rev 4:6 And before the throne was something like a sea of glass, like crystal. In the middle of the throne and around it were four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind.                                                                                                                   | Ezek 1:5, 18, 22, 26;10:1, 12 Rev 4:8; Eze 1:18; Eze 10:12                                                                                                                                               |
| Rev 4:7 The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature was like an ox, the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.                                                                                                   | Ezek 1:10; 10:14 Deut 28:49; 2 Sam 1:23; Isa 40:31; Eze 1:8,10; Eze 10:14; Dan 7:4; ob 1:4                                                                                                               |
| Rev 4:8 The four living creatures, each having six wings, were full of eyes all around and within. They do not rest day or night, chanting, “Kadosh, kadosh, kadosh Adonai Elohei-Tzva’ot, asher haya v’hoveh v’yavo! Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of Hosts, who was and who is and who is to come!” | Isa 6:2-3; Ezek 1:18; 10:12, 14 Rev 4:4; Heb 13:8                                                                                                                                                        |
| Rev 4:9 And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to the One seated on the throne, who lives forever and ever,                                                                                                                                                                   | Deut 32:40; Dan 4:34; 6:26; 12:7 Rev 1:18; Rev 5:14; Rev 10:6; Rev 15:7; Exo 15:18; Psa 48:14; Heb 7:8,25                                                                                                |
| Rev 4:10 the twenty-four elders fall down before the One seated on the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever. And they throw their crowns down before the throne, chanting,                                                                                                                  | Rev 4:4; 1ch 29:11-16; Psa 115:1; 1 Cor 15:10                                                                                                                                                            |
| Rev 4:11 “Worthy are You, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, For You created all things, and because of Your will they existed and were created!”                                                                                                                                   | Gen 1:1 Pro 16:4; Rom 11:36                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Rev 5:1 And I saw in the right hand of the One seated upon the throne a scroll, written on both the front and the back, sealed with seven seals.                                                                                                                                                         | Ezek 2:9-10; Dan 12:4,9; Zech 5:1-4 Rev 6:1; Isa 8:16; Isa 29:11; Dan 8:26; Dan 12:4-9                                                                                                                   |
| Rev 5:2 I also saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?”                                                                                                                                                                              | Lev 25:23-25 Rev 5:5; Isa 29:11,12; Isa 41:22,23                                                                                                                                                         |
| Rev 5:3 No one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it.                                                                                                                                                                                              | Rev 5:13; Isa 40:13,14; Isa 41:28; Rom 11:34                                                                                                                                                             |
| Rev 5:4 I began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Rev 4:1; Dan 12:8,9                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Rev 5:5 Then one of the elders tells me, “Stop weeping! Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed—He is worthy to open the scroll and its seven seals.”                                                                                                                   | Gen 49:9-10; Isa 11:1,10; Hos 5:14 Rev 1:1; Rev 6:1                                                                                                                                                      |
| Rev 5:6 And in the midst of the throne and the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, I saw a Lamb standing, as having been slain—having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.                                                     | Isa 11:2; Zech 3:8-9; 4:10 Rev 4:5                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Rev 5:7 He came and took the scroll from the right hand of the One seated on the throne.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Rev 5:1; Rev 4:2,3                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Rev 5:8 When He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense—which are the prayers of the kedoshim.                                                                                        | Ps 111:2 Rev 8:3,4; Psa 141:2                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Rev 5:9 And they are singing a new song, saying, “You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals.

| Rev 8:2 Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Josh 6:4 Rev 8:6-12; Rev 9:1,13,14; Rev 11:15; Num 10:1-10; 2ch 29:25-28; Amo 3:6-8                                                                                                                      |
| Rev 8:3 Another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a golden incense burner. He was given much incense to offer up along with the prayers of all the kedoshim upon the golden altar before the throne.                                                                                            | Ps 141:2 Rev 6:9; Rev 9:13; Exo 37:25,26; Exo 40:26                                                                                                                                                      |
| Rev 8:4 And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the kedoshim, rose before God from the angel’s hand.                                                                                                                                                                                           | Ps 141:2 Rev 8:3; Rev 15:8; Exo 30:1; Psa 141:2; Luke 1:10                                                                                                                                               |
| Rev 8:5 Then the angel took the incense burner and filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it to the earth; and there were clashes of thunder and rumblings and flashes of lightning and earthquakes.                                                                                              | Ezek 10:2; 8:5,6; Ex 19:16 Rev 11:13,19; 1 King 19:11; Isa 29:6; Zec 14:5; Mat 24:7; Mat 27:52-54; Acts 4:31; Acts 16:26                                                                                 |
| Rev 8:6 Then the seven angels holding the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Ex 19:16 Rev 8:2                                                                                                                                                                                         |
