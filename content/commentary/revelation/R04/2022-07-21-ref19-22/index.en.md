| Rev 19:1 After these things, I heard something like the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, shouting: “Halleluyah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Rev 4:10,11; Rev 5:9-13; Rev 7:10-12; Rev 11:15; Rev 12:10; 1ch 29:11; Psa 3:8; jon 2:9; Mat 6:13; 1 Tim 1:16,17; Ps 104:35                                                                                                                   |
| Rev 19:2 For His judgments are true and just. For He has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her whoring, and has avenged the blood of His servants caused by her hand.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Deut 32:43; Ps 119:137; Jer 51:48 Rev 6:10; Rev 18:20,24; Deut 32:35,43; Psa 19:9; Num 35:19; Rom 12:19                                                                                                                                       |
| Rev 19:3 And a second time they shouted, “Halleluyah! The smoke from her goes up forever and ever!”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Isa 34:9-10; Jer 51:48 Rev 14:11; Rev 18:9,18; Gen 19:28; Isa 34:10; Jude 1:7                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Rev 19:4 Then the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who is seated on the throne, saying, “Amen! Halleluyah!”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Rev 19:1; Psa 106:48; Psa 115:12-13                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Rev 19:5 Then a voice came from the throne, saying: “Praise our God, all you His servants and all who fear Him, both the small and the great!”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Ps 22:23; 134:1; 135:1 Rev 11:18; Rev 20:12                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Rev 19:6 Then I heard something like the voice of a great multitude—like the roar of rushing waters or like the rumbling of powerful thunder—saying, “Halleluyah! For Adonai Elohei-Tzva’ot reigns!                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Ps 93:1; 97:1; Ezek 1:24; 43:2; Dan 10:6 Rev 11:15-18; Rev 12:10; Rev 21:22; Psa 47:2,7; Psa 93:1; Psa 97:1,12; Psa 99:1; Isa 52:7; Mat 6:13; Ex 15:18                                                                                        |
| Rev 19:7 Let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him! For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and His bride has made herself ready,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Isa 52:1; Isa 25:6-9                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Rev 19:8 She was given fine linen to wear, bright and clean!

| Rev 19:9 Then the angel tells me, “Write: How fortunate are those who have been invited to the wedding banquet of the Lamb!” He also tells me, “These are the true words of God.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Rev 19:11; Rev 21:5; Rev 22:6; 1 Tim 1:15; 1 Tim 4:9; 2 Tim 2:11; Titus 3:8                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Rev 19:10 Then I fell down at his feet and worshiped him. But he said to me, “See that you do not do that—for I am only a fellow servant with you and your brothers and sisters who hold to the testimony of Yeshua. Worship God! For the testimony of Yeshua is the Spirit of Prophesy.”                                                                                                                             | Luke 24:25-27,44; John 5:39; Acts 3:12-18; Acts 10:43; Acts 13:27; Rom 3:21,22; 1 Pet 1:10-12; 2 Pet 1:19-21; Col 2:18                                                                                                                        |
| Rev 19:11 Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The One riding on it is called Faithful and True, and He judges and makes war in righteousness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Ps 18:10; 45:3-4; Isa 11:4-5; Ezek 1:1 Rev 15:3-7; Psa 45:3-7; Psa 50:6; Psa 72:2-4; Psa 96:13; Psa 98:9; Psa 99:4; Isa 11:3-5; Isa 32:1; Isa 45:21; Isa 63:1-5; Jer 23:5,6; Jer 33:15; Zec 9:9,10; Heb 7:1,2; Jer 42:5; Titus 2:13           |
| Rev 19:12 His eyes are like a flame of fire, and many royal crowns are on His head.
