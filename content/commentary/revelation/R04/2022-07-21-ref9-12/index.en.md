| Revelation (TLV)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | References                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Rev 9:1 Then the fifth angel trumpeted, and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to earth. The key to the bottomless pit was given to him.                                                                                                                                            | Isa 14:12-14 Rev 9:2,11; Rev 17:8; Rev 20:10; Luke 8:31; Rom 10:7                                                                                                                        |
| Rev 9:2 He opened the pit, and smoke rose from the pit like the smoke of a gigantic furnace. The sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the pit.                                                                                                                                 | Gen 19:28; Ex 19:8 Rev 8:12; Exo 10:21-23; Joel 2:2,10                                                                                                                                   |
| Rev 9:3 Then from the smoke came locusts upon the earth, and power was given to them like the scorpions have power over the earth.                                                                                                                                                        | Ex 10:12-15 Rev 9:5,10,11; Deut 8:15; 1 King 12:11; Eze 2:6; Luke 10:19                                                                                                                  |
| Rev 9:4 They were told to do no harm to the grass of the earth or any green plant or any tree, but only the people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.                                                                                                                    | Ezek 9:4 Rev 7:3,4; Rev 14:1; Exo 12:23; Job 2:6; Eze 9:4,6; Eph 4:30                                                                                                                    |
| Rev 9:5 And they were permitted not to kill them, but to torment them for five months—and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings a person.                                                                                                                       | Rev 9:3                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Rev 9:6 In those days, people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will flee from them.                                                                                                                                                                 | Job 3:21 Rev 6:16; 2 Sam 1:9; Job 3:20-22; Job 7:15,16; Isa 2:19; Jer 8:3; ho 10:8; John 4:8,9; Luke 23:30                                                                               |
| Rev 9:7 Now the appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle. On their heads were something like crowns of gold, and their faces were like human faces.                                                                                                                  | Dan 7:4,8                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Rev 9:8 They had hair like women’s hair, and their teeth were like those of lions.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Joel 1:6 Psa 57:4; Joel 1:6                                                                                                                                                              |
| Rev 9:9 They had chests like iron breastplates; and the noise of their wings was like the noise of many horse-drawn chariots rushing into battle.                                                                                                                                         | Joel 2:5 Job 39:25; Isa 9:5; Joel 2:5-7; Nah 2:4,5                                                                                                                                       |
| Rev 9:10 They have tails like scorpions with stingers; and in their tails is their power to harm people for five months.                                                                                                                                                                  | Rev 9:3,5                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Rev 9:11 They have as king over them the angel of the abyss. His name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he has the name Apollyon.                                                                                                                                                        | Job 26:6; 28:22; 31:12; Ps 88:11; Prov 15:11; 30:27; Amos 7:11 (LXX) John 8:44                                                                                                           |
| Rev 9:12 The first woe is past. Behold, two woes are still coming after these things.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Rev 9:13-21; Rev 8:13; Rev 11:14                                                                                                                                                         |
| Rev 9:13 The sixth angel trumpeted, and I heard a single voice from the four horns of the golden altar before God.                                                                                                                                                                        | Rev 8:3-5; Heb 9:24; Heb 10:21                                                                                                                                                           |
| Rev 9:14 It said to the sixth angel, the one holding the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.”                                                                                                                                                   | Gen 15:18; Deut 1:7; Josh 1:4 Gen 2:14; 2 Sam 8:3; Jer 51:63                                                                                                                             |
| Rev 9:15 So the four angels—who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year—were released to kill a third of mankind.                                                                                                                                                       | Rev 9:18; Rev 8:7,9,11,12                                                                                                                                                                |
| Rev 9:16 The number of mounted troops was two hundred million—I heard their number.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Rev 7:4                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Rev 9:17 Now here is how I saw the horses and those riding on them: they had breastplates that were fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow. The heads of the horses were as heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire and smoke and brimstone.                               | 1ch 12:8; Isa 5:28,29                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Rev 9:18 By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed—by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone that came out of their mouths.                                                                                                                                                  | Rev 9:15,17                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Rev 12:15 And from out of his mouth, the serpent spewed water like a river after the woman, in order to sweep her away with a flood.                                                                                                                                                      | Hos 1:5-10 Rev 17:15; Psa 18:4; Psa 65:7; Psa 93:3,4; Isa 8:7; Isa 28:2; Isa 59:19                                                                                                       |
| Rev 12:16 But the earth came to the aid of the woman. The earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had spewed from his mouth.                                                                                                                                       | Exo 12:35,36; 1 King 17:6; 2 King 8:9                                                                                                                                                    |
| Rev 12:17 So the dragon became enraged at the woman and went off to make war with the rest of her offspring—those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Yeshua.                                                                                                   | Gen 3:15 Rev 12:11; Rev 1:2,9; Rev 6:9; Rev 20:4; 1 Cor 2:1; 1 John 5:10                                                                                                                 |
