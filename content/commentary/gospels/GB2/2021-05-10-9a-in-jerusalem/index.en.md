> Yeshua is IN JERUSALEM, the holy city, for the Passover festival and remains in Judea for a few extra weeks while His disciples immerse new penitents. Meanwhile, John the Immerser moves his work into Samaria and begins immersing “at Aenon near Salim,” leaving Yeshua and His followers to baptize in the area around Jerusalem. Salim is a fertile valley in Samaria east of Shechem.
