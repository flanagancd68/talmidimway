Genesis 1: Summary

God creates the world in six days. On the first day He makes darkness and light. On the second day He forms the heavens, dividing the “upper waters” from the “lower waters.” On the third day He sets the boundaries of land and sea, and calls forth trees and greenery from the earth. On the fourth day He fixes the position of the sun, moon and stars as timekeepers and illuminators of the earth. Fish, birds and reptiles are created on the fifth day; land animals, and then the human being, on the sixth. G‑d ceases work on the seventh day, and sanctifies it as a day of rest.—Chabad.org[^1]

## Gen 1:1

\<small\>\*\*1 In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.\*\*\</small\>

-   XR: Joh 1:1-2 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. \[2\] He was in the beginning with God.

-   We looked at these seven profound words last time.

-   The pattern of sevens is just getting started in this chapter!

-   The “Gap Theory”?

    -   As we noted last time, the structure of the text does not necessarily imply there was any event between verses 1 and 2.

        -   To recap, verse 1 could have been the general statement, then the rest of chapters 1 and 2 circle back and fill in more details.

        -   Biblical Hebrew does not have punctuation and we must not be unduly swayed by the chapter and verse breaks, which came around 900 CE.

        -   It is possible to read verses 1-2 as one sentence or even verses 1-3 as a single sentence.

        -   For a lot of reasons, I side with the majority of scholars who view the seven words and 28 letters of our verse 1 as a single, complete thought.

        -   Let’s look at why people think there is an implied gap.

    -   <span dir="rtl">תֹּהוּ</span> (*tohu)* is the word used in verse 2 for “waste, desolation, empty”. The same word is used in Isaiah 45:18, who says that God did NOT create the earth *tohu.*

    -   There appears to be a contradiction.

    -   From this the so called “gap theory” has emerged – they see some type of gap between verses 1 and 2, where some type of judgment occurred.

        -   To try to support this, people have tried to come up with an alternate translation.

            -   Hebrew doesn’t have verb tenses like English does.

            -   It has completed versus incomplete action, and completed action (the Perfect form) can have any number of English translation options such as “was” (simple past) or “had become.”

                -   This is very much debated.

                -   Most often, a Hebrew verb should be translated as English simple past unless the context of the passage or the form of the verb CLEARLY indicates a nuanced meaning.

            -   Second, the word for “and” can also mean “but.”

            -   Third, the normal Hebrew word order is “verb subject object” but here it is “subject, verb, object” potentially indicating a unique emphasis on the subject, in this case the earth.

        -   Based on this, a minority of scholars would say the verse could be translated, “BUT the earth HAD BECOME formless and void.”

        -   In other words, God created the earth to be perfect, but there was some kind of judgment causing it to become formless, void, and dark.

        -   This judgment then led to the recreation of the surface of the earth in six days.

    -   It’s important to remember there is no life or death on earth until the Fall in chapter 3.

        -   So, people who try to put dinosaurs into this “gap” to conform with modern hypotheses about what killed the dinosaurs or reconcile with evolutionary theory are misguided.

        -   Potentially it is when Satan fell, but even this theory has problems.

    -   Occam’s Razor tells us that the most straightforward explanation is usually the correct one.

    -   The most straightforward explanation to reconcile Genesis 1:2 and Isaiah 45:18, is when God initially created the earth, He didn’t create it to be formless and void (Isaiah). It was momentarily formless, void, and dark (possibly only for a fraction of an instant) until the Ruach Elohim went into action.

        -   God specifically created the darkness - Isa 45:7 I form light and create darkness; I make well-being and create calamity; I am the LORD, who does all these things.

        -   I encourage readers to hold very loosely to any man-made theory about what is going on in Genesis 1-6. We just don’t have a very good concept of what life was like before the Flood and even less insight about what life was like before the Fall.

    -   The Answers in Genesis site has an informative article on this topic: [The Gap Theory – an Idea with Holes.](https://answersingenesis.org/genesis/gap-theory/the-gap-theory-an-idea-with-holes/)

-   Many see the plural *Elohim* together with *Ruach* (breath, spirit) as a hint of the Trinity. While a plain reading of the text doesn’t suggest this, it’s not an unfair “deeper meaning” extrapolation.

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*3 And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.\*\*\</small\>

-   The first utterance by God.

    -   Vayomer is the most frequently occurring verb in Hebrew – it means “and (he) said.

    -   Vayomer Elohim means “and God said”

-   This is not the sun, which won’t be created for a few more days.

-   This is the Light from God Himself – the same light we saw in Revelation chapters 21 and 22, where we have no more need for the sun, moon, and the stars for light.

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*4 And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness.\*\*\</small\>

-   The first of seven “it was good” statements.

## Gen 1:5

\<small\>\*\*5 God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.\*\*\</small\>

-   Hebrew days begin and end at sundown – literally and symbolically, each day moves from darkness to light.

-   Chuck Missler, who has an engineering background sees God instituting order and the physical laws of the planet throughout the creation days (increasing in magnitude and specificity on each of the successive days).

-   In Hebrew, this is a cardinal, not an ordinal number. Not “the first day” (which would have been *yom rishon*, but “day one”, *yom echad.*

-   Genesis 1:1-5 in Hebrew is relatively easy to memorize. I encourage it!

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*6 And God said, “Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.”\*\*\</small\>

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*7 And God made the expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse. And it was so.\*\*\</small\>

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*8 And God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.\*\*\</small\>

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*9 And God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so.\*\*\</small\>

-   

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*10 God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.\*\*\</small\>

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*11 And God said, “Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth.” And it was so.\*\*\</small\>

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*12 The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.\*\*\</small\>

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*13 And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.\*\*\</small\>

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*14 And God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. And let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years,\*\*\</small\>

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*15 and let them be lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth.” And it was so.\*\*\</small\>

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*16 And God made the two great lights—the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night—and the stars.\*\*\</small\>

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*17 And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth,\*\*\</small\>

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*18 to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.\*\*\</small\>

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*19 And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.\*\*\</small\>

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*20 And God said, “Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.”\*\*\</small\>

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*21 So God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.\*\*\</small\>

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*22 And God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”\*\*\</small\>

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*23 And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.\*\*\</small\>

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*24 And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds—livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so.\*\*\</small\>

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*25 And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.\*\*\</small\>

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*26 Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”\*\*\</small\>

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.\*\*\</small\>

-   Love your neighbor application.

    -   Rabbi Pliskin says, “Love of one’s neighbor which is not motivated by the realization that man was created in God’s image is doomed to fail. When we realize that man alone is fashioned (in God’s image), he is suddenly transformed from an inconsequential being into one that is without parallel. He is the pinnacle of Creation.”[^2]

    -   Mic 6:8 He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God.

    -   The slightest act of lovingkindness pleases God because we are honoring another made in His image. This includes a smile to a stranger you will probably never see again.

    -   It can be a challenge to love our neighbor when he or she does not reflect the character of God. The same can be said of you and me when we don’t reflect the image of our Creator.

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*28 And God blessed them. And God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”\*\*\</small\>

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*29 And God said, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit. You shall have them for food.\*\*\</small\>

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*30 And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so.\*\*\</small\>

## Gen 1:

\<small\>\*\*31 And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.\*\*\</small\>
