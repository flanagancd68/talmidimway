## FAQs

{{< spoiler text="Are there prerequisites?" >}}
This course is designed to be used as a supplement to Hebrew Quest, which is a 40-lesson video program available to supporters of Holy Language Institute.  While it is possible to complete the Memrise course stand-alone (without the videos), we designed this course under the assumption the student would first watch the applicable video, then complete the associated work in Memrise.  Other than this, there are no prerequisites for this course.

{{< spoiler text="Do I need the paid version of Memrise to access the course?" >}}
No.  Unfortunately the commercial website sometimes makes it appear that you need to become a premium member, but this is not the case.
