This is part II of the Gospel Backgrounds lesson titled, "Beyond the Jordan."

To begin the lesson, Jesus receives a question from a "rich, young ruler" about what must be done to inherit eternal life. Jesus responds "Keep the Commandments." When the man says that he's done this, Jesus then tells him to sell everything.  We often think that the young man has a "works righteousness" mindset. This is true to some degree, but notice Jesus' answer.  He doesn't say "to get eternal life, all you need to do is accept Me into your heart."  He says first "keep the commandments,".  Then when pressed further, He says, "sell everything, give it to the poor, then follow Me."  There is a lot more going on then it may first appear.  We will take a peek under the hood to get at some of this.

The exchange befuddles the disciples.  They "remind" Jesus that they HAVE left everything and followed their Rabbi.  Jesus assures them that their sacrifices will not go unrewarded.

Matthew 20 begins with one of my favorite parables, the parable of the workers.  A man needs workers for his vineyard.  He finds some early in the day, but also at various points throughout the day, including the "11th hour" right before the work is to end.  This is possibly where our "at the 11th hour" idiom originates from.  When the work is done, the owner calls the workers from last to first and, to the surprise of those hired early, everyone is paid a denarious, a full day's wage.  Those hired early in the day express their belief that this is unfair.  How can people who did 1/12 of the work get paid the same as those who did a full day's work?  The owner replies that the first group agreed to the wage, and besides what He does with his money is his business and no one else's.  

The parable is rich with meaning and has several applications.  We will discuss a few of these in the lesson.

The section concludes with Jesus receiving a request from James and John to sit at Jesus' right and left hands during the millenial kingdom, which is often portrayed as a great banquet.  Instead of rebuking their pride, Jesus explains what it means to sit by his side and "drink His cup".  This act of presumption, naturally, irks the other ten disciples.  Jesus explains that our mission as disciples is not to be serve but to serve.
