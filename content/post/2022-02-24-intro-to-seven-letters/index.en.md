We will find that that each of the Seven Letters in Revelation 2 and 3 contain an identical outline; however not all elements are present in each letter.  We will want to pay particular attention when there are these exceptions.

We will also explore some conjectures.  One view holds that Paul's Seven Letters and the Seven Kingdom Parables have correlations to the Seven Letters of Revelation. A view that is widely held is the so-called "Church Age Theory."  We will explain what that is and what it means.
