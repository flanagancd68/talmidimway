This is a supplement to our Revelation background series. We’re going to take a look at significant events in the period between the Jewish Revolt of 66CE, including the destruction of the Jewish Temple in 70, through the mid-90s that resulted in John’s exile on Patmos, where he received the Revelation. 

> This interval history is surprisingly relevant if we wish to better understand the context for Revelation.

Even if history wasn’t your best subject in school, I believe you’ll find this background helpful as we prepare to study Revelation.
